FBI documents viewed in secure areas of the U.S. Capitol,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI documents about the agency‚Äôs investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server while secretary of state were being reviewed on Wednesday in secure rooms of the U.S. Capitol. Lawmakers and select staff from some congressional committees could page through the material, parts of which are redacted, in large binders labeled ‚Äúsecret‚Äù that the Federal Bureau of Investigation turned over to Congress on Tuesday. Republican lawmakers requested the information last month after the FBI recommended no criminal charges against Clinton. ‚ÄúLast I heard, my colleagues had their turn with the documents at 1:30 p.m.,‚Äù said a Senate Judiciary committee aide. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one set of documents for all the interested Senate committees, as I understand it.‚Äù She said those viewing the material were allowed to take notes. But if notes were taken on the classified parts, those notes had to be left in the secure area with the documents.  Clinton has been dogged for more than a year by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nation‚Äôs top diplomat from 2009 to 2013. Republicans have repeatedly hammered Clinton over the issue, helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness. She faces Republican nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. The FBI said on Tuesday it had provided ‚Äúrelevant materials‚Äù to congressional committees looking into the matter. ‚ÄúThe material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence,‚Äù the agency said in a statement. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday an initial review of the material showed most of it was marked unclassified. Grassley, who has called for unclassified parts of the documents to be made public, wrote on Wednesday to the Senate Security Office, which has custody of the documents, asking them to provide his committee with an unclassified version. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon in a statement also called for the public release of the documents, ‚Äúrather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks.‚Äù The documents on the Senate side of the Capitol are under the control of the Office of Senate Security, Senate aides said. In the House of Representatives, another set was being viewed in a ‚ÄúSecure Compartmented Information Facility,‚Äù an aide with the House Oversight and Government Reform committee said. ‚ÄúOur investigators with (security) clearances have gone down there and looked at the documents,‚Äù the Oversight committee aide said.  It was unclear how many lawmakers had actually seen the material so far. Most members of Congress were not in town because of a congressional recess. The documents were made available to the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Appropriations committees in the Senate, and the Oversight, Judiciary and Appropriations committees in the House, aides said.   The Intelligence committees on both sides of the Capitol also have copies, so they do not have to join the line with the others. ",politicsNews,"August 17, 2016 "
U.S. senator expresses concern about ag tech mergers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two major mergers in agricultural technology and seeds could hurt competition in the industry and make it harder for smaller companies to compete, Senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote in a letter on Wednesday sent to antitrust enforcers. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, urged the Federal Trade Commission, which is reviewing the purchase of Syngenta AG by the China National Chemical Corp [CNNCC.UL], and the Justice Department, which is looking at the merger of Dow Chemical Co and DuPont Co, to coordinate on the two reviews. ‚ÄúIt is important that these transactions not be reviewed in isolation,‚Äù wrote Grassley.¬†‚ÄúI urge the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to collaborate, as appropriate, with input from the Department of Agriculture, in their analysis of the agricultural biotechnology and seed industry and the impact of these proposed transactions.‚Äù Dow and DuPont said in December that they would combine in an all-stock merger with plans to then break into three separate businesses. In February, China‚Äôs state-owned ChemChina [CNNCC.UL] made a $43 billion bid for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta. The deals by some of farmers‚Äô biggest global suppliers concerned Grassley, who represents a largely agricultural state. ‚ÄúI am concerned that the convergence of these proposed transactions ‚Äì as well as others currently being discussed ‚Äì will have an enhanced adverse impact on competition in the industry and raise barriers to entry for smaller companies,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI also am concerned that further concentration in the industry will impact the price and choice of chemicals and seed for farmers, which ultimately will impact choice and costs for consumers. Finally, I am concerned that further consolidation will diminish critical research and development initiatives,‚Äù added Grassley.  The letter was dated Tuesday and sent to FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez and Renata Hesse, the acting head of the Justice Department‚Äôs Antitrust Division. ",politicsNews,"August 17, 2016 "
New Trump campaign manager to push candidate to focus on policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs new campaign manager said on Wednesday she would encourage the Republican presidential nominee to focus on substance and continue delivering policy speeches as he has done in the last week. ‚ÄúKeep giving these policy speeches, because I tell you ... there‚Äôs absolutely zero evidence that the voters want this election to be about this content-free cacophony with no substance and no issues,‚Äù Kellyanne Conway said in an interview with Fox News.  Conway was named to the position on Wednesday by the Trump campaign in a shake-up that also appointed the head of conservative website Breitbart News to the new position of campaign CEO.

Trump campaign chairman helped pro-Russians in Ukraine move money to U.S. firms: AP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, helped a Ukrainian political party with close ties to Russia secretly move at least $2.2 million to two major Washington lobbying firms, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday. The AP, citing sources with direct knowledge of the effort, said the transfers were set up in ways to obscure the Ukrainian party‚Äôs attempts to sway U.S. policies, using a nonprofit organization to distance funds from Ukrainian politicians. U.S. law requires American lobbyists to register and report in detail any ties to foreign political parties or leaders to the U.S. Justice Department. The heads of both firms - Podesta Group Inc and Mercury LLC - told the AP they had concluded their work did not merit disclosure to the department, according to the report. Representatives for Trump and Mercury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Podesta Group Chief Executive Officer Kimberley Fritts said its lawyers worked with those at Mercury to determine that registering under the Foreign Agent Registration Act was unnecessary. It also obtained a statement from the nonprofit in question saying it was not directly or indirectly involved with a foreign entity, she said in an emailed statement.  The Podesta Group was founded in 1987 by Tony Podesta and his brother John, who now is campaign chairman for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. John Podesta has not been with the firm for several years, but his brother is its chairman. The AP report comes less than three months before the Nov. 8 election and as polls show Trump slipping behind Clinton. Trump‚Äôs campaign on Wednesday announced a staff shake-up replacing Manafort as campaign manager after just two months. He will remain chairman and chief strategist. The New York Times this week reported Manafort‚Äôs name was found on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a Ukrainian party with Russian ties. Manafort has denied any impropriety.  Ukrainian officials confirmed Manafort‚Äôs name appeared on a ledger and that more than $12 million had been allocated as an expenditure but said the presence of his name did not mean he received the funds. Clinton‚Äôs campaign has said Manafort‚Äôs associations are a troubling sign of ties between Trump‚Äôs campaign team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine. According to the AP, in 2012 Manafort and associate Rick Gates worked on behalf of Ukraine‚Äôs then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, and helped steer the efforts of European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, an advocacy group that once included members of Yanukovych‚Äôs party.  The group paid at least $2.2 million to the Washington firms to push positions favorable to the party from 2012 until 2014, when Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia, the AP said, citing sources. That work included efforts to counter a potential congressional resolution pressuring Yanukovych to release a political rival from prison, the AP reported. Gates, who also works for the Trump campaign, told the AP his actions were lawful. He said he and Manafort had introduced the advocacy group to the firms and sometimes consulted with the firms on Ukrainian politics, the report said. Podesta‚Äôs Fritts said her firm was unaware that Gates was a consultant to the Ukrainian party when he introduced the advocacy group: ‚ÄúOur assumption was that he was working for the Centre, as we were hired to do.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 17, 2016 "
FBI delivers documents on Clinton email probe to U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Tuesday it had turned over to the U.S. Congress a number of documents related to its probe into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The Democratic presidential nominee has for over a year been dogged by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nation‚Äôs top diplomat. Republicans have repeatedly hammered Clinton over the issue, helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness. The FBI said it had provided ‚Äúrelevant materials‚Äù to congressional committees looking into the matter. ‚ÄúThe material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence,‚Äù the agency said in a statement. The Clinton campaign criticized the delivery of the documents. ‚ÄúThis is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further second-guessing the career professionals at the FBI,‚Äù Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.  ‚ÄúWe believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks.‚Äù A spokeswoman for the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in an email that staff for the panel was reviewing the information classified as ‚Äúsecret.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are no further details at this time,‚Äù the aide said. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said in a statement that an initial review of the material showed most of it was marked unclassified, and urged the FBI to make as much of it public as possible. FBI Director James Comey told Congress last month that Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified information while using  private email servers was ‚Äúextremely careless.‚Äù But he said he would not recommend criminal charges be brought against her. Comey‚Äôs statement lifted a cloud of uncertainty from Clinton‚Äôs White House campaign. But his strong criticism of her judgment ignited a new attack on her by Republicans, including Donald Trump, her Republican opponent in the Nov. 8 election. The Oversight committee, chaired by Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, had asked the FBI for the complete investigative file from its review of Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server. The FBI has also provided documents from its investigation to the House Judiciary Committee, an aide said. Chaffetz and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, also a Republican, last month urged federal prosecutors to investigate whether Clinton had committed perjury. They said some FBI findings about her email servers were at odds with her previous testimony to Congress about the matter, for example, her statement she had not sent or received information designated as classified. But the FBI, in a letter sent to the committee on Tuesday, said the fact that the agency had uncovered three instances in which Clinton had received emails containing ‚Äú(C)‚Äù markings, which denote ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù information, was ‚Äúnot clear evidence of knowledge or intent‚Äù to mishandle such material. The letter, which accompanied the FBI‚Äôs investigative documents, noted relevant emails had been forwarded to Clinton by staff, lacked ‚Äúheader and footer markings‚Äù indicating the presence of classified information, and only one email was later determined by the State Department to contain classified information. Clinton‚Äôs fellow Democrats were scornful that Republicans were refusing to let the matter drop. ‚ÄúThe FBI already determined unanimously that there is insufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing,‚Äù said Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Oversight committee. ‚ÄúRepublicans are now investigating the investigator in a desperate attempt to resuscitate this issue, keep it in the headlines, and distract from Donald Trump‚Äôs sagging poll numbers.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 "
"Clinton names close confidants, Obama veterans to transition team","WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton‚Äôs White House transition team, a mix of former advisers of President Barack Obama, close confidants, long-time colleagues and former elected officials, reflects the sense of careful organization the Democratic candidate has aimed to project in her presidential campaign. But her Republican rival, Donald Trump, could seize on the group to make the point that she is part of the establishment he aims to defeat in November‚Äôs election, and to reiterate his charge that a Clinton administration would be an Obama ‚Äúthird term.‚Äù The group, which the Clinton campaign named on Tuesday and which will lay the groundwork for her to take charge quickly if she wins, is evidence of Clinton‚Äôs long experience in Washington as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady. Transition teams aim to help the president-elect make key decisions during the period between the election and the inauguration, in this case from Nov. 8 to Jan. 20, so the new White House occupant can fill leadership posts quickly. ‚ÄúThey are the names you would expect ‚Äì people who have been advising her for a long time; people who have worked with her for a long time and people who are peers, who she respects,‚Äù Matt Bennett of the moderate Democratic group Third Way said of Clinton‚Äôs transition team.  The group will be headed by Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary and U.S. senator. He will lead four co-chairs: former Obama national security adviser Tom Donilon; former Obama aide Neera Tanden, who now leads the progressive think tank the Center for American Progress; former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams, the director of Harvard‚Äôs Institute of Politics. Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, will be the chief economist. Two additional policy advisers from Clinton‚Äôs campaign, Ed Meier and Ann O‚ÄôLeary, will also move full-time to the transition team, the campaign said in a statement. The transition team does not necessarily reflect future policy. ‚ÄúThe job here is to give options, not just say there is one policy course you want to take,‚Äù said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who advised the presidential campaigns of Al Gore and John Kerry. Clinton would be the first woman elected to the U.S. presidency and Shrum said Clinton‚Äôs team ‚Äúhas got to be the first transition team in history where the majority of its members are women.‚Äù Shrum added that Clinton is largely following Obama‚Äôs template as he prepared for his transition after the 2008 election. Tanden, who played a key role in shaping Obama‚Äôs health care overhaul, is a member of Clinton‚Äôs tight-knit inner circle, and has also worked for her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Williams was the 1992 transition director for Clinton when she became first lady, and then her chief of staff in the White House. Clinton worked closely with Donilon when she led the State Department from 2009-2013. Granholm, the former governor, is also a former state attorney general and has years of experience in Democratic politics. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee applauded the selection of O‚ÄôLeary and Boushey, praising their economic positions. The environmental group Greenpeace criticized Salazar for not curbing fracking in his home state of Colorado. The announcement of the team came as Clinton has gained momentum in the opinion polls, with the current RealClearPolitics average of national polls showing her 6.7 points ahead, at 47.7 percent to Trump‚Äôs 41 percent.  Trump‚Äôs campaign has struggled after he made a string of controversial remarks since formally winning his party‚Äôs nomination last month. More establishment Republicans, alarmed by Trump‚Äôs inability or unwillingness to rein in his provocative remarks, have distanced themselves from the candidate in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial on Monday that he should fix his campaign in the next three weeks or hand over to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his transition team in May. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 "
Liz Cheney claims victory in Wyoming primary for U.S. House seat,"CODY, Wyo. (Reuters) - Liz Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney‚Äôs eldest¬†daughter, claimed victory late on Tuesday in Wyoming‚Äôs Republican primary race for the state‚Äôs lone U.S. House of Representatives seat. Unofficial early results by 10 p.m. (0400 GMT) showed Cheney with 26,363 votes in the nation‚Äôs least populous state. State Senator Leland¬†Christensen was running a distant second, with almost 15,000 votes, while her six other Republican competitors each held fewer than 12,000 votes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honored by the trust Wyoming Republicans have placed in me to serve as our next Representative in Congress,‚Äù Cheney said in a statement. The Casper Star-Tribune newspaper called the race late on Tuesday night. Wyoming is a reliably red state, with the Republican primary winner all but assured of a general election victory in November. Cheney‚Äôs apparent victory comes two years after she launched an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat that saw her withdraw from the race early. She drew criticism from some establishment Republicans two years ago when she ran against popular incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was labeled a ‚Äúcarpetbagger‚Äù for having only¬†recently established residency in Teton County, one of the country‚Äôs wealthiest zip codes, in a state widely populated by working-class miners, oil, and gas workers. She said a family health crisis prompted her to withdraw. Cheney, 49, is a lawyer who worked in the U.S. State Department while her father was vice president. Her campaign has received strong financial support from former high-ranking government officials, such as former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, former¬†Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former White House political adviser Karl Rove. Cheney campaigned as a ‚Äústrong conservative voice for Wyoming,‚Äù promising to protect the state‚Äôs pivotal coal industry, defend gun rights, and generally work ‚Äúto reverse President¬†Obama‚Äôs devastating policies.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 17, 2016 "

Clinton leads Trump by six points in latest Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a 6-percentage-point lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Tuesday. Clinton‚Äôs support has ranged from 41 percent to 44 percent since late July, and was about 41 percent in the Aug. 11-15 online poll. Trump‚Äôs support has experienced wider shifts ranging from 33 percent to 39 percent while his campaign has endured controversies and distractions in recent weeks. He is favored by about 35 percent of likely voters, according to the most recent poll. Trump has caused divisions in the Republican Party with his strong anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric, and faced criticism from both parties earlier this month for a days-long feud with the parents of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq. Last week, 70 Republicans, including former members of Congress and Republican National Committee staff, wrote a letter calling for the RNC to stop helping Trump, whose actions they said were ‚Äúdivisive and dangerous.‚Äù The number of likely voters who picked neither Clinton nor Trump in the poll was nearly 24 percent.  At this point in 2012, President Barack Obama was ahead of Republican nominee Mitt Romney by nearly the same margin, favored by 46 percent of likely voters to Romney‚Äôs 41 percent, with about 13 percent picking neither candidate. Obama and Romney swapped the lead in the poll several times through the summer and early fall before the president took and held the lead in late October. In a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that gave respondents the option to choose from Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton also led Trump by 6 percentage points. Of the alternative party candidates, Johnson came in third with 8 percentage points. Stein had about 2 percentage points.  The Aug. 11-15 polls surveyed a sample of 1,132 and 1,131 likely voters, respectively, and had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 "
"Trump, in law and order speech, calls for African-American support","WEST BEND, WIS. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered his most aggressive call yet to woo African-American voters, vowing to restore law and order, only days after a fatal police shooting of a black man sparked more street violence. Speaking a few miles from Milwaukee, which was rocked by weekend riots, Trump accused his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of ‚Äúbigotry‚Äù and vowed to protect the jobs of minorities from immigrants. Trump has been repeatedly called a ‚Äúbigot‚Äù by his Democratic opponents. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking for the vote for every African-American citizen struggling in our society today who wants a different and much better future,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúJobs, safety, opportunity, fair and equal representation: We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to, and talks down to, communities of color and sees them only as votes ‚Äì that‚Äôs all they care about ‚Äì not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.‚Äù Earlier, Trump held three events in Milwaukee, a city still reeling from violent protests after the death of Sylville Smith, 23. Authorities said Smith was stopped for acting suspiciously and was shot by police because he was carrying an illegal handgun and refused orders to drop it.  Trump encountered only a handful of peaceful protesters while in the city, including some at a closed fundraiser. He held a brief meeting with veterans and law enforcement, including Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and Inspector Edward Bailey. But news media representatives were escorted out and not permitted to hear the discussions.  Clarke, who is black and spoke at last month‚Äôs Republican National Convention, has criticized the protests, writing in an opinion piece for The Hill that they were ‚Äúa collapse of the social order, where tribal behavior leads to reacting to circumstances instead of waiting for facts to emerge.‚Äù Trump also taped a town hall meeting with Fox News, in which he blamed President Barack Obama for what he sees as hostility toward police. ‚ÄúHe has not been good to the police, simply, and the police are not big fans of his,‚Äù Trump said. Trump traveled 45 minutes outside of Milwaukee, which is 40 percent black, to deliver his appeal to African-American voters in the suburb of West Bend, Wisconsin, a community that is 95 percent white. He spoke before an almost entirely white audience.  ‚ÄúA vote for her (Clinton) is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunities,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúCrime and violence is an attack on the poor and it will never be accepted in a Trump administration.‚Äù  Clinton won the Democratic nomination in part thanks to her large victory margins among minorities in nearly every state, including overwhelming support from African-Americans in the South. ‚ÄúWith each passing Trump attack, it becomes clearer that his strategy is just to say about Hillary Clinton what‚Äôs true of himself,‚Äù Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said. ‚ÄúWhen people started saying he was temperamentally unfit, he called Hillary the same. When his ties to the Kremlin came under scrutiny, he absurdly claimed that Hillary was the one who was too close to Putin. ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs accusing her of bigoted remarks - we think the American people will know which candidate is guilty of the charge.‚Äù Trump also took aim at Clinton‚Äôs past acceptance of large speaking fees, saying he would force top administration officials to sign a pledge not to accept speaking fees from corporations with registered lobbyists or foreign countries for five years after leaving office. Police violence against African-Americans has set off intermittent, sometimes violent protests in the past two years, igniting a national debate over race and policing in the United States and giving rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump said critics of the police ‚Äúshare in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and other places in our country.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe war on our police must end and it must end now,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúThe war on police is a war against all peaceful citizens.‚Äù The shooting of Smith was likely justified, Trump argued in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday morning. ‚ÄúBut the gun was pointed at his (a police officer‚Äôs) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? That‚Äôs what the narrative is,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs not true. If it is true, people shouldn‚Äôt be rioting.‚Äù  Officials from the Office of Director of National Intelligence are expected to give Trump a briefing on national security issues this week, an adviser to Trump and a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Presidential candidates are entitled to a briefing of classified information after formally securing the nomination, which Trump did last month. Hillary Clinton, Trump‚Äôs Democratic rival for the Nov. 8 election, is also entitled to receive a briefing if she requests one. Democrats have criticized Trump‚Äôs positions on foreign policy and national security, besides some freewheeling remarks. Democratic President Barack Obama has called Trump ‚Äúunfit‚Äù for the presidency and this month warned the Republican candidate that briefing information must be kept secret.

U.S. offers states help to fight election hacking,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The government is offering to help states protect the Nov. 8 U.S. election from hacking or other tampering, in the face of allegations by Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump that the system is open to fraud. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told state officials in a phone call on Monday that federal cyber security experts could scan for vulnerabilities in voting systems and provide other resources to help protect against infiltration, his office said in a statement. Trump has questioned the integrity of U.S. election systems in recent weeks, but his allegations have been vague and unsubstantiated. The attempts to sow doubts about the 2016 election results  coincided with Trump‚Äôs slide in opinion polls against Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton and missteps in his campaign. His complaints have focused on fears of voter fraud - that people will vote more than once - rather than election rigging. ‚ÄúI mean people are going to walk in, they‚Äôre going to vote 10 times maybe. Who knows? They‚Äôre going to vote 10 times. So I am very concerned and I hope the Republicans are going to be very watchful,‚Äù Trump said in an Aug. 3 interview. President Barack Obama dismissed the claims as ‚Äúridiculous.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?‚Äù Obama said at a news conference the next day. In his phone call, Johnson encouraged the state officials to comply with federal cyber recommendations, such as making sure electronic voting machines are not connected to the internet while voting is taking place, the department said. Concerns in both parties about manipulation of electronic electoral systems are not new. Hackers can wreak havoc in myriad ways, from hijacking a candidate‚Äôs website to hacking voting machines or deleting or changing election records. An Electronic Privacy Information Center report this week said 32 of the 50 states would allow voting by insecure email, fax and internet portals in this election cycle.

Trump ignored facts with dig at Merkel's refugee policy: German minister,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ignored the facts with his assertion that German Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs open-door refugee policy had resulted in a huge increase in crime, a German minister told Reuters on Tuesday. Trump said Merkel‚Äôs decision to welcome more than a million refugees to Germany was a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù during a campaign rally in Ohio on Monday and said his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton wanted to be like the German leader. ‚ÄúIn short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America‚Äôs Angela Merkel and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúCrime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe.‚Äù Statistics compiled by the German Interior Ministry showed the number of crimes reported in 2015 - excluding visa violations and other immigration violations - remained essentially unchanged from the previous year at 5.9 million. Michael Roth, Germany‚Äôs European affairs minister, told Reuters Trump‚Äôs statement was incorrect and it was important to correct campaign statements in other countries that were based on ‚Äúfears, lies and half-truths‚Äù, given the importance of the U.S. election for the world. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that the Republican presidential candidate trumpets out things like that without any factual basis,‚Äù Roth said. ‚ÄúIf he had studied the actual situation in Germany, he would know that, while the many refugees who came to Germany and Europe pose a big challenge for us, and everything is still not completely resolved, they have not led to a massive increase in crime rates.‚Äù Roth said Germany remained a peaceful country where people treated each other with respect, and efforts continued to integrate the refugees into the broader society and economy.

Trump names six U.S. governors as agricultural advisors,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump named 64 agriculture policy advisors on Tuesday, including the governors of Iowa and five other farm states and a former federal agriculture secretary. The announcement came as Trump, a New York businessman seeking his first elected office, looks to improve his standing among voters, particularly those in swing states such as Iowa, where some recent opinion polls show Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a tight race.  Republican Governors Terry Branstad of Iowa, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota, Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska were included on a list of advisors distributed by Trump‚Äôs campaign. Branstad spokesman Ben Hammes said in an interview that the governor will focus on increasing government support for renewable energy as part of the committee. Also on the list were John Block, U.S. agriculture secretary under Republican President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1986, and former Governors Rick Perry of Texas and Jim Gilmore of Virginia, who both unsuccessfully ran against Trump for the Republican nomination. ‚ÄúThe members of my agricultural advisory committee represent the best that America can offer to help serve agricultural communities,‚Äù Trump said in a statement. Members of an executive board will ‚Äúconvene on a regular basis,‚Äù he said. Committee members have already talked via telephone to outline some of the issues they expect to tackle, committee member A.G. Kawamura said in an interview. They range from immigration and climate change to global trade and ‚Äúhow to define food and energy security for the U.S. in the years ahead,‚Äù said Kawamura, a former California agriculture secretary. Battles between the agriculture sector and its critics have grown fierce in recent years - from fights over water access in California and declining grain prices, to mounting pressure from consumer groups over how food is produced and labeled. Both presidential campaigns have largely ignored the sector, though, Kawamura said, adding that lack of discussion was one of the reasons he joined Trump‚Äôs committee. In June, representatives of about a dozen agricultural associations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union, met with staffers for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the first time to begin a discussion on farm policy. Clinton had a 6-percentage-point lead over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 "
Trump to receive first security briefing: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to receive his first national security briefing this week from intelligence officials, sources said on Tuesday. Representatives from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence will give the New York businessman a wide-ranging briefing on foreign policy and national security issues and current threats, but not ultra-sensitive information about ongoing U.S. undercover spy operations or the identities of intelligence sources and methods, according to a source familiar with the matter. The Director of National Intelligence serves as the head of the U.S. intelligence community, advising the president, the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council on matters related to national security. ‚ÄúI know that there will be a briefing, and it will be this week,‚Äù Trump foreign policy adviser Walid Phares confirmed in an email to Reuters. ABC News reported that Trump will be accompanied to the briefing by two top advisers, General Michael Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency chief, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who heads Trump‚Äôs White House transition team. A source familiar with briefing procedures said that it was unclear whether Flynn and Christie currently have the type of active security clearances that would allow them to participate in such a briefing but that they likely held them in the past. Neither Flynn nor a campaign spokeswoman immediately responded to requests for comment on the briefing. Officials have expressed some concern about whether Trump, who has never held public office, will be able to keep sensitive secrets he might hear to himself. Republicans have pointed out Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, when secretary of state, used a personal email system to transmit allegedly sensitive government messages, some of which were classified ‚ÄúTop Secret‚Äù after the fact. There was no indication on Tuesday that Clinton has thus far requested such a briefing for herself, sources familiar with the briefing process told Reuters. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 "

Former Fox News chief Ailes is not advising Trump: campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman ousted last month after sexual harassment allegations, is not advising Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before the presidential debates in the fall, the campaign said on Tuesday. ‚ÄúHe is not advising Mr. Trump or helping with debate prep. They are longtime friends but he has no formal or informal role in the campaign,‚Äù the campaign said.  Earlier, the New York Times had reported that Ailes was advising Trump ahead of the Sept. 26 first presidential debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in a role that could stretch beyond the initial Long Island, New York debate.  Ailes resigned from his post as chairman and chief executive of Fox News Channel last month, ending his 20-year reign over the conservative cable news channel, after Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson sued the 76-year-old claiming sexual harassment.

Clinton names Obama veterans to White House transition team,"WEST HARRISON, N.Y. (Reuters) - Looking to lay the groundwork for her presidency if she wins the White House in November, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton named several veterans of President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration for her transition team on Tuesday. Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary and U.S. Senator from Colorado, will lead a team of four co-chairs including one-time national security adviser Tom Donilon and Neera Tanden, a former Obama aide who now leads the progressive Center for American Progress think-tank, the Clinton campaign said. The other co-chairs are former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams, director of Harvard‚Äôs Institute of Politics, the campaign said in a statement. The announcement came as Clinton has gained momentum in the opinion polls against Republican rival Donald Trump, whose campaign has struggled after he made a string of controversial remarks since formally winning his party‚Äôs nomination last month. Clinton leads Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election by more than 5 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday. The current RealClearPolitics average of polls shows her 6.7 points ahead. Clinton has been a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady and her transition team includes old names from her long tenure in Washington, some of whom have also served Obama. Tanden, who played a key role in shaping Obama‚Äôs health care overhaul, is a longtime friend and adviser to Clinton who worked on her Senate campaign. Williams was the 1992 transition director for Clinton when she became first lady, and then her chief of staff in the White House when Bill Clinton was president. Two policy advisers on the campaign, Ed Meier and Ann O‚ÄôLeary, will also move full time to the transition team.  Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, will be the chief economist, the campaign said in a statement. Boushey has advised the campaign on economic policy. Transition teams oversee personnel appointments and help develop an administrative framework during the period between the November election and the inauguration in January, to make it easier for a new president to begin implementing policy agendas. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his own transition team in May. More establishment Republicans, alarmed by Trump‚Äôs inability or unwillingness to rein in his provocative remarks, have distanced themselves from the candidate in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial on Monday that he should fix his campaign in the next three weeks or hand over to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Trump drew heavy criticism after engaging in a prolonged spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq. Last week, he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement critics found alarming but which he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her. Trump also called Obama and Clinton the ‚Äúco-founders‚Äù of Islamic State, a false claim he later said was sarcastic but did not wholly abandon. Despite Clinton‚Äôs lead in polls, Obama warned Democrats against over confidence, telling a fundraising gathering on Monday in Massachusetts, ‚ÄúIf we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 "
Trump promises to work with NATO to defeat Islamic State,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump said on Monday he would work closely with NATO allies to defeat Islamic State militants if he wins the White House, reversing an earlier threat that the United States might not meet its obligations to the Western military alliance. In a policy speech, Trump said he would wage a multi-front ‚Äúmilitary, cyber and financial‚Äù war against Islamic State, although it was not clear how that would differ from the Obama administration‚Äôs fight with the jihadist group.  ‚ÄúWe will also work closely with NATO on this new mission,‚Äù said Trump, whose remarks about the defense organization earlier this summer drew heavy criticism from allies and even some of his fellow Republicans. Trump said a newly adopted approach to fighting terrorism by the organization had led him to change his mind and he no longer considered NATO obsolete. He was apparently referring to reports the alliance is moving toward creating an intelligence post in a bid to improve information sharing.    While Trump appeared to claim credit for prodding NATO to focus more on the threat of terrorism, the 28-nation alliance has been grappling with the issue for more than a decade. NATO invoked Article 5, its collective self-defense mechanism, for the first time in its history to offer support to the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Trump called for shutting down access to the internet and social media for those aligned with Islamic State, which holds territory in Syria and Iraq. But he said he did not want to detail military strategy because it would tip off potential foes. ‚ÄúWe will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we‚Äôve faced at every age and before,‚Äù Trump said, blaming his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, and President Barack Obama for aiding the rise of Islamic State. In a speech in the swing state of Ohio, Trump also said that in implementing his call for a temporary ban on Muslims immigrating to the country, he would institute ‚Äúextreme vetting‚Äù and develop a new screening test to try to catch people who intend to do harm to the United States. As president, he said, he would ask the U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security to identify regions of the world that remain hostile to the United States and where normal screening might not be sufficient to catch those who pose a threat. The Clinton campaign said Trump‚Äôs plan to have immigrants submit to ideological tests was ‚Äúa cynical ploy to escape scrutiny of his outrageous proposal to ban an entire religion from our country and no one should fall for it.‚Äù Reading from a teleprompter, Trump said Clinton did not have the judgment and character to lead the country. ‚ÄúImportantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face,‚Äù he said.  Trump, a wealthy New York businessman whose volatile campaign has alienated some in the Republican establishment, faced a fresh rebuke on Monday as he falls behind Clinton in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial he should fix his campaign within weeks or step down. Echoing growing alarm about Trump‚Äôs candidacy among many leading Republicans, the newspaper said Trump had failed to establish a competent campaign operation. ‚ÄúIf they can‚Äôt get Mr. Trump to change his act by Labor Day, the GOP will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the Senate and House and other down-ballot races,‚Äù the newspaper said. Labor Day, which falls on Sept. 5 this year, marks the end of U.S. summer vacations and traditionally launches the final phase of the long U.S. election season.  ‚ÄúAs for Mr. Trump, he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be president - or turn the nomination over to Mike Pence,‚Äù it said, referring to the Indiana governor, who is Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate. Adding to Trump‚Äôs woes this week was the news, first reported by The New York Times, that the name of his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a Ukrainian political party with close ties to Russia.  Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement on Monday.   ‚ÄúI have never received a single ‚Äòoff-the-books cash payment‚Äô as falsely ‚Äòreported‚Äô by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia,‚Äù he said.  Artem Sytnik, the head of Ukraine‚Äôs anti-corruption bureau, confirmed in a briefing with reporters that Manafort‚Äôs name appeared on a ledger and that more than $12 million had been allocated as an expenditure, referencing Manafort. But Sytnik said the presence of Manafort‚Äôs name ‚Äúdoes not mean that he definitely received this money.‚Äù The Clinton campaign said the news was evidence of ‚Äúmore troubling connections between Donald Trump‚Äôs team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine.‚Äù Trump has spoken favorably in the past of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last month, he invited Russian hackers to find ‚Äúmissing‚Äù emails from Clinton‚Äôs time as secretary of state, when she used a private email server to conduct government business, although he later described that comment as sarcasm.    The current RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls puts Clinton 6.8 points ahead of Trump, at 47.8 percent to Trump‚Äôs 41 percent. Polls also show Trump trailing in states such as Pennsylvania that are likely to be pivotal in the election. ",politicsNews,"August 15, 2016 "
North Carolina asks Supreme Court to reinstate voter ID law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Carolina on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow a state law requiring voters to show identification to remain in effect for the Nov. 8 U.S. election despite an appeals court decision that the measure discriminates against minority voters. Lawyers for Republican Governor Pat McCrory said the status quo should be maintained so close to the election, citing court precedent in their favor. The law, which also limited early voting, was enacted in 2013.     The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on July 29 that the law intentionally discriminated against minority voters. The same court refused to put its decision on hold for the November election. Critics say such laws, passed in Republican-governed states, make voting harder for minorities such as African-Americans and Hispanics, who tend to support Democrats. Backers say the laws are necessary to prevent voter fraud. The state directed its request to Chief Justice John Roberts, who has responsibility for emergency requests arising from the federal appeals court that covers the state. The state is not seeking to restore all provisions of the law that were invalidated, meaning some provisions will not be in effect for the election whatever the high court does.

Republican Asia experts say Trump presidency would be 'ruinous',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Asia experts who served in past Republican administrations said on Monday they would back Hillary Clinton in the presidential race as a Donald Trump presidency would lead to ‚Äúruinous marginalization‚Äù for the United States in the region. In an open letter, the eight former senior officials said that with global strategic competition growing, including from China, it was ‚Äúabsolutely the wrong time to elect an unstable, ill-prepared amateur with no vision or foresight to meet the manifold challenges of the 21st century.‚Äù They said the Republican nominee offered ‚Äúonly bluster or preposterous panaceas‚Äù for Asia that would ‚Äúwreck our country‚Äôs credibility, economy, and leadership in very short order.‚Äù The signatories to the letter included Michael Green, who served as President George W. Bush‚Äôs top Asia adviser at the White House, James Clad, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, and Patrick Cronin, a former senior official at the U.S. Agency for International Development. Should Trump get the chance to put his ‚Äúnostrums‚Äù into practice, Asian countries would be forced to shift towards states challenging the United States, most notably China, and some might seek security through nuclear weapons, the former officials said. ‚ÄúIn short, if the Trump brand ... becomes America‚Äôs brand, we can expect ruinous marginalization in Asia and unwanted compliance with rules which the Chinese and other challengers set,‚Äù they said. Their letter was the latest repudiation of Trump‚Äôs candidacy by Republican national security specialists. Last week, 50 former Republican national security officials, including a former CIA director, called Trump unqualified to lead and said he would be ‚Äúthe most reckless president in American history.‚Äù Trump responded to that statement by deriding the signatories as members of ‚Äúthe failed Washington elite‚Äù who ‚Äúdeserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.‚Äù Trump has caused alarm in Asia and beyond by saying he would consider letting Japan and South Korea build their own nuclear weapons, rather than have them relying on the United States for protection against North Korea and China. While making U.S. allies anxious, Trump has also irritated Beijing with his comments, such as by comparing the U.S. trade deficit with China to rape. One Chinese state newspaper equated him to Hitler. At the same time, Beijing also sees Trump as a businessmen with whom it could probably negotiate and may also hope he would be less tough on human rights than Clinton.

Obama warns Democrats against overconfidence about Clinton victory,"CHILMARK, Mass. (Reuters) - Declaring he was tired of talking about Donald Trump, President Barack Obama urged Democrats on Monday not to grow too confident about their prospects in the 2016 election despite Hillary Clinton‚Äôs strong position in the race for the White House. Obama, who is on a two-week vacation in Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, took a short break from his relaxation time to raise money for Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee he hopes will succeed him when he leaves office in January. Clinton leads Trump in opinion polls, and the Republican nominee‚Äôs campaign has suffered following remarks he made denigrating the parents of a fallen Muslim American soldier and charging that Obama was the founder of the Islamic State militant group. The president warned his party, however, to maintain a sense of urgency until the Nov. 8 election.  ‚ÄúIf we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake,‚Äù Obama told some 60 donors who contributed $10,000 each to attend the fundraiser at a private home on the island. ‚ÄúIf we do our job, then Hillary will be elected president of the United States. But if we do not do our jobs, then it‚Äôs still possible for her to lose.‚Äù The remarks could foreshadow the president‚Äôs role this fall in encouraging get-out-the-vote efforts for Clinton, his former secretary of state.  Obama has made clear his disdain for Trump, calling him unqualified for the White House. He told the donors he was tired of talking about Clinton‚Äôs rival. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to make the case against her opponent, because every time he talks he makes the case against his own candidacy,‚Äù Obama said.

Republicans seek Trump presidency votes in Israel,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Israeli branch of the U.S. Republican party began a campaign on Monday to get American voters living in Israel to cast absentee ballots in favor of Donald Trump. According to the Israeli chapter of the Republican party, around 300,000 Americans are eligible to vote in the November presidential elections. They live in Israel or in settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Marc Zell, the head of Republicans Overseas Israel branch,  said the campaign aimed to rekindle interest in U.S. politics among second- and third-generation citizens, many of whom have children who will be eligible to vote for the first time. ‚ÄúWe want to try to attract new voters who perhaps in the past had no special interest in voting in the U.S. elections,‚Äù Zell told Reuters. Tzvika Brot, who is heading the campaign, estimated that about three-quarters of American-Israelis would support the Republican party. A Democratic party representative in Israel disputed that estimate, telling Israel Radio the majority of Israeli and U.S. Jewish voters had always preferred the Democrats. A poll of Jewish Israelis conducted in May found 40 percent of respondents backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and 31 percent supported Trump. The poll didn‚Äôt specify whether those who responded were eligible to vote in the U.S. election. The pro-Trump drive opened at a shopping mall in the central Israeli town of Modiin and will focus on areas with high concentrations of American-Israelis. Brot said he hoped the new votes being sought might help tip the balance in swing states.  Trump, who has accused the administration of President Barack Obama of lacklustre support for Israel, won his party‚Äôs nomination for the presidency last month. He has rejected last year‚Äôs nuclear deal with Iran and called for more investment in missile defense in Europe. His views, including a vow to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and a proposal to impose a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country, have polarized the Republican party and caused widespread consternation. Trump has also been criticized for his lack of foreign policy knowledge. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said last month he would put at risk U.S. and world security with his ‚Äúpolitics of fear and isolation‚Äù. ",politicsNews,"August 15, 2016 "
Trump rails against press in response to reports of chaos,"FAIRFIELD, Conn. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump on Saturday repeated his attack on President Barack Obama that he helped ‚Äúfound‚Äù Islamic State and railed against media reports that his campaign is failing, at a campaign rally in Connecticut, a state where he has a long-shot of being victorious.  Speaking for more than an hour in a sweltering room, Trump spent a significant portion of his speech complaining about the media.    He again threatened to revoke the press credentials of The New York Times. The credentials allow reporters access to press-only areas of his campaign events. He has already banned other outlets, including The Washington Post.  On Saturday, the New York newspaper published an article detailing failed efforts to make Trump focus his campaign on the general election. ‚ÄúThese are the most dishonest people,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll start thinking about taking their press credentials away from them.‚Äù      Trump visiting Connecticut, a heavily Democratic state, raised eyebrows among many Republicans. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs asinine that he would be in Connecticut holding a public rally less than 90 days before the election,‚Äù said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt see Hillary publicly campaigning in Idaho and Mississippi. I have to think this proves the candidate is running the campaign, which explains why it‚Äôs such a disaster of biblical proportions.‚Äù At several points the crowd chanted ‚Äúlock her up,‚Äù a frequent campaign rally chant in reference to Trump‚Äôs Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  Trump told the crowd that normally he responds by saying he intends instead to defeat her in the Nov. 8 election, but this time added, ‚ÄúYou know what?

Democrats and Republicans alike have criticized Trump‚Äôs assertion as patently false.     Trump took a detour from attacking Clinton‚Äôs economic record to discuss the 1998 scandal involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky and former President Bill Clinton, whom Republicans attempted to impeach.  ‚ÄúRemember when he said, he did not have sex with that woman, and a couple of weeks later, oh you got me,‚Äù Trump said, to cheers.

Talk of shifting funds away from Trump premature: Republican official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior official with the Republican National Committee on Sunday played down the prospect that the party would cut off cash and logistical support to White House nominee Donald Trump in order to shift resources toward congressional races. Last week 70 Republicans wrote a letter urging the RNC to stop helping Trump and to focus instead on candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The letter, signed by former members both of Congress and RNC staff, said Trump‚Äôs actions were ‚Äúdivisive and dangerous‚Äù and posed a threat to the party and the country.  Sean Spicer, RNC communications director, said in a telephone interview that abandoning Trump with nearly three months to go to the Nov. 8 election ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt make logical sense.‚Äù  In October 1996 the RNC moved money from the presidential race to congressional candidates after Republican nominee Bob Dole fell far behind Democratic President Bill Clinton in opinion polls. But Spicer said giving up on Trump could be harmful to other Republican candidates and there was still time for him to rebound in opinion polls against Democrat Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúNumber one, you need a strong top of the ticket. That‚Äôs number one. Number two, we‚Äôre only six points down,‚Äù Spicer said, referring to the gap that Clinton has opened up against Trump in some national polls. Clinton led Trump by more than five percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. Clinton has strong leads in hotly contested states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire and some polls show her within a few percentage points of Trump in some states such as Georgia that normally lean strongly Republican. Any discussions of cutting off funds to Trump in August would be ‚Äúridiculous,‚Äù Spicer said. Trump has polarized the party with his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and his plan to impose a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country. Trump has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats for a prolonged feud with the Muslim family of a fallen U.S. Army captain and his assertion last week that President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had co-founded the Islamic State militant group.

"Disillusionment, U.S.A. Where voters are just hoping for change.","ALGONAC, MICH.‚ÄîParker Fox drifted out of the Donald Trump rally in a sort of euphoric daze, along with the thousands emptying into the parking lot alongside him. ‚ÄúAfter leaving a Trump rally, you‚Äôre very pro-Trump,‚Äù he recalled a few weeks later, describing a noisy communion with people who understood that politics mattered, unlike some people he could name at his high school. ‚ÄúIt was so enthusiastic and so energetic you could feel it in your body. It gave you chills.‚Äù He‚Äôd barely had time to calm down when he learned through Facebook that his other favorite presidential candidate would also be passing through his quiet corner of eastern Michigan‚ÄîBernie Sanders. In fact, the U.S. senator from Vermont would be at the same community college the very next day. This thrilled Fox: his first presidential election as a voter‚Äîhe was 18‚Äîand the two most crowd-whipping, pundit-defying, establishment-bucking candidates in the entire race were practically paying him personal visits.  As it turned out, the residents of this part of Michigan were especially fond of the two men who had done the most to upend the 2016 presidential race. Both Sanders and Trump won the state, with Sanders‚Äô narrow win in the Democratic contest stupefying pollsters who had predicted a comfortable lead for Hillary Clinton. Both did especially well in St. Clair County, with double-digit victories over their rivals. And, down at the precinct level, they barnstormed Algonac, a town of about 4,056 people about an hour‚Äôs drive from Detroit on a curve of the St. Clair River in the county‚Äôs southern end corner, and neighboring Clay, home to another 9,066 or so, including Fox and his family. In some Algonac and Clay precincts, Sanders and Trump won more than two thirds of the votes. Residents have a needlessly unflattering nickname for Algonac: The Swamp, derived, apparently, from the reed marshes that engulf the town‚Äôs edges and which are prettily dive-bombed by feeding birds and buzz with hidden insects. If Sanders and Trump were the two insurgents of 2016, then the Algonac Swamp must be a sort of encampment of their guerrilla foot soldiers. What might such a place be like, down in the trenches? An editor‚Äôs working hypothesis was that a town full of Trump and Sanders fans might turn out to be the Angriest Town in America, and so that became our shorthand before my visit in April, only to be laughed at when I finally got the chance to broach the label with residents.   Of course, no one can persist in a permanent state of anger, especially in an entire town. Contempt, on the other hand, can smolder indefinitely, and Algonac reeked of contempt: It would take longer than a week‚Äôs visit to find someone here who does not think Washington is, on the whole, a besmirched place of selfish politicians in thrall to the powerful moneyed interests who keep them in office. Clinton, fairly or otherwise, is generally seen here as the very embodiment of this; Sanders and Trump the only possible saviors, Trump because he‚Äôs never held elected office, and Sanders, despite his decades in Congress, because he is still viewed as a cranky outsider. Nonetheless, for a small minority, the idea of a President Trump sends them into a panic.  Fox is young enough to have never had his heart broken by a politician, but he‚Äôs heard his father, Jerry, go off at the dinner table enough times to pick up some of his parents‚Äô wariness. ‚ÄúHe might get a lot of this because I work for the auto industry,‚Äù said Jerry, who has a job at a nearby Chrysler truck factory and is a competitive walleye fisherman on the side. Father and son were sitting on couches in the family‚Äôs comfy living room, with large windows looking out onto surrounding woods where deer and turkeys roam. Jerry had also been struggling over whether he preferred Trump or Sanders, and so had decided to let his politics-inhaling son make the call for him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always heard dad saying, you know, ‚ÄòThere goes another plant to Mexico,‚Äô‚Äù Fox said, doing an angry-dad voice, as Jerry gave a smiling ‚Äúit‚Äôs true‚Äù nod of recognition. And so Fox marveled to hear Trump lambast companies for moving production abroad, or Sanders‚Äô refrain that 60,000 factories have closed down in America since 2001. The rallies were like a Fox family dinner blown up to stadium size. COMPASSION VERSUS WALL-BUILDING Should either candidate want to make a movie adaptation of their campaign speeches, they could do worse than to set it in Algonac and Clay: A few strip-mall businesses and a scattering of mostly two-story, middle-class homes, none too far from the teal waters of the St. Clair River, along which massive freighters creep carrying goods to and from Canada. To wander around Algonac, a predominantly Republican place, is to encounter familiar stump-speech lines made manifest. There‚Äôs the town‚Äôs old Chris-Craft power boat factory that made Algonac a proud little manufacturing hub until it closed in 1960, a hole that‚Äôs never quite been filled or forgotten. Algonac falls within the gravitational pull of Detroit‚Äôs Big Three automobile companies; the factories of General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler are major employers, and families‚Äô fortunes are tied to international trade deals that both Trump and Sanders deride. Ford, in particular, has come under attack from Trump for expanding its manufacturing in Mexico. The only other language besides English on the signs at the nearest major airport, Detroit Metropolitan, is Japanese, viewed by some residents as an unnecessary concession to visiting Japanese automobile executives. When talk turns to immigration‚ÄîSanders in terms of compassion, Trump in terms of wall-building‚Äîpeople here are reminded of the U.S. Border Patrol officers they see boating up and down the Canadian border, which floats somewhere halfway across the St. Clair River. Both candidates decry what they say is the undue influence of American billionaires on politics. In Algonac, they tend to picture Manuel Moroun, a Detroit businessman, in the local version of this role. He proposed building a bridge that was widely opposed here, connecting the mainland to Harsens Island, a peaceful outpost of Clay Township, home to about 1,200 people and a couple of bald eagles and currently accessible only by a small, 12-car ferry. Regulators denied the $45 million plan in June. In some ways, voters have changed little since the 1980s, when pollster Stan Greenberg first visited neighboring Macomb County and announced that he had discovered the Reagan Democrat. The belief persists that the system is so rigged that politicians‚Äô largesse only flows to those much richer than you, or much poorer, leaving you to struggle unaided. The difference this time‚Äîand everyone agrees it‚Äôs different this time‚Äîis that there were two viable-seeming chances to send a man to Washington who would be the very personification of your contempt. Some were voting for Trump only in his capacity as a stink bomb. ‚ÄúYou guys know the story, I‚Äôm sure, of Jesus Christ in the temple, when he goes into the temple and he turns everything upside down,‚Äù said Jay DeBoyer, the only person dressed in a suit on a weekday afternoon in Johnnie Lega‚Äôs, a popular riverside Algonac dive bar filled with nautical-themed clutter. He worked behind the bar years ago when he was a student before becoming a salesman for a company that made trusses and other lumber products for the home-building industry. Now DeBoyer is the county clerk, whose job includes running elections here. He has a close-shaved head and silver goatee, his suit fits well, and he speaks in neat paragraphs of political analysis. He was evoking a rare moment in the Gospels, in which the normally sanguine Christ appears to get angry at the corrupting quality of money, as he explained why the county‚Äôs primary results were more or less as he anticipated. ‚ÄúNow, we can argue from a Christian perspective, was that Christ-like? We can have that debate, that discussion. But for every circumstance there‚Äôs a reaction and there‚Äôs a resolution.‚Äù In his analogy, Christ was Trump, but Sanders, too, and also, in a sense, the voters themselves, newly awakened at the possibility of disruption. ‚ÄúIn these non-engaged individuals who are becoming engaged, they want him to go into the temple and turn the tables upside down,‚Äù DeBoyer said. ‚ÄúThat means we need to shake it up. We need to come back to the people in control.‚Äù In DeBoyer‚Äôs view, this may be the first election in which the so-called culture wars will not prove decisive. DeBoyer is a Republican, though he declined to say for whom he voted. He‚Äôs pro-gun and opposes abortion, but is unfazed, for example, by Trump‚Äôs difficulty in stating what his policy on abortion access would be. Most Trump voters he knows don‚Äôt care if they only agree with ‚Äútwo in 10 things‚Äù that Trump says, according to DeBoyer. They just want a change. He described his family‚Äôs finances to explain why. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a bunch of debt. I have a mortgage and a couple of car payments. I don‚Äôt have a pension; I have to save in a 401k like everyone else. It‚Äôs impossible for me to save enough money to pay for my kids to go to college.‚Äù He has a 13-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter, who is applying to Duke. ‚ÄúMathematically impossible. I live in a $125,000 house, I drive a Dodge pick-up truck and a Jeep, I don‚Äôt have any credit card debt. None of that. And it‚Äôs mathematically impossible for me to save enough for retirement and enough to send my kids to college. Household income of $100,000, with no debt. Do you understand how a person in my exact financial category gets sucked into that world, between those two? If I tend to lean to the left, I‚Äôm all in with Bernie Sanders. If I tend to lean right, I‚Äôm all in with Donald Trump. Frankly, even if he‚Äôs wrong, what he‚Äôs saying are the only options I have, the only hope I got.‚Äù Leaving Johnnie Lega‚Äôs to head into Algonac proper, you pass by the taxidermy store of Paul Burczycki‚Äîa Trump supporter with qualms. He is angry with the government not least because his insurance payments went up with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs a tough guy to vote for,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a loose cannon. Maybe that‚Äôs all part of his master plan.‚Äù Further down the road, on the right, there‚Äôs Peter Beauregard‚Äôs Algonac Harbour Club on the right, a marina and restaurant on the spot of the old Chris-Craft factory.  He‚Äôs a Trump fan, too. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a lifetime Republican who has been disenchanted like, I guess, a lot of people in our town, so I‚Äôm definitely for the outsider,‚Äù Beauregard said, ‚Äúand I‚Äôve upset several of my local colleagues who are Republicans. If you‚Äôre a Republican you either love him or you hate him. There‚Äôs nobody on the fence.‚Äù Life here revolves around the water. Almost as many driveways are graced by boats as cars. Garfield Wood, a pioneering boat builder and racer who once lived in Algonac, broke the water speed record in 1932, tearing along the St. Clair in a boat powered by airplane engines at 124.86 miles per hour. Chris-Craft made a landing craft used by the U.S. military in the D-Day invasion at Normandy, as well as mahogany-hulled powerboats that are still cherished by nostalgic collectors. The Michigan Senate is contemplating a bill that would recognize Clay Township, Algonac‚Äôs neighbor, as ‚Äúthe sturgeon angling capital‚Äù of the state, and some residents think it will sail through committee. It‚Äôs beautiful in the summer, residents say, with people boating in the sunshine and the restaurants busy with seasonal visitors. Nevertheless, multiple residents liked to efface the town using the same little shorthand list, as if they‚Äôd all memorized it from the same source: Algonac? It‚Äôs three dollar stores, one grocery store, three pharmacies, and that‚Äôs about it. About 97 percent of the residents are white, according to the last census, compared to 74 percent for the United States as a whole. Both Trump and Sanders have found their most reliable support among those in this racial group. It is only after several days in Algonac, at the annual American Indian Festival at the local high school, that I find someone willing to say she is a Clinton supporter, if in a limited sense. Ringed by chairs in the school gym, dancers moved to throbbing drums; fox furs, tribal jewelry and dreamcatchers were for sale at stalls around the gym‚Äôs edge, many run by members of tribes from Walpole Island, just across the Canadian border. Susan Wrobel, the festival‚Äôs organizer and a lifelong Algonac resident, runs a weekly community meeting where she teaches children Anishinaabemowin, the language of her Ojibwe tribe. She said elders there have been ‚Äúshaking their heads‚Äù in wonder and fear that Trump could become president. ‚ÄúI was very pleased whether it was Hillary or Bernie, I actually I like them both,‚Äù she said. She had just bought some new earrings, which danced as she spoke. ‚ÄúSo I chose the Republican ticket to vote for my favorite Republican, and that was Kasich. I love Kasich. He‚Äôs the only one that talked about doing something about the national debt, and I loved that. So I thought, well, the Democratic ticket‚Äôs taken care of for me.‚Äù Michigan‚Äôs primaries are open to all voters regardless of party affiliation, and strategic voting is common. A few days after this conversation, John Kasich, the Ohio governor, would drop out of the race. Once again, it was time for the Algonac-Clay Historical Society‚Äôs monthly meeting. Some of the women at the society are particularly interested in the Victorian era and were making final arrangements for a forthcoming talk on Victorian hair fashions. ‚ÄúHats and tea cups are encouraged,‚Äù noted the flyer. Trump struck them as unnecessarily crude. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the name calling,‚Äù said Marilynn Genaw, who was in charge of ordering the strawberries they‚Äôd need for the tea. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good manners not to say something derogatory about an individual.‚Äù She was still deciding on how to vote. Joan Bulley, a former Algonac bank teller and the town‚Äôs de facto historian-in-residence, could also do without Trump‚Äôs brusqueness, but wonders if it points to an underlying virtue. ‚ÄúOne thing about Donald Trump is he tells it as it is,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care for his rudeness, his insults, but he gets things done.‚Äù Sanders, she said, is at least ‚Äúa little bit more dignified‚Äù in his speeches.  She dislikes Clinton. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt tell the truth. I don‚Äôt like that.‚Äù Bulley‚Äôs grievance with the federal government is that she has never quite forgiven it for transforming the city‚Äôs waterfront under the ‚Äúurban renewal‚Äù push of the 1960s and 1970s. ‚ÄúUrban renewal demolished our town‚Äù she said. She pointed to an exhibit in the society‚Äôs museum, a little hand-drawn map of the businesses that used to line a walkable, 19th-century main street on the riverfront: Koch‚Äôs Jewelry Store, the Starlight Dance Pavilion, the Algonac Theatre. For the most part, those buildings were demolished and replaced with a pleasant, if quiet, boardwalk backed by tidy lawns, and, on the other side, the sort of boxy, parking-lot-fringed architecture that lures chain stores and franchise restaurants. She kept pointing at the exhibits. ‚ÄúThis was Henry‚Äôs on the corner,‚Äù she said, referring to one of her favorite restaurants. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now a parking lot, which is stupid. If they would have saved some of these stores we would at least have something to attract people.‚Äù As the historical society meeting breaks up for homemade snacks and cake, I meet Bud Zeigler, 85, who spent 12 years sanding down Chris-Craft powerboats on the assembly line until the factory moved to Florida, taking some of his colleagues with it. Soon after, he ended up as a carpenter making Pontiacs at General Motors down the road, working there for 30 years until retirement. His complaint about the government is that it‚Äôs always the same old faces in charge, who never seem to get things done. ‚ÄúI voted for Bernie Sanders,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just wanted to break it up a little bit. Because everybody figures this one is favored, that one is favored, well, give the other guy a chance.‚Äù He chuckles a bit at this. ‚ÄúSomewhere along the line you‚Äôve got to get somebody in there that maybe can change things a bit with a new thought in their head, without having the same ones always running for office, families running, you know?‚Äù Even in late April, there was little doubt that it‚Äôd be Clinton versus Trump come November. Trump thinks he can flip Michigan, a state that has reliably gone with theDemocratic presidential candidate for years, to support him. At the Schoolhouse Grille, a buzzing restaurant on Harsens Island, two women stepped outside at the end of the Saturday night dinner rush. Sheltering from the drizzle in an outdoor bar area, the two friends discussed how they would approach the polling booths in November. Kristin Bane, who owns the restaurant and was seeking to escape the kitchen‚Äôs heat, is a Democrat who voted for Sanders. She likes Obama not least because she also spent part of her childhood in Hawaii, opposes fracking and thinks the government should spend more on education. Nancy Bryson, who came out for a smoke and whose family runs the island‚Äôs ferry service to the mainland, most admires the two presidents Bush. ‚ÄúI enjoy listening to Bernie,‚Äù Bryson said. ‚ÄúI do. And I think that there are so many things that he‚Äôs saying that I‚Äôm, ‚ÄòYou know what? I agree with you wholeheartedly. But I don‚Äôt want the government to tell me that I have to do that. I don‚Äôt want to be taxed to do that.‚Äô‚Äù Bryson argued that Trump would help bring the country back to its founding principle. Bane was unconvinced. ‚ÄúHow can we vote for a man who‚Äôs proposing to build a wall that we have spent so many years breaking down in other countries?‚Äù Bane said as Bryson lit a cigarette.  ‚ÄúMy grandfathers and my uncles have died because they were trying to break down walls in other countries so that we could live free‚Äîand we want to build one? That‚Äôs the wrong message.‚Äù ‚ÄúOK, I disagree with you there but I love you,‚Äù Bryson replied. Her mother was an immigrant, she explained, arriving at Ellis Island from Copenhagen as a 12-year-old girl. The barriers to immigration are higher than they were in the Ellis Island era, but Bryson said there was still no good reason to immigrate to the United States through anything but the legal channels.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been wanting to have this conversation for a long time,‚Äù Bane said, without backing down on her point. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good that we can do this and not get angry and stomp our feet about it.‚Äù They found common ground in their dislike for Clinton. ‚ÄúAnd Benghazi?‚Äù Bryson said. ‚ÄúI mean it‚Äôs just unforgivable what happened there.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs a professional liar,‚Äù Bane said.‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù Still, for Bane, the idea of having to vote for someone other than Sanders in November left her anguished. ‚ÄúI could say, ‚ÄòOh, you know, change, yes change, I want change, and so Trump is the quickest way to a change in government.‚Äô I could tell myself that hopefully it‚Äôs going to work out for the best. But I can‚Äôt get past some of these issues like the wall, and I can‚Äôt get past some of these issues like abortion. ‚ÄòA woman should go to jail.‚Äô What the fuck?‚Äù It became apparent that Bryson was not aware that Trump has said he now opposes abortions. This new information was absorbed quickly.  ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs going anti?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWell you know what, here‚Äôs the bottom line, he‚Äôs just trying to buy the Christian base.‚Äù Neither was surprised at how well Sanders and Trump had done in Michigan.‚ÄùThe common ground with them is change,‚Äù Bane said. ‚ÄúAnti-establishment,‚Äù Bryson said. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how I feel,‚Äù Bane said, in a sort of closing statement. ‚ÄùI would hope that Bernie would get in at least to in to run against Trump. I have no time for Hillary Clinton. And when it comes down to it I more than likely will not vote for her. And if it comes down to her and Trump, even though I cringe and I think what‚Äôs going to happen, I at least will have some hope of some kind of change. Something‚Äôs going to shift if he gets in there. Something‚Äôs got to give. And at least there would be that hope still attached to him. With her, I almost fear her. I think she‚Äôs a dangerous woman. I think she‚Äôs an extremely dangerous woman.‚Äù Again, she worried about Trump‚Äôs wall and his position on abortion. ‚ÄúA painful change is still change.‚ÄùThe two women smiled at each other and hugged and then hurried through the drizzle back into the restaurant. Fox and his parents were approaching November with less trepidation. After attending the Trump and Sanders rallies in quick succession, he made up his mind and informed his parents, who were similarly torn between the two, of his decision. Fox thinks women should be allowed to have abortions and that same-sex couples should be able to marry, views he attributes to his age, and here he felt he parted company with Trump. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find anything with Bernie I disagree about. At all. And that‚Äôs the reason. As simple as it gets.‚Äù Also, he said, ‚Äúit seemed like Trump didn‚Äôt need my help,‚Äù he said, which was part of his father‚Äôs thinking, too. They would vote for Trump in November instead. Fox‚Äôs mother, Tracy, came in from work and sat down in an armchair opposite her sons; her husband moved to sit at the floor by her feet. The family talked politics for another hour as the room darkened, illuminated only by a muted CNN flashing on the television. ‚ÄúBoth of my guys won,‚Äù Fox said with satisfaction, ‚Äúso that‚Äôs cool.‚Äù This report first appeared in ‚ÄúThe American Voter,‚Äù Reuters‚Äô special election issue.

Trump backs off ISIS comments; party head appears at rallies in show of unity,"ALTOONA, Pa. (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Friday backed away from comments calling President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton the founders of the militant group Islamic State, while the Republican Party sought to project unity behind their candidate.      A new poll showed Trump, whose unfiltered speaking style has repeatedly landed him in hot water, losing ground in three crucial states ahead of the Nov. 8 general election against Clinton. In a surprise appearance, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who in private expressed fury over some of Trump‚Äôs actions earlier this month, introduced the candidate at a campaign event in Erie, Pennsylvania, and the two hugged onstage. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so honored to be working with Donald Trump and the campaign,‚Äù Priebus told thousands of Trump supporters. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt believe the garbage you read. Let me tell you something. Donald Trump, the Republican Party, all of you, we‚Äôre going to put him in the White House and save this country together.‚Äù Republican sources earlier this month said Priebus was furious over Trump‚Äôs failure to endorse House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and his feud with the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. Trump did endorse Ryan a few days later. Trump brought Priebus on stage later at another rally, in Altoona, Pennsylvania, to thank him for the work he has done as he insisted there is great unity in the party. ‚ÄúI have to say we have great unification,‚Äù Trump said. Trump on Friday told the rallies in Altoona and Erie that his remarks earlier this week calling Obama and Clinton the founders of ISIS, as Islamic State is also known, had been sarcastic. ‚ÄúI have been saying because it‚Äôs true, but somewhat sarcastically, that he‚Äôs the founder of ISIS and she‚Äôs a close second,‚Äù Trump said in Altoona. Trump first made the unfounded claim on Wednesday and repeated it through the week. Trump claimed sarcasm in July as well after he was heavily criticized for inviting Russia to dig up tens of thousands of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù emails from Clinton‚Äôs time as U.S. secretary of state. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released on Friday suggested support for Trump is eroding among voters in three battleground states. Such states are hotly contested because their populations can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and thus play a decisive role in presidential elections, which are ultimately decided by the state-by-state tally of the Electoral College. The poll found Clinton widening her lead in Colorado, Virginia and North Carolina, while holding her advantage in Florida.  Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, painting the move as a sign of transparency that her campaign says Trump lacks. U.S. presidential candidates are not required to release their tax returns, but it has become a common custom. Trump has cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service in refusing to release his returns. Trump also has said his taxes are no one‚Äôs business and that they reveal little. Trump scheduled a speech in Warren, Ohio, on Monday that will focus on how he would handle the threat posed by Islamic State. Trump has said he would ‚Äúknock the hell out of ISIS,‚Äù without offering details. Trump has been mired in repeated controversies in recent days. He drew heavy criticism after he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her. Nearly one-fifth of registered Republicans now want Trump to drop out of the race for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday. Republicans frequently trace the birth of Islamic State to the Obama administration‚Äôs decision to withdraw the last U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of 2011. But many analysts argue its roots lie in the decision of George W. Bush‚Äôs Republican administration to invade Iraq in 2003 without a plan to fill the vacuum created by Saddam Hussein‚Äôs ouster. It was Bush‚Äôs administration that negotiated the 2009 agreement that called for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011. At his Erie event, Trump seemed to acknowledge he is facing a formidable opponent in Clinton as well as a difficult electoral path. ‚ÄúThe Republicans have a tougher path ‚Äì not my fault,‚Äù he said. He said Clinton‚Äôs campaign is smart to keep her out of the spotlight. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt talk to reporters very often. ... She doesn‚Äôt expose what‚Äôs going on up here, which isn‚Äôt good,‚Äù he said, meaning her brain. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt expose her mind to questions. What they want to do is try to fake it through.‚Äù Trump also said in Altoona that the only way he could lose Pennsylvania to Clinton is if ‚Äúcheating goes on.‚Äù He said he wants authorities to monitor the voting closely. ‚ÄúI know what‚Äôs happening here, folks. She can‚Äôt beat what‚Äôs happening here.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 "
U.S. Democrat Pelosi gets 'obscene and sick' calls after hack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Saturday she has been flooded with ‚Äúobscene and sick‚Äù calls and text messages after a hacker linked to Russia posted personal contact information online for her and hundreds of other Democratic lawmakers and aides. Pelosi sent a letter to colleagues warning them to take precautions and said she was changing her phone number after a hacker identified as ‚ÄúGuccifer 2.0‚Äù posted the personal cellphone numbers and email addresses on Friday.  The posted information appeared to have been gained in the electronic breach of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fundraising and campaign arm of Democrats in the House of Representatives. Other Democratic campaign groups, including the Democratic National Committee, also were targeted by the cyber attack, which was made public late last month. ‚ÄúOn a personal note, I was in the air flying from Florida to California when the news broke. Upon landing, I have received scores of mostly obscene and sick calls, voicemails and text messages,‚Äù Pelosi told her colleagues, urging them to keep their phones and incoming text messages away from their family members and children. ‚ÄúThis is a sad course of events, not only for us, but more importantly for our country,‚Äù said Pelosi, who earlier in the week blamed Russia for the cyber attack and called it an ‚Äúelectronic Watergate‚Äù akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters that ultimately brought down Republican President Richard Nixon. John Ramsey, the House‚Äôs chief information security officer, sent a memo to lawmakers and aides whose information had been made public urging them to change passwords for all their accounts and to consider changing their non-House email addresses. He said the hacker had uploaded a spreadsheet with a mix of House and personal email addresses and cellphone numbers for ‚Äúnearly every‚Äù House Democrat and ‚Äúan assorted number of Republicans,‚Äù and similar information for hundreds of staffers. ‚ÄúAlong with the Excel file, ‚ÄòGuccifer 2.0‚Äô uploaded documents that included the account names and passwords for an assortment of subscription services used by the DCCC. Initial analysis identifies some members‚Äô home addresses, along with their spouse‚Äôs name, marital status, and religion,‚Äù the memo said. U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Guccifer 2.0 is an individual or group operating with or for the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. Russia has denied involvement in the breach. The potential Russian involvement in the cyber attack has ignited a fierce campaign debate, with Democrats accusing the Russians of trying to aid Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. But U.S. officials suspect the operation and others directed at the DNC and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign were more likely an attempt to pursue email chains into classified networks or in search of national security policy information than to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. election. ‚ÄúThe Russian assumption probably is that it doesn‚Äôt matter much who wins the election, because Wall Street and other powerful lobbies really run the country,‚Äù one of the officials said on Saturday, speaking like the others on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. ‚ÄúThe old Soviet belief hasn‚Äôt faded completely when it comes to foreign policy,‚Äù the official said.

"Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent. In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department. Clinton‚Äôs running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns. They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency,‚Äù Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement. ‚ÄúIn stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.‚Äù It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.  Clinton‚Äôs tax returns have been made public, in some form, every year since 1977. Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns. Trump also has said his taxes are no one‚Äôs business and that they reveal little. ‚ÄúYour move,‚Äù Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee‚Äôs returns. The Trump campaign dismissed Clinton‚Äôs action, saying in a statement: ‚ÄúThis document release is nothing more than an attempt at distraction and misdirection‚Äù from controversy about her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. On Thursday, Trump‚Äôs special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete. Trump‚Äôs critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.     Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes. On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan. ‚ÄúHe refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns,‚Äù she told the crowd. Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case. Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election. Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent. President Barack Obama also backs the proposal. At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns. Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is ‚Äúafraid‚Äù not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.  Clinton‚Äôs campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007. The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent. The Clintons‚Äô 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages. Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000. ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 "
"Liz Cheney's Wyoming campaign backed by big names, bigger money","CODY, Wyo. (Reuters) - Former Vice President Dick Cheney‚Äôs eldest daughter, bouncing back from an aborted 2014 U.S. Senate bid, heads into a crowded primary race next week for Wyoming‚Äôs lone seat in the House of Representatives buoyed by big-name Republicans and wealthy out-of-state donors. Liz Cheney, the apparent Republican front-runner, has commanded a level of fund-raising and A-list party support - including two former presidents and onetime Cabinet members - that is rare, if not unheard of, for a relative newcomer to Wyoming politics. Her strength is even more significant in a solidly red state where the Republican primary winner is virtually assured victory in the general election. ‚ÄúShe can go to Chicago or New York, and in one fund-raiser pull in more money than the next two closest candidates combined,‚Äù said Deb Oakley Simpson, a daughter-in-law of former longtime Wyoming Republican Senator Alan Simpson and a Cody-based civic activist who backs one of Cheney‚Äôs primary foes, state Senator Leland Christensen. To date, Cheney, 49, has received individual donations totaling more than $1.1 million, far outpacing the collective campaign receipts of her seven Republican opponents and the two Democrats running in Wyoming‚Äôs primary elections on Tuesday. According to the latest opinion poll on the race, conducted during the second week of July, more than half of Wyoming voters were undecided, but Cheney led with 21 percent, more than twice the following of her nearest competitor. Her standing marks a striking turnaround from her first bid for public office, when she returned to her home state three years ago to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was branded by some fellow Republicans as a ‚Äúcarpetbagger‚Äù backed by deep-pocketed outsiders. Her campaign also suffered from a public feud with her sister Mary Cheney, a lesbian, over Liz Cheney‚Äôs opposition to same-sex marriage.  She ended up withdrawing from that race several months later, citing a family health crisis. Cheney and her husband, Phil Perry, an attorney, have five children. Now Cheney, also a lawyer who worked in the State Department while her father was vice president, is leveraging her Washington connections as she runs for the open, at-large House seat in the nation‚Äôs least populous state. Campaigning as a ‚Äústrong conservative voice for Wyoming,‚Äù she has vowed to protect the state‚Äôs pivotal coal industry, defend gun rights and generally work ‚Äúto reverse President Obama‚Äôs devastating policies.‚Äù Among her contributors are a prominent group of her father‚Äôs former high-ranking government colleagues, including former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as former Secretary of State James Baker, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and former White House political adviser Karl Rove. Other prominent donors include New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Colorado oil and entertainment magnate Philip Anschutz, brewing executive Pete Coors, Texas financier T. Boone Pickens, and Chicago real estate and media investor Sam Zell. Cheney‚Äôs two closest Republican primary rivals are state Representative Tim Stubson and Christensen, who rank second and third, respectively, in fund-raising and in polls.  They have raised $255,000 combined in individual donations. Cheney, who was on the campaign trail and unavailable for comment, has accepted no political action committee funds, and PAC funding has figured little in the race. She raised the bulk of her campaign money by the end of March, with nearly half of individual contributions meeting the $2,700 limit set by federal election laws. Most came from outside Wyoming. Still, Cheney ‚Äúhas raised more money from more Wyoming donors than any of her opponents,‚Äù and contributions from all 50 states, campaign manager Bill Novotny said.  ‚ÄúA national effort is what it‚Äôs going to take to stand up to Hillary Clinton‚Äù at the top of the Democratic ticket in November, he added.

"Clinton happily yields national spotlight to Trump, avoids its glare","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If you haven‚Äôt heard a lot about what Hillary Clinton thinks of a string of controversial comments by Donald Trump that have generated round-the-clock coverage on cable news broadcasts, there is a reason ‚Äì it‚Äôs by design. Since becoming the Democratic nominee last month, Clinton has been touring toy manufacturers, visiting tie makers and dropping in on public health clinics, where if she mentions Trump at all, it is usually to contrast their policies. Her swift condemnation at a Wednesday campaign rally of Trump‚Äôs remark that gun rights activists could stop her from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices was a rare instance where she has directly engaged her Republican rival in the 2016 race for the White House. Aides say Clinton‚Äôs strategy is simple: let Trump be Trump. Trump has suffered a series of missteps over the past two weeks that go beyond his remarks on gun rights activists, which he later accused the media of deliberately misinterpreting. He has tangled with party leaders, clashed with the parents of a fallen Muslim American Army captain and this week accused Clinton, a former secretary of state, and President Barack Obama of ‚Äúfounding‚Äù the Islamic State militant group. On Friday, he said he was just being sarcastic when he made that remark.  ‚ÄúThere is an adage in politics:  Don‚Äôt get in the way of a train wreck,‚Äù said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, a top campaign aide to presidential candidates Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. Clinton‚Äôs advisers say they see little benefit in her going toe-to-toe with Trump over every personal accusation, generating sound bites that would dominate cable news broadcasts. Rather, they are happy for him to be embroiled in controversy while Clinton focuses on policy. Trump‚Äôs campaign declined to comment for this story, but the New York real estate developer has accused the national media of bias toward Clinton. He re-posted a supporter‚Äôs Tweet on Friday that said the ‚Äúcorrupt media‚Äù was deliberately exaggerating his remarks to favor his Democratic opponent.  Trump has slipped in opinion polls, and worried Republican Party leaders have urged him to stop making off-the-cuff inflammatory statements that generate blanket, often negative, media coverage and distract from efforts to highlight what they see as Clinton‚Äôs many shortcomings. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sucking all the oxygen out of the room to his own detriment,‚Äù said Republican strategist and Trump supporter Ford O‚ÄôConnell. It‚Äôs not enough to dominate media coverage, he needs to ‚Äúwin‚Äù it, O‚ÄôConnell said. Trump has boasted that the news coverage he generates means he does not have to spend as much on campaign ads, but political veterans say he is squandering the attention and missing opportunities to win over undecided voters. For example, Trump gave an economic speech on Monday that was meant to help his campaign regain momentum, but it was quickly eclipsed by the fallout over his remarks on gun rights activists. Clinton, meanwhile, has been busy courting local media in must-win states. Her national press pool, which seldom gets to question the candidate, often waits as she conducts interviews with local news outlets. She has granted few recent interviews to national outlets and rarely holds press conferences, a strategy her critics say is calculated to avoid questions about her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state, and the relationship between her family‚Äôs global charity, the Clinton Foundation, and the State Department. Clinton, who has said she is one of the most transparent presidential candidates in history, has acknowledged her use of the private email server was a mistake but said she properly handled all classified information. She has denied any improper links between the foundation and the State Department. In interviews with local outlets, Clinton is more likely to face questions about job creation, public health and raising wages - all parts of her platform that she is keen to discuss. In Florida, a crucial battleground state, Republican lobbyist Gus Corbella says the contrast between the local coverage of Clinton‚Äôs campaign stops there and Trump‚Äôs events has been stark. ‚ÄúClinton‚Äôs campaign seems to have the more disciplined approach,‚Äù Corbella said. ‚ÄúThe rollout that day is on a specific event she‚Äôs attending, a message she‚Äôs trying to deliver. Whereas on the Trump side, it‚Äôs what crazy thing did he say today and the response to that.‚Äù After Clinton‚Äôs visit last week to a tie maker in Colorado, the lead story on the front page of the Denver Post was ‚ÄúClinton pledges millions of jobs.‚Äù Trump also featured on the front page, but in a smaller story about ‚Äúdamage control‚Äù in his troubled campaign.

California lawmaker to float zero emissions vehicle bill,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A California lawmaker next week will introduce a bill requiring 15 percent of all vehicles sold in the state to be emissions-free by 2025, her spokeswoman said on Friday. Assemblywoman Autumn Burke says the legislation is needed to ensure that California‚Äôs current zero emissions vehicle target is met with actual vehicles and not just clean car credits, which environmentalists claim have flooded the market.  ‚ÄúGovernor (Jerry) Brown has set an ambitious goal of 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025, but unless we take action, the state won‚Äôt come close to meeting this goal,‚Äù said Burke, who represents the city of Inglewood in car-centric Los Angeles county.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we need to reform the rules to require that 15 percent of all cars sold in California have zero emissions by 2025. This is about clean cars, not credits,‚Äù she said in a statement to Reuters. The bill will require the California Air Resources Board to adopt a regulation by the end of next year to reach the 15 percent goal.  CARB has for years operated a zero emission vehicles program, which has helped the state achieve its current level of about 200,000 ZEVs on the road. But a complex system of clean car credits, designed to give automakers flexibility in meeting the sales target, has led to a glut of credits, according to experts.  Environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors told CARB at a recent meeting that auto companies may be able to reach the state‚Äôs target by simply submitting credits, and said changes to the program‚Äôs credit system are required. About 4 percent of vehicles sold in California are zero emissions vehicles, which include full battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and plug-in hybrids. The NRDC estimates that under the current rules and credit system, California would  have only 6 percent of all vehicles emission-free by 2025.   ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 "
Clinton leads Trump by five points in White House race: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton led Republican Donald Trump by more than 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday, little changed in weeks as the U.S. presidential campaign wobbles into the heart of summer. Since July 28, Clinton‚Äôs daily support among likely voters in the poll has hovered between a low of 41 and a high of 44 percentage points. She was at 41 percentage points on Thursday, down slightly this week. Trump‚Äôs support has moved slightly more, ranging from a low of 33 percentage points to a high of 39 points. He was at 36 points on Thursday, up slightly this week. Among registered voters, Clinton was ahead by 9 points on Thursday, 42 to 33. At this point in the 2012 election, both President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney had solidified their support, and Romney held a 45 percent to 41 percent lead, with only 14 percent of likely voters not picking one of the two candidates. Trump, a New York businessman seeking his first elected office, has been mired in controversies in recent days, and many establishment Republicans have begun to distance themselves from his campaign. He drew heavy criticism for suggesting gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was meant to rally votes against her. On Thursday he repeatedly accused Clinton and Obama of being co-founders of the Islamic State militant group. On Friday he said the remarks were meant to be sarcasm. On Thursday, the number of likely voters who were not picking either Clinton or Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election was 22 percent. That number has remained stubbornly in the 20- to 25-point range for weeks. Despite that, neither of the alternative candidates is gaining traction. In a four-way race, Libertarian Gary Johnson saw his support dip slightly to 7 percentage points on Thursday, down from a high of nearly 9 points earlier this week. Green Party nominee Jill Stein was at about 3 points on Thursday, largely unchanged. The results on Thursday were taken from a sample of 1,446 registered voters and 1,116 likely voters surveyed between Aug. 7 and Aug. 11. The results have a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 "
Exclusive: Congressional leaders were briefed a year ago on hacking of Democrats - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence officials told top congressional leaders a year ago that Russian hackers were attacking the Democratic Party, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, but the lawmakers were unable to tell the targets about the hacking because the information was so secret. The disclosure of the Top Secret information would have revealed that U.S. intelligence agencies were continuing to monitor the hacking, as well as the sensitive intelligence sources and the methods they were using to do it. The material was marked with additional restrictions and assigned a unique codeword, limiting access to a small number of officials who needed to know that U.S. spy agencies had concluded that two Russian intelligence agencies or their proxies were targeting the Democratic National Committee, the central organizing body of the Democratic Party. The National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies sometimes delay informing targets of foreign intelligence activities under similar circumstances, officials have said. The alleged hacking of the Democrats and the Russian connection did not become public until late last month when the FBI said it was investigating a cyber attack at the DNC. The DNC did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The congressional briefing was given last summer in a secure room called a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, to a group of congressional leaders informally known as the ‚ÄúGang of Eight,‚Äù the sources said. The group at the time included four Republicans: Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, and Senator Richard Burr and Representative Devin Nunes, the House and Senate intelligence committee chairs. Their Democratic counterparts were: Senator Harry Reid and Representative Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff of the intelligence committees. AshLee Strong, press secretary for the current House Speaker, Paul Ryan, declined to comment, and Pelosi‚Äôs office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Pelosi on Thursday called the hacking an ‚Äúelectronic Watergate‚Äù and said the Russians were behind it. DNC officials have said they did not learn about the hacking until months after the initial congressional briefing, when an agent from an FBI cybersecurity squad asked them last fall about the party‚Äôs data security arrangements. Even then, the Democratic sources said, the FBI agent never mentioned that U.S. intelligence officials suspected that Russian hackers were targeting the organization. The attack on the DNC later led the hackers to other party organizations, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises funds for House candidates, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign, and other groups. A DCCC spokeswoman declined to comment. The hackers initially used ‚Äúspearphishing‚Äù - attacks on the private email accounts of dozens of people working for the organizations, several sources said. One of the sources said the Clinton campaign first detected attacks on its data system in early March, and was given what the source described as a ‚Äúgeneral briefing‚Äù about it by the FBI later that month. The source said the FBI made no mention of a Russian connection in that briefing and did not say when the penetration first took place.  According to a memo obtained by Reuters, interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile said on Thursday she was creating a Cybersecurity Advisory Board ‚Äúto ensure prevent future attacks and ensure that the DNC‚Äôs cybersecurity capabilities are best-in-class.‚Äù (This version of the story corrects seventh paragraph to show that John Boehner was House speaker at time of briefing) ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 "
"Republican Party, Trump campaign to meet in Florida","ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign team is to meet officials from the Republican National Committee on Friday in what both groups described as a routine session to discuss joint operations in Florida. Trump, who is lagging Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in opinion polls, was not expected to attend the Orlando gathering after staging a rally near there on Thursday. He is to hold separate events on Friday in Erie and Altoona, Pennsylvania. The New York businessman is struggling to get past a rough several days, when he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her. In recent weeks, a steady stream of moderate Republicans, such as U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine,  have vowed not to support Trump, while 50 Republican national security experts signed a letter opposing him. Many Republicans not only worry about failing to win the White House, but also are alarmed that their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives could be at risk. Trump has blamed the U.S. news media for taking many of his comments out of context, and on Thursday night, some of his supporters heckled and cursed reporters who covered the rally in a large arena in Kissimmee. On Friday, Trump passed off as sarcasm the assertion he made repeatedly this week that President Barack Obama and Clinton were ‚Äúco-founders‚Äù of Islamic State and its Most Valuable Players. ‚ÄúRatings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) ‚Äòthe founder‚Äô of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON‚ÄôT GET SARCASM?‚Äù Trump said in a tweet. It was the second time in recent weeks that Trump has explained a controversial statement as sarcastic. In late July, he invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù emails from Clinton‚Äôs time as U.S. secretary of state, which raised concerns among intelligence experts that he was urging a foreign government to spy on Americans. He said later he was being sarcastic. ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 "
"Trump calls Obama, Clinton Islamic State 'co-founders,' draws rebuke","WASHINGTON/MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump called President Barack Obama and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton the ‚Äúco-founders‚Äù of Islamic State, ratcheting up his assertion that they are responsible for the rise of the militant group and sparking renewed criticism of his leadership ability. Clinton‚Äôs White House campaign on Thursday called the remarks a ‚Äúfalse claim,‚Äù in Clinton‚Äôs latest response to a series of attacks by Trump in which he has sought to portray America as less safe, blaming Democrats and depicting himself as the only one who can restore security. Democrats, in turn, have used Trump‚Äôs often hyperbolic statements ahead of the Nov. 8 election to argue that he is unfit to be president and lacks the temperament to be trusted with matters of national security. ‚ÄúThis is another example of Donald Trump trash-talking the United States,‚Äù Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs remarkable about Trump‚Äôs comments is that once again he‚Äôs echoing the talking points of Putin and our adversaries to attack American leaders and American interests, while failing to offer any serious plans to confront terrorism or make this country more secure,‚Äù Sullivan said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Republicans uncertain about whether Trump has the discipline to maintain focus for his campaign, the latest comments were concerning. Many see the New York real estate mogul as spending too much time fighting within his own party and have called on him to refocus his campaign message on Clinton.  ‚ÄúISIS is a solid GOP message to show contrast with Hillary Clinton and the failures of the Obama-Clinton administration,‚Äù said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist who remains undecided about the nominee, using acronyms for Islamic State and the Republican Party.  Even so, she added, ‚ÄúTrump should have simply said that the Obama administration‚Äôs decision to pull all troops out of Iraq, with no stay-behind agreement, created a vacuum and allowed ISIS to metastasize. It‚Äôs absurd for him to say that Obama and Clinton are founders of ISIS  - and he can‚Äôt blame the media for this.‚Äù A group of about 70 Republicans, including five former members of Congress, called on the Republican National Committee to stop helping Trump in the wake of his recent remarks and instead focus on getting members of Congress re-elected. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs divisive and dangerous actions are not only a threat to our other candidates, but to our party and the nation,‚Äù the letter stated. In response, Trump said he would stop raising money for the Republican Party if it ends its help for his campaign. ‚ÄúIf they want to do that they can save me a lot of time and a lot of energy,‚Äù he told Fox News. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one raising the money for them.‚Äù Some Republicans see a small silver lining in Trump talking more about Clinton. ‚ÄúIt is helpful ‚Äì at least to the rest of the ticket ‚Äì that he is focusing a little more on Clinton than on other Republicans, whether defeated primary opponents or other elected officials who are on the ballot, for a change,‚Äù said former New Hampshire Republican Chairman Fergus Cullen, who is not supporting Trump.  ‚ÄúBut tomorrow, or later today, he could blame (Republican Senator) Jeff Flake for A-Rod‚Äôs retirement,‚Äù Cullen said, referring to Yankees player Alex Rodriguez‚Äôs decision to leave professional baseball. ‚ÄúI have zero confidence in Trump‚Äôs ability to stay on one message or to drive one message for any length of time longer than about 10 seconds.‚Äù     Trump has previously criticized Clinton for supporting the Iraq War in 2003 while she was a U.S. senator. Trump frequently says, to contrast himself with Clinton, that he opposed the war - but in interviews before the invasion he did voice support. Now, Trump is arguing that in trying to end the war and withdrawing U.S. troops in 2011, Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, and Obama created Islamic State.  Republicans frequently trace the birth of Islamic State to the Obama administration‚Äôs decision to withdraw the last U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of 2011.  But many analysts argue its roots lie in the decision of George W. Bush‚Äôs Republican administration to invade Iraq in 2003 without a plan to fill the vacuum created by Saddam Hussein‚Äôs ouster. It was Bush‚Äôs administration, not Obama‚Äôs, that negotiated the 2009 agreement that called for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011. Clinton posted on Twitter that Trump‚Äôs comments are disqualifying. ‚ÄúAnyone willing to sink so low, so often should never be allowed to serve as our commander-in-chief,‚Äù she wrote. The White House declined to comment on Trump‚Äôs claim. Appearing in Miami Beach, Florida, on Thursday morning, Trump repeated his attack for the third time, saying the U.S. government ‚Äúhas unleashed ISIS.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn fact, I think we‚Äôll give Hillary Clinton ... most valuable player,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúISIS will hand her the most valuable player award. Her only competition is President Barack Obama.‚Äù     Trump first made the assertion in a speech on Wednesday night in Florida, saying, ‚ÄúI call them co-founders‚Äù of Islamic State.  In an interview on Thursday morning, Trump defended the remarks. ‚ÄúIs there something wrong with saying that?‚Äù Trump told CNBC. ‚ÄúWhy - are people complaining that I said he was the founder of ISIS? All I do is tell the truth, I‚Äôm a truth teller.‚Äù Trump was also asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt if he ‚Äúmeant that (Obama) created the vacuum, he lost the peace.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Trump responded. ‚ÄúI meant he‚Äôs the founder of ISIS. I do.‚Äù  The Democratic National Committee lambasted Trump‚Äôs remarks. ‚ÄúDonald Trump should apologize for his outrageous, unhinged and patently false suggestions on the founding of ISIS,‚Äù the DNC said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis is yet another out of control statement by a candidate who is unraveling before our very eyes.‚Äù  Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Trump on CNN, saying his remarks were ‚Äúlegitimate political commentary.‚Äù   ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 "
"Clinton disparages Trump's economic plan, vows to help workers","WARREN, Mich. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday said rival Donald Trump had no real plans to help middle-class families, arguing that his agenda of tax cuts and tough trade talk would throw the economy into recession. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs¬†offered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today,‚Äù Clinton said in Warren, Michigan, shortly after touring Futuramic, a hangar-like, high-tech factory that makes parts for the aerospace industry. Clinton said Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, would scrap regulations meant to hold corporations accountable, cut taxes on ‚Äúmillionaires and Wall Street money managers,‚Äù and eliminate the estate tax, an inheritance tax that generally hits the wealthy. Clinton offered no new proposals of her own but sought to cast doubt on the image Trump promotes of himself as the voice for working people. The New York businessman is counting on his appeal to blue-collar voters with concerns about global trade to boost his chances in key states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. Clinton on Thursday ran through many of the policies she has outlined over the last year to contrast herself with Trump, who has given far fewer details about his plans, as the presidential campaign heads toward the Nov. 8 election. Speaking to Fox News later on Thursday, Trump said he would cut business taxes to bring jobs back to the United States, while Clinton would have to double taxes to meet the increased spending on social programs in her plan. Trump delivered an economic speech in Detroit on Monday. He publicly named his economic advisers last week, which Clinton mocked as ‚Äúsix guys named Steve.‚Äù On Thursday, he released a list of nine additions to the council, eight of whom were women. New members included roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks, investor Carla Sands and hedge funder Anthony Scaramucci. Workers‚Äô anxiety over trade deals has become a central theme in the 2016 election, and Clinton rejected the portrait Trump has painted that she only pretends not to favor the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal she praised when she was secretary of state from 2009-2013 but has more recently opposed. Clinton also says she would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by former President Bill Clinton, her husband. Trump routinely disparages the agreement as bad for American jobs.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that too often past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that didn‚Äôt pan out,‚Äù Clinton told the crowd of factory workers. ‚ÄúThe answer is not to rant and rave, or cut ourselves off from the world. ‚ÄúThe answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 "
"Ex-Trump staffer sues campaign, alleges gun incident in North Carolina","(Reuters) - A former North Carolina staffer is suing Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign, saying a top employee in the state working on the Republican‚Äôs White House bid once pulled a gun on him and that after he reported it, the campaign took no action. Vincent Bordini, who said he was hired in December 2015 as a software trainer, said Earl Phillip, then Trump‚Äôs North Carolina state director, pointed a pistol at his kneecap while the two were in a car together in February, according to a lawsuit dated Wednesday and filed in state court. Bordini said he reported the incident to several Trump campaign officials, including then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, with no result, according to the lawsuit, which was posted online by the New York Daily News. The lawsuit names Phillip and the Trump campaign as defendants. ‚ÄúVincent was a passionate Donald J.

Phillip was replaced earlier this month as state director and moved to a diversity coalition for Trump. On Thursday, he resigned from the campaign, Harding said.

Trump adviser joined key party meeting on Ukraine,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A foreign policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump confirmed his attendance at a meeting last month during which the Republican Party agreed to watered-down language in its support of Ukraine. J. D. Gordon, the adviser who previously served as a Pentagon spokesman, said that while he was present during the meeting at the Republican National Convention, he sat at a side table with staff and was not among the delegates charged with shaping the Ukraine platform. But one delegate in attendance, Diana Denman, said Gordon told her he was going to speak with Trump during the debate over the platform‚Äôs language on Ukraine, saying she believed Trump‚Äôs campaign played a direct role in softening the party‚Äôs support for Ukraine at a time of heightened tensions with Russia. The Trump campaign has denied it played any role in the weakening of the party‚Äôs position regarding Ukraine. Gordon called Denman‚Äôs version of events ‚Äúinaccurate.‚Äù  Stephen Yates, co-chair of the national security subcommittee, confirmed that Trump campaign members were present at the meeting where Ukraine language for the RNC platform was discussed. But he said only delegates participated in the debate and denied the Trump campaign played any role in softening the Ukraine language. The details of the meeting in Cleveland have attracted scrutiny and raised questions about the Trump campaign‚Äôs stance toward Russia. Trump has said he would seek to build a closer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, praising him as a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama. In the last month, Trump has also suggested he might not defend NATO allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite Russia to hack the emails of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and suggested he might accept Russia‚Äôs 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Denman, a member of the platform committee‚Äôs national security subcommittee, said she proposed language that supported ‚Äúproviding lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces and greater coordination with NATO on defense planning.‚Äù That phrase was eventually changed to remove the reference to ‚Äúlethal defensive weapons.‚Äù In the end, the platform, which serves as a largely symbolic statement of the party‚Äôs priorities, criticizes the Obama administration for encouraging a ‚Äúresurgent Russia‚Äù and supports continued sanctions on Moscow and ‚Äúappropriate assistance to the armed forces of the Ukraine‚Äù without specifying what that would involve. Yates said Denman could have reintroduced the amendment in the full committee meeting if she felt strong-armed in subcommittee. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have particular sympathy for delegates who chose not to avail themselves of the opportunity in full committee, and then start spinning yarn about how this came about,‚Äù he said. Denman said she stands by her account. Russia on Thursday announced it would conduct war games in the Black Sea, a day after Putin accused Ukraine of trying to provoke a conflict over Crimea.

Trump settles legal dispute with former campaign aide,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign has settled a legal dispute with former aide Sam Nunberg, according to a court document filed in New York on Thursday.

The one-page filing with a New York state court did not give the terms of the settlement. Nunberg‚Äôs attorney, Andrew Miltenberg, said ‚Äúthe matter was amicably resolved‚Äù but he declined to comment further. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the affidavit, Nunberg said the argument was part of a ‚Äúsordid and apparently illicit affair‚Äù between the two. He denied being the source for the New York Post story. Lewandowski was fired by the campaign in June, a move apparently unrelated to the Post story.  A Trump Organization lawyer, Alan Garten, last month called Nunberg‚Äôs allegations ‚Äúcategorically untrue.‚Äù The Trump campaign fired Nunberg in August 2015 after the discovery of Facebook posts that critics deemed racist.

U.S. government shifts $81 million to Zika vaccine research,"CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has shifted $81 million in funds from other projects to continue work on developing vaccines to fight Zika in the absence of any funding from U.S. lawmakers. In a letter addressed to Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and minority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said she was allocating $34 million in funding to the National Institutes of Health and $47 million to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to work on Zika vaccines. Burwell said the funding was intended to keep Zika vaccine research going despite the lack of funding from U.S. lawmakers, who left for summer recess before allocating any funding to Zika research and preparedness. The mosquito-borne Zika virus has spread to more than 50 countries and territories since the outbreak began last year in Brazil. On Thursday, Governor Rick Scott said state health officials have identified three additional people in the affected area with locally transmitted Zika, bringing the total to 25. The Obama administration in February requested $1.9 billion to fight Zika, but congressional lawmakers have been considering a much smaller sum. A bill providing $1.1 billion was blocked by Democrats after Republicans attached language to stop abortion-provider Planned Parenthood from using that government funding for healthcare services, mainly in U.S. territories like Puerto Rico. The Republican legislation also would siphon off unused money under President Barack Obama‚Äôs signature 2010 healthcare law to combat Zika. In addition, Democrats balked at a Republican provision that they said would gut clean water protections. The new bolus of funds from HHS comes on top of the $589 million in repurposed funds previously allocated for Ebola efforts. HHS has said these funds will run out at the end of August. At a press briefing in Washington, Dr. Anthony Fauci,  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he needs $33 million to prepare to move the first potential Zika vaccine to the second phase of human clinical trials. The first phase of that testing is expected to end in late November or December. Fauci said the health secretary has the authority to transfer 1 percent of NIH‚Äôs $33 billion budget per year from one Institute to the other. He said the director of the NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, will decide which existing programs the funds will be drawn from. ‚ÄúHe will probably do it on a prorated basis across the Institutes,‚Äù he said. Fauci said the budget transfer will not fill the longer-term NIH funding needs to fight the virus and to develop a second or third potential vaccine candidate. Drugs frequently fail to realize the promise they show in early trials. ‚ÄúWe still need about $196 million more,‚Äù he said. Fauci said the health secretary‚Äôs action was essentially one of desperation given the failure of Congress to authorize additional funding. Taking money from other research programs ‚Äúis extremely damaging to the biomedical research enterprise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking money away from cancer, diabetes, all those things.‚Äù Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said at the briefing that local health authorities are similarly siphoning off money from other programs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre robbing Peter to pay Paul,‚Äù he said.  In her letter, Burwell said the $47 million in funding for BARDA will allow the agency to enter into contracts with key partners to develop vaccines. But, she said BARDA will need an   estimated $342 million in additional funding to continue its work with outside partners in the development of vaccines, diagnostics and pathogen inactivation technology used to protect the U.S. blood supply.

Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas.  The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak: How do people become infected? Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. How do you treat Zika? There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization (WHO) had said early in 2016 that it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. A vaccine is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. U.S. government researchers said they started their first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at more than 1,700 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation had declined to 3,257. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 54 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected.

Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is ‚Äúrelatively common‚Äù and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. Those cases involved possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. But the CDC issued updated recommendations for preventing and testing for Zika infection on July 25, warning that the virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected female partner. A reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City, and limited human and non-human primate data indicating that Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions, led to the new warning, the agency said. CDC‚Äôs expanded warnings on sexual exposure to Zika now  caution against sex without a condom or other barrier method of protection with any person, male or female, who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika, including female to female transmission with a pregnant partner. British health officials reported Zika was found in a man‚Äôs semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. The WHO has identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue. ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 "

Trump acknowledges tough fight in usually Republican Utah,"ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump acknowledged on Thursday that his campaign was struggling in Utah, a usually rock-solid Republican state, on a day in which he briefly set aside his self-confidence for a rare display of doubt.  Trump made the comment in urging conservative Christian evangelicals to organize support for him in several key states where the Nov. 8 election is likely to be decided, such as Ohio, Florida and Virginia. The wealthy New York businessman has suffered a number of self-inflicted wounds in recent days that have given the advantage in the campaign to Democrat Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having a tremendous problem in Utah,‚Äù Trump told a conference room filled with evangelical pastors, blaming a ‚Äúfalse narrative‚Äù that has been built up around his candidacy. He has repeatedly blamed the news media for dishonest tactics. A SurveyUSA opinion poll conducted for the Salt Lake Tribune in June showed Clinton and Trump tied. Other polls have given Trump a lead but not the type of advantage that previous Republican nominees have enjoyed in the state. The normally confident Trump never apologizes and is loathe to admit that he might face difficulties. But in talking to the National Association of Home Builders earlier in Miami Beach, Trump admitted his past years before he became a politician could be causing him problems now. ‚ÄúIf I had planned for it, I wouldn‚Äôt have had such a rocky path,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have spoken to Howard so much.‚Äù That was a reference to his many appearances on the ‚ÄúHoward Stern Show‚Äù radio program. He has been estimated to have appeared on the show more than two dozen times over 20 years, and the conversation frequently turned ribald.  Trump, who is trailing Clinton in Virginia, a formerly Republican state that Democratic President Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012, urged evangelicals to help him in that state as well. In doing so, Trump pledged to rewrite the so-called Johnson Amendment, the 1954 change in the U.S. tax code that prohibits church leaders from using the pulpit for political purposes. ‚ÄúIf we get those people to vote, we‚Äôre going to win in Virginia,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt vote, it‚Äôs not going to happen.‚Äù Trump also said ‚Äúwe need help in Ohio,‚Äù the state where he held his Republican National Convention last month. Ohio Governor John Kasich, who lost to Trump in the Republican primary race, has refused to endorse Trump. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very close in Ohio, but we need help,‚Äù Trump said. Trump has seen a steady stream of moderate Republicans vow not to support him, such as U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and 50 Republican national security experts signed a letter opposing him.  All this is evidence of fissures in the party over the bellicose rhetoric and positions of Trump, who on Wednesday called Obama ‚Äúthe founder of ISIS,‚Äù the acronym for Islamic State, and Clinton ‚Äúthe co-founder.‚Äù Trump joked that winning the White House and doing a good job as president might be his only way to salvation. ‚ÄúSo go out and spread the words and once I get in, I will do the thing that I do very well,‚Äù said Trump with a smile. ‚ÄúI figure it‚Äôs probably maybe the only way I‚Äôm going to get to heaven, so I better do a good job.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 "
Clinton would stick with Garland as nominee for Supreme Court: Reid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Thursday he believed Hillary Clinton would stick with President Barack Obama‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee if she won the Nov. 8 presidential election. Some Republican conservatives were concerned that if Democratic presidential candidate Clinton won the White House, she would pick a more liberal judge than Obama‚Äôs nominee,  Merrick Garland, for a lifetime appointment to the high court. Garland is a centrist federal appeals court judge whom a number of Republicans have praised. ‚ÄúI would think that she and all the people around her would say, ‚ÄòWhy do we need to rock the boat here? Let‚Äôs get him confirmed quickly and move on to the next one, whenever that comes,‚Äô‚Äù Reid said on a conference call with reporters. Clinton has urged the Senate to confirm Garland. Her  campaign did not immediately return a request for comment on Reid‚Äôs remarks. Senate Democrats may try to force a vote on procedural motions that, if successful, would lead to a vote on Garland before the new president takes office in January, Reid said. He invited along Republicans who want to distance themselves from their party‚Äôs controversial presidential candidate, Donald Trump. ‚ÄúWe have a couple of options and we are deciding when to do that. And if we should do that. When and if,‚Äù Reid said. The leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, Mitch McConnell, has refused to schedule hearings on the nomination of Garland, saying the winner of the Nov. 8 presidential election should choose the Supreme Court justice. Obama nominated Garland on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. ‚ÄúThe majority leader has been clear: the next president will make the nomination for this vacancy,‚Äù Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff for McConnell, said in an email. A number of Republican senators in tough re-election fights are trying to distance themselves from their party‚Äôs controversial nominee, yet they refuse to hold a vote on Garland, Reid said.  He said those Republicans should call on McConnell to confirm Garland, not hold the Supreme Court seat for someone as ‚Äúradical and unfit‚Äù as Trump, a New York businessman who has never held public office. ‚ÄúThey spend a lot of time these Republicans, spending a lot of energy trying to separate themselves from Donald Trump. But as long as they‚Äôre holding a Supreme Court seat open for him, they‚Äôre his minions. They‚Äôre his enablers,‚Äù Reid said.   ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 "
"Clinton to release 2015 tax returns within days, criticizes Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will release her 2015 tax returns and her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, will release the last 10 years of their tax returns within days, according to a source close to Clinton. The returns will show Clinton paid an effective tax rate of 35 percent and gave about 10 percent to charity, CNBC reported. The release comes as Republican Donald Trump is facing criticism for not releasing his tax returns - a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every White House nominee since 1973. ‚ÄúHe refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns,‚Äù Clinton said on Thursday in an economic speech in Michigan.   Clinton‚Äôs campaign has already released tax returns going back to 2007. In addition, tax returns are publicly available for the eight years her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was in the White House. Prior years were released by his campaign. Tax returns filed by the Clintons have been made public, in some form, for every year back to 1977. Trump, a New York businessman, has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. He has said he is unlikely to do so before the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have blasted Trump for failing to disclose his tax rate and raised questions about what his returns say about his net worth and various business ties, particularly in Russia.     Asked in a television interview in May what tax rate he pays, Trump replied ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs none of your business.‚Äù The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. Besides showing sources and amounts of income, tax returns show what percentage tax rate a person ultimately pays, as well as how much they claimed in deductions and the amounts given to charities.   Earlier this month, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to make his returns public. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election,‚Äù Buffett said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions.‚Äù Trump has declined to do so.

U.S. House Democrats' Pelosi: administration may shift funds for Zika,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the Obama administration may announce as early as Thursday that it is shifting more money into fighting the Zika virus. ‚ÄúMaybe today or tomorrow,‚Äù Pelosi told reporters in a hallway on Thursday. She did not give an amount, but said, ‚ÄúI think they are going to try to do it a piece at a time, hoping that something else will happen,‚Äù an apparent reference to the administration‚Äôs request that the Republican-led Congress approve a funding bill to combat the virus. The Obama administration in February requested $1.9 billion to fight the virus, which was first detected in Brazil last year and has spread rapidly in the Americas. Before going home on summer recess, lawmakers were discussing a $1.1 billion measure, but the bill stalled amid partisan bickering. House Democrats at a news conference urged the Republicans to reconvene Congress to address the virus. Florida is grappling with at least 21 cases of locally transmitted Zika, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million to fight the virus. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will spend all of its remaining funds by the end of September, while two other agencies will exhaust their resources for Zika by the end of August, Representative Rosa DeLauro said. Money will have to be shifted from biomedical research to fight Zika, DeLauro said. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt, vaccine development will be stopped dead in its tracks,‚Äù she said.

Pelosi called the attack, made public last month, an ‚Äúelectronic Watergate‚Äù akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office that upended the Nixon presidency. ‚ÄúThis is a break-in.‚Äù Pelosi‚Äôs comments come on the heels of a New York Times report on Thursday that the cyber attack targeting Democrats was wider than first thought, with more than 100 party officials and groups were affected. The Democratic National Committee and U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign was also affected. Asked if she was personally targeted, Pelosi said she did not know. ‚ÄúWe are assessing the damage,‚Äù Pelosi told reporters, adding that she could not speak to the impact on any Democratic governors. The Obama administration has not publicly named Russia as behind the attack, but investigators have concluded the attackers were directed by the GRU, Russia‚Äôs military intelligence service, and the FSB, the civilian espionage agency. Clinton has also pointed to Moscow. Russia has denied involvement in the breach. A U.S. official familiar with the investigation said no evidence has been found so far that indicates the hackers got into Clinton‚Äôs personal server or any classified systems, but their footprints suggest they ‚Äúpaid special attention to accounts they thought might lead them to information of national security interest.‚Äù The official said the hackers apparently proceeded beyond the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton campaign, and the Democrats‚Äô House of Representatives campaign committee to individual email accounts and probably other Democratic groups and individuals who emailed people using the accounts they first hacked. ‚ÄúThe pattern fits what has come to be standard hacking practice,‚Äù said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation by government as well as private agencies. ‚ÄúYou go as far as you can, hoping you find something useful.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 "
"Clinton blasts Trump for 'casual inciting of violence,' Republicans shaken","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Wednesday accused Republican opponent Donald Trump of inciting violence with his call for gun rights activists to stop her from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices. Clinton‚Äôs comments added to a growing outcry over Trump‚Äôs remarks on Tuesday at a North Carolina rally, which some interpreted as a call for violence against his White House rival. His remarks also fueled widespread concerns about his ability to stay on track. ‚ÄúWords matter, my friends,‚Äù the former U.S. secretary of state, who rarely engages in direct back-and-forths with her Republican rival, said at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa. ‚ÄúAnd if you are running to be president or you are president of the United States, words can have tremendous consequences.‚Äù ‚ÄúYesterday, we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that crossed the line,‚Äù she said, citing ‚Äúhis casual inciting of violence.‚Äù Trump insisted in an interview with Fox News that his remarks were a call for political, not physical, action. ‚ÄúThere is tremendous political power to save the Second Amendment, tremendous,‚Äù the New York businessman said. ‚ÄúAnd you look at the power they have in terms of votes and that‚Äôs what I was referring to, obviously that‚Äôs what I was referring to, and everybody knows it.‚Äù The U.S. Constitution‚Äôs Second Amendment guarantees a right to keep and bear arms. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of anything remotely comparable to it. No one tells a joke about the opponent getting shot. I‚Äôve never heard it,‚Äù said Bob Shrum, a top aide for Al Gore‚Äôs presidential campaign in 2000 and John Kerry‚Äôs in 2004. High-profile Republicans and rank-and-file voters appeared shaken on Wednesday after a string of Trump misfires, struggling with how to best reject his divisive candidacy. Some pledged to withhold their endorsement and others backed Clinton.  Some, including MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, called for party leaders to replace Trump on the ticket. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Aug. 5-8 - before Trump‚Äôs latest controversy - showed that nearly one-fifth of 396 registered Republicans said they want Trump to drop out of the race and another 10 percent said they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know‚Äù whether the Republican nominee should or not. Clinton‚Äôs campaign, seeing an opening, has moved to bring disenchanted Republicans into the fold by announcing an official intraparty outreach effort on behalf of the Democratic nominee. Clinton‚Äôs campaign now has a website for Republicans and political independents to sign up to pledge their support, listing 50 prominent Republicans and independents who have endorsed her. On Monday, 50 Republican national security officials signed an open letter questioning Trump‚Äôs temperament, calling him reckless and unqualified to be president.     Other top Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine this week, have disavowed Trump but said they cannot back Clinton. James Rohrscheib, 74, a registered Republican and retired U.S. Navy officer from Washington state, told Reuters the reality is the Nov. 8 election will be a ‚Äútough one.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a quandary as to who I am going to vote for,‚Äù Rohrscheib said. Trump has dismissed the defections and criticism as an unsurprising reaction of the so-called Washington elite to his drive to change the status quo. One group that appears unswayed is Trump‚Äôs donors. Reuters interviewed nine major Trump donors on Wednesday, and not one said his Second Amendment comment had given them pause. Trump Texas fundraising co-chair Gaylord Hughey called the interpretation of his remark as condoning violence ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù and ‚Äúludicrous.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just another issue the press has really twisted to make headlines,‚Äù Hughey said. But Mike Smith, a Republican voter and Reuters/Ipsos poll respondent, said the support Trump is still receiving from Republicans ‚Äúalmost seems obligatory rather than voluntary.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm almost at the point where I think I‚Äôm going to vote for Hillary. I don‚Äôt like her,‚Äù said Smith, a 74-year-old retiree who lives in Clearwater, Florida. ‚ÄúBut Mr. Trump is making me very nervous.‚Äù Republican strategist and Trump supporter Ford O‚ÄôConnell said Trump has ‚Äúdug himself a deep hole‚Äù with voters and to win the election he will need to ‚Äúmake it a referendum on Hillary Clinton and the ‚Äòrigged system.‚Äô‚Äù Trump sought to do just that by using an economic policy speech in Detroit on Monday to correct a series of missteps that included a prolonged clash with the parents of a fallen Muslim American soldier. But his remarks Tuesday undermined that effort. ‚ÄúIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,‚Äù Trump said at the rally in North Carolina. ‚ÄúAlthough the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he continued. A federal official familiar with the matter denied a media report that the U.S. Secret Service, which investigates threats against presidents and candidates, had formally spoken with the Trump campaign about his remark. Trump‚Äôs comment and the resulting backlash occurred as Reuters/Ipsos polling showed some 44 percent of 1,162 registered voters believe Trump should exit the race, and that as of Tuesday, Clinton led Trump by more than 7 percentage points, up from a 3-point lead late last week. Strategists and Trump detractors agreed that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to remove Trump from the Republican ticket. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wishful thinking to believe the Republicans are going to replace its nominee after the convention. People are grasping at straws,‚Äù Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist unaffiliated with Trump, told Reuters. A more likely scenario would be a replay of the 1996 presidential race, when the Republican Party essentially deserted nominee Bob Dole, who was badly trailing President Bill Clinton, to focus on congressional races.

Trump seeks to raise fresh ethical questions about Clinton,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday tried to raise ethical questions about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and criticized her for letting the father of the Orlando nightclub shooter sit behind her at a rally. At campaign events in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and earlier in Abingdon, Virginia, Trump sought to rally his campaign after a setback on Tuesday when he appeared to suggest gun rights activists should take action against Clinton. On Wednesday he drew attention to the emergence of emails from Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server when she was secretary of state during President Barack Obama‚Äôs first term, from 2009-2013. A conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, obtained the release through court order of 44 email exchanges that it said were not previously turned over to the State Department. Among them was a 2009 email in which Doug Band, a former official at the Clinton Foundation charity run by former President Bill Clinton, directed two Hillary Clinton aides to put Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and Clinton Foundation donor Gilbert Chagoury in touch with a State Department official dealing with Lebanon. The Clinton campaign has dismissed the new emails as having nothing to do with Clinton or the foundation‚Äôs work. Trump, who is trailing in many polls with three months to go until the Nov. 8 election, said the new batch of emails suggested a ‚Äúpay for play‚Äù scheme. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not allowed to do it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs illegal.‚Äù Trump also called Obama ‚Äúthe founder of ISIS‚Äù for not leaving U.S. forces in Iraq and said that made Clinton ‚Äúthe co-founder.‚Äù In addition, he had sharp comments about the seating of Seddique Mateen, the father of Omar Mateen, who shot to death 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in June, behind Clinton at a rally in Kissimee, Florida. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it terrible when the father of the animal who killed the wonderful people was sitting with a big smile on his face right behind Hillary Clinton?‚Äù he said. Trump said he believed that people who sit behind the candidate at rallies are close to the campaign. Reporters noticed that sitting behind Trump at the event in Fort Lauderdale was former U.S. Representative Mark Foley, who resigned from Congress in 2006 after allegations surfaced that he had sent suggestive emails and sexually explicit instant messages to teenage boys who had been congressional pages. Foley told the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel he has been a long-time friend of Trump‚Äôs and has found him to be ‚Äúa different breed of leader and a different breed of candidate.‚Äù  ¬† ¬†Trump sharply criticized the news media for the way it handled a comment he made in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Tuesday suggesting gun rights supporters could take action against Clinton. ‚ÄúI would actually say that the media is almost as crooked as crooked Hillary Clinton,‚Äù Trump said. He drew harsh criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike because some took his remarks on Tuesday to mean he was inciting violence despite Trump‚Äôs insistence he was only urging more people to rally votes against Clinton.

Official: No formal Secret Service discussions with Trump camp on remark,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal official on Wednesday said the U.S. Secret Service had not formally spoken with Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign regarding his suggestion a day earlier that gun rights activists could stop Democratic rival Hillary Clinton from curtailing their access to firearms. Following Trump‚Äôs comment at a rally on Tuesday in which he suggested that gun rights activists could stop Clinton from appointing liberal anti-gun justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, a federal official familiar with the matter told Reuters that there had been no formal conversations between the Secret Service and the Trump campaign. Earlier CNN had reported that there had been multiple conversations between the campaign and the agency. ‚ÄúIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,‚Äù Trump told a North Carolina campaign rally on Tuesday. ‚ÄúAlthough the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he added, leading some critics to believe Trump was referring to gun violence against his rival.  The controversy came as the campaign tried to stay on message after a contentious previous week. Trump weathered criticism within his own party for delaying endorsements of fellow Republicans and for a prolonged clash with the family of a fallen Muslim American U.S. Army captain.  The campaign denied that inciting violence had been the intent of Tuesday‚Äôs remark, and on Wednesday said there had been no conversations with the Secret Service about it.  ‚ÄúNo such meeting or conversation ever happened,‚Äù Trump wrote on Twitter, accusing CNN of having made up the report.

One-in-five U.S. Republicans want Trump to drop out: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly one-fifth of registered Republicans want Donald Trump to drop out of the race for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday, reflecting the turmoil his candidacy has sown within his party. Some 19 percent think the New York real estate magnate should drop out, 70 percent think he should stay in and 10 percent say they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know,‚Äù according to the Aug. 5-8 poll of 396 registered Republicans. The poll has a confidence interval of six percentage points. Among all registered voters, some 44 percent want Trump to drop out. That is based on a survey of 1,162 registered voters, with a confidence interval of 3 percentage points. That is 9 points higher than his support for the presidency in the latest Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll.  The figures underscored deep divisions within the Republican Party over Trump‚Äôs candidacy. A number of prominent Republicans have declined to endorse him in the Nov. 8 election against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, citing his fiery rhetoric and  policy proposals such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country. Mike Smith, a 74-year-old retiree from Clearwater, Florida, said he supported Trump for much longer than he should have, but now feels the candidate should drop out of the race. Trump ‚Äúhas not comported himself as a leader,‚Äù said Smith, adding that he might vote for Clinton over his party‚Äôs nominee. ‚ÄúHis policies don‚Äôt seem to be well formed, they don‚Äôt seem to make any sense,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúThe support he has from Republicans almost seems obligatory rather than voluntary.‚Äù Trump found himself embroiled in yet another controversy on Tuesday after saying at a rally that gun rights activists could act to stop Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices - a comment his campaign said was misinterpreted, but that Clinton‚Äôs campaign called ‚Äúdangerous.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,‚Äù Trump said at the rally at the University of North Carolina. ‚ÄúAlthough the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he continued. The U.S. Constitution‚Äôs Second Amendment guarantees a right to keep and bear arms. Megan MacDonald, 25, is a Republican but did not support Trump through the primary. He has not done anything since to change her mind, and believes he should leave the race.  ‚ÄúI just feel there are so many derogatory things that have come out of his mouth, and he‚Äôs putting it out there ‚Äì it‚Äôs not like someone is finding skeletons in his closet,‚Äù said MacDonald, a stay-at-home mom in Louisiana, who may pick a third-party candidate. ‚ÄúIt feels like he‚Äôs not even trying to be a decent person who we should look up to.‚Äù Trump had previously stirred criticism for engaging in a spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. soldier killed in Iraq.  In addition, 50 prominent national security experts signed an open letter saying they would not vote for Trump in the fall, saying he ‚Äúlacks the character, values, and experience‚Äù to be president. Trump dismissed the group as part of the Washington establishment that he blames for many of the United States‚Äô problems. Stacie McDaniel, 42, said Trump‚Äôs rhetoric has, at times, made her think he should drop out of the race.  ‚ÄúSometimes I think he has good intentions, but his mouth gets overloaded,‚Äù said McDaniel, a relocation director for a real estate company in Louisiana. ‚ÄúI think he says things that if he does get elected, he‚Äôs not going to get anything done.‚Äù Still, she plans to vote for Trump, she said, because she cannot bring herself to support Clinton. ‚ÄúI dislike Hillary so much,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAs the lesser of two evils is why I‚Äôm voting for him.‚Äù Indeed, neither Trump nor Clinton enjoys great popularity. Some 53 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Clinton, who has been accused of mishandling her emails as secretary of state, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.  Nearly 63 percent have an unfavorable view of Trump. Clinton led Trump by more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, up from a less than 3-percentage-point lead late last week. ",politicsNews,"August 10, 2016 "

Ex-aide: Christie 'lied' about New Jersey 'Bridgegate' - filing,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former aide to Chris Christie said in a text message that the New Jersey governor ‚Äúflat out lied‚Äù when he said senior staff members were not involved in the ‚ÄúBridgegate‚Äù scandal in 2013, according to a court filing on Wednesday. The details were revealed in a document filed in New Jersey federal court by Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who is one of two former Christie allies facing trial next month on Bridgegate-related criminal charges. Speculation has persisted for years about whether Christie or members of his staff were aware of an alleged plot to close two New York City-bound lanes at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee as retribution against Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who had refused to back the Republican governor‚Äôs re-election campaign. Christie addressed the controversy at a Dec. 13, 2013, news conference, a day after the state legislature issued several subpoenas in its investigation of the lane closures. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made it very clear to everybody on my senior staff that if anyone had any knowledge about this that they needed to come forward to me and tell me about it, and they‚Äôve all assured me that they don‚Äôt,‚Äù Christie said at the time. Christina Renna, former director of Christie‚Äôs intergovernmental affairs office, immediately sent a text message to Peter Sheridan, a member of Christie‚Äôs re-election campaign, according to the filing. ‚ÄúAre you listening? He just flat out lied about senior staff and Stepien not being involved,‚Äù her first text said, referring to Bill Stepien, who managed Christie‚Äôs two gubernatorial campaigns. In a subsequent text, Renna said ‚Äúit could be bad‚Äù if emails were later uncovered through a subpoena or court discovery. Christie would apologize weeks later at another news conference, when he said he was firing his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and that he had been ‚Äúlied to‚Äù when he told reporters no one on his staff was involved. He also cut ties with Stepien, saying at the news conference that he had lost confidence in Stepien‚Äôs judgment. Stepien has not been charged in the case. ‚ÄúThe governor‚Äôs statements have been clear,‚Äù a Christie spokesman, Brian Murray, said on Wednesday. ‚ÄúNothing contained in this text message changes that in any way.‚Äù A lawyer for Renna, now vice president of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey, said she would not address the issue until she testifies at the upcoming criminal trial for Baroni and Kelly. Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Stepien, called the suggestion he might have been involved in Bridgegate ‚Äúcategorically false and irresponsible.‚Äù Sheridan, who works for the state Republican party, did not respond to a request for comment. Jury selection will begin Sept. 12 for Baroni and Kelly, who face charges including conspiracy and fraud. Another former Port Authority official, David Wildstein, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal prosecutors. ",politicsNews,"August 10, 2016 "
Appeals court suspends ruling rejecting parts of Wisconsin voter ID law,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday suspended a July 19 ruling by a federal judge that struck down parts of Wisconsin‚Äôs voter ID law, the Department of Justice said. Under the ruling by U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, Wisconsin voters who did not have photo identification would have been able to vote in the Nov. 8 presidential election. A Justice Department statement said that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit issued a stay concluding ‚Äúboth that the district court‚Äôs decision is likely to be reversed on appeal and that disruption of the state‚Äôs electoral system in the interim will cause irreparable injury.‚Äù Wisconsin is one of several Republican-led states that have passed voter ID laws in recent years amid fear of fraudulent voting by illegal immigrants and others. The nine states with the strictest laws, insisting on state-issued photo identification for voters, include Texas, Virginia, Indiana and Georgia. Republicans say voter ID laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. But Democrats say the laws are really intended to make it more difficult for poor African-Americans and Latinos, who skew Democratic in their politics, to vote. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, a Republican, called Wednesday‚Äôs appeals court decision ‚Äúa step in the right direction.‚Äù ‚ÄúVoters in Wisconsin support voter ID, and our administration will continue to work to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat,‚Äù Walker said in a statement. In a separate but related case, another federal judge on July 29 struck down a string of Wisconsin voting restrictions passed by the Republican-led legislature and ordered the state to revamp its voter identification rules, finding that they disenfranchised minority voters. U.S. District Judge James Peterson, ruling in a legal challenge to the laws by two liberal groups, said he could not overturn the entire voter ID law because a federal appeals court had already found such restrictions to be constitutional.

Trump Muslim comments do not tarnish view of U.S. freedoms abroad: ambassador,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States does not tarnish the U.S. commitment to religious freedom in the eyes of foreigners, a State Department official said on Wednesday. On Dec. 7, the week after a Muslim couple killed 14 people in San Bernardino, the Republican called for ‚Äúa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country‚Äôs representatives can figure out what is going on.‚Äù Speaking as he presented the State Department annual report on religious freedom, David Saperstein, the U.S. ambassador at large for that issue, was asked whether the comments made his job of promoting religious tolerance in foreign nations harder. ‚ÄúCountries across the globe ... they see clearly the basic constitutional, institutional constraints against violations of religious freedom in the United States, and I think see clearly and believe deeply in America‚Äôs promise to be a model about treating all people equally without regard to religion,‚Äù Saperstein said. ‚ÄúThat is clear and that is not tarnished by the statements here,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúNo matter who is elected, the institutions and the United States‚Äô constitutional constraints will ensure that we continue along the line we have for the last 200 years.‚Äù At the time, Trump‚Äôs comments were condemned by the White House, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and some of the candidates then vying with Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. More recently, the parents of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq took Trump to task at the Democratic National Convention over his rhetoric on Muslims, prompting a spat that triggered renewed criticism of the Republican candidate. Democratic presidential nominee Clinton‚Äôs lead over Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election increased to more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from less than 3 points on Thursday.

"Trump's remarks on gun rights, Clinton unleash torrent of criticism","WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday that gun rights activists could act to stop Democratic rival Hillary Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, igniting yet another fire storm of criticism just as he sought to steer clear of controversy. ‚ÄúIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,‚Äù Trump said at a rally. ‚ÄúAlthough the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he continued. The U.S. Constitution‚Äôs Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear firearms. Before the remark, Trump had been emphasizing his case against Clinton, who is leading in national opinion polls in the race for the Nov. 8 election. Some in the audience in North Carolina who were seated behind Trump could be seen wincing when he made the comment. Clinton‚Äôs campaign called the remark ‚Äúdangerous.‚Äù ‚ÄúA person seeking to be the president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way,‚Äù it said. ¬† When asked to clarify what Trump meant, his campaign said he was referring to getting supporters of the Second Amendment to rally votes for Trump in the election. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called the power of unification ‚Äì 2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power,‚Äù the Trump campaign said in its statement. Immediately after Trump made his comment, many on social media accused him of effectively calling for Clinton‚Äôs assassination. In just three hours, 2nd amendment became the top trending topic on Twitter, with more than 60,000 posts mentioning the term. Introducing Trump later at another rally in North Carolina, in Fayetteville, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani accused the news media of taking the remark out of context to help Clinton get elected. ‚ÄúWhat he meant by that was you have the power to vote against her,‚Äù Giuliani said to cheers. ‚ÄúYou have the power to speak against her. You know why? Because you‚Äôre Americans.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt proves that most of the press is in the tank for Hillary Clinton,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThey are doing everything they can to destroy Donald Trump.‚Äù The U.S. Secret Service, which provides security details for both Trump and Clinton and rarely comments on political matters, when asked for a response on Trump, said: ‚ÄúThe Secret Service is aware of the comment.‚Äù      Trump later told Fox News Channel‚Äôs ‚ÄúHannity‚Äù program that ‚Äúnobody in that room‚Äù thought he meant anything other than to rally support against Clinton. ‚ÄúThis is a strong powerful movement, the Second Amendment,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúHillary wants to take your guns away. She wants to leave you unprotected in your home.  This is a tremendous political movement.‚Äù By day‚Äôs end, Trump was drawing criticism on several fronts, another chapter in a campaign marked by bitterness and  partisanship. Michael Hayden, a former CIA director who on Monday was among 50 Republican national security experts to denounce Trump in a letter, said on CNN, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just responsible for what you say. You are responsible for what people hear.‚Äù U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal firebrand who loves tweaking Trump, tweeted that the Republican nominee ‚Äúmakes death threats because he‚Äôs a pathetic coward who can‚Äôt handle the fact that he‚Äôs losing to a girl.‚Äù Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway fought back in a tweet of her own, calling Warren a ‚Äúdisgrace.‚Äù Gun rights, which have long stirred strong emotions in America, have been a particularly potent issue in the 2016 presidential campaign as violence has convulsed some U.S. cities. Trump has planted himself firmly on the side of gun owners with a ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù campaign. Before his remark about Clinton on Tuesday, he had said Islamic State militants who killed 130 people in France last year could have been stopped if some of the victims had been armed. The Clinton campaign has challenged Trump when in the past he has accused her of planning to abolish the Second Amendment if elected president. Clinton, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to repeal the Second Amendment,‚Äù saying she wanted ‚Äúcommon-sense reforms‚Äù to gun laws. Tuesday‚Äôs speech came on the heels of a discordant week on the campaign trail for Trump, a businessman seeking his first public office. He came under fire from within his party for belatedly endorsing fellow Republicans in re-election races and a prolonged clash with the parents of fallen Muslim American Army captain Humayun Khan. On Monday, Trump seemed to be heeding Republican advice to stick to a message of criticizing Clinton and other Democrats while putting forward economic policy proposals in a speech in Detroit. Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, asked if he believed Trump was inciting violence toward Clinton, told NBC‚Äôs Philadelphia affiliate: ‚ÄúOf course not. No.‚Äù But Democrats called Trump‚Äôs remarks another sign of a candidate unfit for the White House. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt treat this as a political misstep. It‚Äôs an assassination threat, seriously upping the possibility of a national tragedy & crisis,‚Äù U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, said in a tweet. Overall sentiment on social media posts on Trump‚Äôs remarks was more negative than positive, at a ratio of 2.5 to 1, according to the social media analytics firm Zoomph. #ProtectHillary was also one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter. The 50 prominent national security officials said in their letter on Monday that Trump would be ‚Äúthe most reckless president in American history.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary,‚Äù their statement said.

German foreign minister says Trump dangerous for the world,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A series of controversial remarks by U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump show that the world should be concerned if he is elected president, a spokeswoman for German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Wednesday. Trump, a billionaire businessman seeking his first public office, has courted controversy with a string of inflammatory statements about women, Mexicans, Muslims and war veterans, among others. Steinmeier, unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel who has said she will not comment on the U.S. election, is not neutral on the issue because he believes it is important to draw attention to the dangers posed by Trump, said spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli. ‚ÄúHe is indeed not neutral on this question because he thinks that if you follow what Trump is saying then you need to be really anxious about what could become of this world ... if (he) does in fact become president,‚Äù Chebli told a regular government news conference. Steinmeier is from the centre-left Social Democrats, the junior partner in Merkel‚Äôs conservative-led ruling coalition. A spokeswoman for Merkel said the chancellor did not wish to interfere in the U.S. election campaign.

House Speaker Ryan easily wins primary: media,"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan handily won a primary election for his congressional seat on Tuesday, a contest overshadowed by presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs brief refusal last week to endorse his fellow Republican.  Ryan, who ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 2012, had roughly 84 percent of the vote compared with challenger Paul Nehlen‚Äôs 16 percent, with 87 percent of voting areas reporting results, the Journal Sentinel reported at 11 p.m. local time.  ‚ÄúI am humbled and honored that Wisconsinites in the 1st Congressional District support my efforts to keep fighting on their behalf,‚Äù Ryan said in a statement. In the general election for the 1st Congressional District seat in southeast Wisconsin on Nov. 8, he will likely face Iraq war veteran Ryan Solen, who won the Democrat primary on Tuesday.  Nehlen thanked his supporters in a brief Twitter post after the polls closed. ‚ÄúTruly an amazing journey,‚Äù he said.  The race became the center of attention a week ago when Trump refused to endorse Ryan during an interview with the Washington Post. In a sign of the tension between the politicians, Trump told the newspaper he was ‚Äúnot quite there yet‚Äù - echoing a phrase Ryan had used about Trump.  On Friday, Trump endorsed Ryan and Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire during a campaign stop in Green Bay, a show of support that could be a step to mend his frayed relations with fellow Republicans.  Trump, a former reality TV star, has troubled many in the Republican establishment with his off-the-cuff, often insulting, style and controversial policies. These include a proposed ban on Muslims visiting the United States and his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out undocumented immigrants. Ryan, Ayotte and McCain had criticized Trump‚Äôs feud with the family of Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004 and was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal for bravery. Trump had a running dispute with Khan‚Äôs parents after they criticized him at last month‚Äôs Democratic National Convention. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 "

In an interview, Flake said he still hopes Trump will change enough that the Republican senator from Arizona will be able to vote for the candidate in the Nov. 8 election. But, Flake said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a slim hope.‚Äù He said that as things stand, Trump will even have difficulty clinching the state of Arizona if the nominee, who has called for building a wall on the border with Mexico, does not develop a more ‚Äúserious‚Äù immigration policy. Arizona last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate two decades ago. ‚ÄúGiven the positions that he‚Äôs taken, if he continues to maintain those positions, if he continues to hold to the statements he has made, I don‚Äôt think he can win the presidency, nor do I think he should if he is unwilling to change,‚Äù Flake said of Trump. ‚ÄúThere is a big difference between winning a primary, getting what, 14 million votes, and getting 65 million votes that you‚Äôre going to need to win the presidency. In between those two numbers you encounter a number of swing voters, independents, who simply don‚Äôt cotton to the kind of message that he has been delivering. And that‚Äôs just the reality,‚Äù Flake said. Flake, 53, has long been one of Trump‚Äôs more vocal critics on Capitol Hill. Trump‚Äôs inflammatory remarks about immigrants have been a particular problem for Flake, whose Southwestern border state has a large Hispanic population. Flake was among eight senators who proposed comprehensive immigration reform in 2013. Flake memorably told a reporter last month that he would not be attending the Republican convention to nominate Trump because he had to mow the lawn. Flake told Vanity Fair magazine in July: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs much worry of a Trump presidency if he doesn‚Äôt change.‚Äù But he also insists that he will not vote for the Democratic candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Flake, a member of the House of Representatives for 12 years before being elected to the Senate in 2012, said Arizonans are more realistic and pragmatic on immigration than Trump. Right now, Flake said, Arizona is almost a ‚Äútoss-up‚Äù in the presidential election. Flake does not have to run for re-election to the Senate until 2018. His fellow Arizona senator, John McCain, is up for re-election this year, and faces both primary and general election challengers. McCain has said he backs Trump. Flake said he respected Senator Susan Collins of Maine, another Republican, who said in an opinion article published on Monday that she definitely would not vote for Trump. Flake said he was not prepared to follow Collins‚Äô example, which did not set off a stampede of Trump repudiations. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 "
"Trump underspends Clinton on TV ads, relying on social media: NBC","(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump, a former reality TV star, has yet to spend a dime on television advertising for his White House campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who has spent $52 million, NBC News said on Tuesday.  Adding the money laid out by outside groups supporting the candidates, the Clinton camp has spent $91 million on ads versus $8 million by Trump and his supporters, NBC News said. ‚ÄúNearly $100 million has been spent on general-election TV advertisements in the presidential race since the primary season ended, but Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign still hasn‚Äôt spent a single cent on one of them,‚Äù it said. One group supporting Trump - the Rebuilding America Now PAC led by Florida Governor Rick Scott - said it was rolling out an anti-Clinton ad on cable and local television stations in Ohio, Florida and North Carolina this week. While the New York businessman has not bought ads on ABC, CBS or NBC, which aired his reality show ‚ÄúThe Apprentice,‚Äù he has successfully used social media to reach the masses. He frequently posts to his Facebook page and on Twitter, and posts in turn are liked and shared countless times, earning Trump a free form of advertising. A study by media analytics firm mediaQuant placing monetary values on social media mentions estimates Trump is benefiting from about $2 billion in free media so far. That figure is expected to rise to $5 billion by the Nov. 8 election.   Clinton, too, has made gains in social media with 72 million mentions in July, pulling up with Trump in earned media after trailing him for the last eight months, mediaQuant said. The former secretary of state led Trump by more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 "
"Puerto Rico readies fiscal plan, awaits oversight board: governor","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico‚Äôs governor said on Tuesday he expected to present an updated fiscal plan for the debt-laden U.S. territory shortly after the White House appoints members of a federal oversight board with authority to renegotiate its $70 billion of debt. ‚ÄúI expect this new fiscal plan will be ready once the board is announced,‚Äù Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla told reporters in New York via a Skype video conference call from his office in San Juan. The call was part of an event organized by the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism. On June 30th, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act just one day before the island faced a deadline to make a debt payment of around $2 billion. Garcia Padilla authorized a suspension of the payments just after Obama signed the bill into law.  Under the act, the deadline for naming the seven-member board is Sept. 15. Garcia Padilla said on Tuesday he did not have any idea who would be named nor the timing, but hoped it would happen before the end of August. Obama will choose from candidates presented by Republican and Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives and Senate. Garcia Padilla, who is not running for reelection and has said the board would be an imposition on the island‚Äôs sovereignty, accepted that the legislation was needed in order to work out a solution. The oversight board has the authority to enforce balanced budgets and government reform if the Puerto Rican government fails to do so, including the sale of government assets, the consolidation of agencies and staff cuts. The board also has the authority to facilitate consensual restructuring talks, or push Puerto Rico into a court-supervised process akin to U.S. bankruptcy. After years of talks between the government and its creditors, failure to reach an agreement on restructuring the debt led to the passage of the legislation that all parties said was imperfect but necessary. Garcia Padilla said he was still open to talking with creditors and that ‚Äúprosperity will not return overnight.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 "
Clinton extends lead over Trump to 7 points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lead over Republican rival Donald Trump increased to more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from less than 3 points on Thursday. The shift came as Trump struggled to reset his campaign following a stretch of controversies. About 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton and about 35 percent preferred Trump, according to the Aug. 4-8 online poll of 1,152 likely voters, which had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The others would either pick another candidate, would not vote, or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know/refused.‚Äù The results reflected a decline in support for Trump, rather than a boost for Clinton: In last Thursday‚Äôs poll, 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton and about 39 percent favored Trump. Among registered voters over the same period, Clinton held a lead of nearly 13 percentage points, up from about 5 percentage points on Thursday, according to the poll.  The five-day survey concluded on a mixed day for the Trump campaign. After squabbles last week with party leaders and the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq, Trump sought to turn the page with a speech outlining an economic platform of tax breaks and regulatory rollbacks.  But in what was surely unwelcome news for Trump‚Äôs campaign, 50 heavyweight Republican national security officials, in a letter published on Monday, said that Trump would be ‚Äúthe most reckless president in American history.‚Äù Trump hit back, saying the signatories ‚Äúdeserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.‚Äù Trump faced more dissent within his party on Monday. A former CIA officer, Evan McMullin, announced he would run as an independent alternative to Trump for conservative Republicans, and Republican Senator Susan Collins said she would not vote for Trump. In a separate Reuters/Ipsos survey that gave respondents the option to choose from Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton leads Trump by about 6 percentage points. Of the alternative party candidates, Johnson came in third with nearly 8 percentage points, up from 6 points on Thursday. Stein has about 2 percentage points. The Aug. 4-8 survey of 1,154 likely voters had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. McMullin was not an option in the poll. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 "
Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas.  The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak: How do people become infected? Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. How do you treat Zika? There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization (WHO) had said early in 2016 that it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. A vaccine is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. U.S. government researchers said they started their first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at more than 1,700 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation had declined to 3,257. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 54 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (45): Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cura√ßao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saba, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Eustatius, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Cacos, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela. Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is ‚Äúrelatively common‚Äù and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. Those cases involved possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. But the CDC issued updated recommendations for preventing and testing for Zika infection on July 25, warning that the virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected female partner. A reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City, and limited human and non-human primate data indicating that Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions, led to the new warning, the agency said. CDC‚Äôs expanded warnings on sexual exposure to Zika now  caution against sex without a condom or other barrier method of protection with any person, male or female, who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika, including female to female transmission with a pregnant partner. British health officials reported Zika was found in a man‚Äôs semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. The WHO has identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 "

"Icahn praises Trump economic plan, says candidate will get blue-collar vote","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said on CNBC on Tuesday that Donald Trump is ‚Äúright on about the economy‚Äù and said ‚Äúthe Archie Bunker of the world‚Äù will vote for the Republican presidential candidate. Archie Bunker, a fictional conservative blue-collar worker from the New York City borough of Queens, was the main character in the 1970s television comedy ‚ÄúAll in the Family.‚Äù Icahn praised Trump‚Äôs economic plan a day after the New York real estate developer unveiled it in a speech in Detroit. Trump proposed sweeping tax breaks, cuts to federal regulations and a revival of the stalled Keystone XL project. Bunker has been described as the show‚Äôs ‚Äúlovable bigot,‚Äù but Icahn said there was no bad intention in comparing middle-class voters to the character. ‚ÄúAny middle-class worker, you know, ‚Äòthe Archie Bunker of the world‚Äô - that was a great show, I used to watch it - those guys are going to vote for him because those are smart guys,‚Äù Icahn said.  ‚ÄúThey know they are getting screwed, and that is what I think will happen,‚Äù Icahn said in an apparent reference to the decline in U.S. manufacturing, a theme of Trump‚Äôs. ‚ÄúArchie Bunker is a middle-class guy, somewhat educated even, that doesn‚Äôt know where his next check is coming to send his son or daughter to school, doesn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs going to keep his job. ... Why the hell should he vote for a system that is not giving him a good-paying job?‚Äù Icahn said. Icahn echoed his remarks on CNBC on Twitter, saying, ‚ÄúTrump is right on about our economy. A capitalistic system cannot exist if government is at war with business. CEOs rightly so are afraid to invest in new equipment, etc. to make our manufacturing competitive.  ‚ÄúIt is no surprise that today it was announced growth in productivity was down for the 3rd straight quarter and is at an all-time low. Our workers cannot be productive with ‚Äòworn out tools‚Äô.‚Äù    The Labor Department reported that U.S. nonfarm productivity unexpectedly fell in the second quarter, pointing to sustained weakness in the economy. Trump‚Äôs speech came after a week of falls in opinion polls and clashes with the family of a fallen U.S. Muslim soldier and fellow Republican leaders. Icahn said he did not defend Trump‚Äôs remarks about the family of soldier Humayun Khan, calling them a ‚Äúmistake. People make mistakes.‚Äù Asked by CNBC why Icahn was not named to Trump‚Äôs group of economic advisers, Icahn said he wanted to focus on a new Super PAC. Last week, Icahn‚Äôs general counsel, Jesse Lynn, told Reuters that Icahn turned down an invitation to join the group because the investor is considering funding a Super PAC focused on regulatory reform.

"Trump flops with Silicon Valley donors; Clinton falls short, too","(Reuters) - When Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman announced last week that she wouldn‚Äôt vote for her party‚Äôs presidential nominee, Donald Trump, she pledged to raise money for the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and to urge like-minded Republicans to follow suit. She won‚Äôt have to talk her fellow tech industry conservatives into spurning Trump: They already have.¬†His campaign has pulled in less than 6 percent of what Republican nominee Mitt Romney had raised from tech donors by this point in the 2012 race.  But raising money for Clinton may prove difficult. While the Democrat has raised 25 times more than Trump from tech donors so far, she has drawn less than half of what President Barack Obama had raised from tech employees by this point four years ago, and less than Bernie Sanders, her opponent in the Democratic primary, collected before he left the race. Tech industry employees ‚Äì long a reliable source of presidential donations, especially for Democrats ‚Äì have refused to open their wallets for Trump, and they‚Äôve been stingier than usual with Clinton, too, according to an analysis performed for Reuters by Crowdpac, a nonpartisan political crowdfunding startup that analyzes campaign contribution data.  Trump and Clinton together reported having received $3.5 million from tech workers as of June 30, compared with $11 million donated to President Barack Obama and his Republican rival Mitt Romney through June 2012, according to the Crowdpac analysis. In 2008, more than $8.3 million in tech donations had gone to Obama and McCain by June 30. For a graphic tracking contributions from tech workers in the last three elections, see: tmsnrt.rs/2b3nEuk The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on this story. The Clinton campaign asked for the methodology of the Crowdpac analysis but did not comment on its findings. To quantify the tech industry‚Äôs political giving, Crowdpac tallied contributions of more than $200 - the Federal Election Commission‚Äôs reporting threshold - from donors who listed technology companies as their employers, as well as individuals who work in related roles, such as software engineers and venture capitalists. Contributions to campaigns, Super PACs and joint fundraising committees were included. The analysis may have missed people who work at small technology companies not yet recognized by Crowdpac, as well as individuals who have given less than $200. Technology firms lobby the government on a range of issues, from privacy and encryption to immigration and trade, and they have a strong interest in who sits in the Oval Office. But this year, campaign finance records and interviews with more than two dozen people in the industry suggest that many would-be donors in Silicon Valley remain unwashed by either candidate.  Matt McIlwain, managing director of¬†Madrona¬†Venture Group, gave money to Romney in 2011 and to Republican Marco Rubio in year‚Äôs presidential primary election. But he won‚Äôt support either Trump or Clinton in the general election.  ‚ÄúCandidates need to have that embrace of innovation and articulate how it is a road for anybody in our society,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not inspired by either of the major party candidates.‚Äù  Democrats consistently draw more tech money than Republicans, but the giving is unusually lopsided this year. Trump has raised a mere $128,000 from 238 tech donors so far. Clinton, by contrast, has raised $3.4 million from 2,976 individuals in the industry, according to Crowdpac‚Äôs analysis.  At this point in 2012, Romney had raised $2.3 million and Obama had raised $8.8 million. Silicon Valley Republicans say Trump‚Äôs paltry donation totals are no surprise given his public statements attacking the tech industry.  Earlier this year, Trump called for a boycott of Apple products after the company stopped cooperating with federal law enforcement efforts to break into the password-protected iPhone of one attacker in the mass shooting in San Bernardino. Trump also accused Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos of orchestrating an online retail monopoly.  Trump‚Äôs positions on limiting immigration and free trade run counter to some of the industry‚Äôs most basic interests. For Clinton, having a long track record in politics is a liability with some donors in an industry that reveres innovation.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs an incremental technocrat, and for people who are used to taking on the world, that is not very inspiring,‚Äù said Gregory Ferenstein, author of ‚ÄúThe Age of Optimists,‚Äù a book about politics and Silicon Valley. To be sure, Clinton has many friends in Silicon Valley, and she has had considerably more success than Trump in wooing deep-pocket donors in the industry.  Venture capitalist John Doerr, for example, has contributed $569,500 to the Clinton campaign and affiliate Super PACs and fundraising committees, and Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus has given $358,800, according to Crowdpac. Many in the valley reason that backing Clinton is the surest way to thwart Trump. ‚ÄúWe want to make it clear what the risks are of a Trump presidency, but it‚Äôs much more energizing to get excited about a candidate,‚Äù Box Chief Executive Aaron Levie said in an interview. Some of Obama‚Äôs biggest Silicon Valley backers have yet to give money in this race, including Pandora Media Chief Executive Tim Westergren, who had donated $74,100 to Obama and to fundraising committees and affiliated Super PACs by June 2012, and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, who had given $35,000, according to a Crowdpac analysis of donations. Reliable GOP donors, too, have held back. Tiger Global Management Founder Charles Coleman and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen - both of whom had given $102,500 to Romney and affiliated Super PACs and fundraising committees by June 2012 - had yet to donate by June 30. Andreessen has endorsed Clinton. Westergren and Khosla did not respond to requests for comment; Coleman and Andreessen declined to comment. Carrie Sheffield, founder of multimedia company Bold, typically votes for Republicans and donated to Romney, but she says she won‚Äôt give to - or vote for - Trump.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that he‚Äôs fit for office,‚Äù she said. Both Clinton and Trump have also struggled to convert many donors who gave to their opponents in the primary.  Bernie Sanders raised far more in tech donations during the primary than Clinton, pulling in $6.2 million before leaving the primary race, most of it in small contributions.  In the Republican primary, Marco Rubio drew $5.3 million in tech donations, thanks to a handful of large gifts from top tech executives, including Oracle‚Äôs Larry Ellison, Mark Hurd and Safra Catz.  Josh Smith, a Sanders donor who does not plan to vote in the presidential election, said he was troubled by Clinton‚Äôs comments in a debate last year urging tech companies to work with law enforcement to prevent attacks. The remarks left some in the industry feeling that Clinton would not protect their livelihoods and did not share their beliefs about ‚Äúthe sanctity of information,‚Äù said Smith, founder of Code Corps, which helps developers work on public software projects for social good.  Sanders donor Xiaohoa Michelle Ching said she will vote for Clinton, but has had trouble supporting a candidate who has been readying her path to the presidency for so long.  ‚ÄúI am not going to go out of my way, even with the threat of a Trump presidency,‚Äù said Ching, who is chief executive of Literator, an educational technology startup. Ferenstein predicts that Silicon Valley donations to Clinton will pick up.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see much more money from Silicon Valley flow to Clinton toward the end of the race,‚Äù he predicted, ‚Äúbecause people are scared of a President Trump.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 "
"Obama, Senate Democrats urge Zika funding vote as reserves run low","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday said it was time for Congress to lay aside politics and to act to provide additional money to combat the Zika virus before government funding dries up. ‚ÄúOur experts at the CDC, the folks on the front lines have been doing their best in making due by moving funds from other areas, but now the money we need to fight Zika is rapidly running out,‚Äù Obama said at a press conference at the Pentagon. He warned that development of a vaccine for the virus could be delayed if Congress does not provide any more money and urged Americans to contact lawmakers to pressure them to take up the issue. Concern over the threat from Zika, which can cause a birth defect called microcephaly marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies, has risen since Florida authorities last week detected the first signs of local transmission in the continental United States. Zika funding remains stalled six months after Obama asked the Republican-led Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds. Forty-one Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urging them to summon lawmakers back from their summer recess to vote on emergency funding to fight the virus. But, Ryan accused Democrats of obstructing the funding and said the Obama administration has failed to spend existing funds to prevent the spread of the mosquito-borne virus. Congress has interrupted its own recesses at least eight times since 1998, most recently in 2013 when lawmakers returned early to debate the use of military force in Syria, according to congressional records. The latest round of finger-pointing indicated there was little chance lawmakers would cut short their seven-week summer break to vote on Zika funding. A $1.1 billion compromise failed after House Republicans attached language that would place restrictions on abortion and defund part of Obama‚Äôs signature 2010 healthcare law. Senate Democrats, who blocked the measure twice before Congress left Washington last month, want Republicans to agree on a new funding measure that drops those provisions, a step Republicans reject. ‚ÄúWe need the White House and Senate Democrats to drop politics and put the public‚Äôs health first. We hope for a change of heart, and soon,‚Äù Ryan wrote in an opinion piece in the USA Today newspaper. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart invited Democrats to allow the current bill to pass by unanimous consent at a perfunctory session on Friday. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 "

Trump seeks a campaign reset with Detroit economic speech,"DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump sought to regain momentum for his White House campaign on Monday by proposing sweeping tax breaks, cuts to federal regulations and a revival of the stalled Keystone XL oil pipeline project. The New York businessman used a speech on the economy in Detroit to try to turn the page after a week of missteps in which he came under heavy criticism, including from some in his own party, and rival Democrat Hillary Clinton surged ahead in opinion polls three months ahead of the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúI want to jump-start America,‚Äù Trump said, ‚Äúand it won‚Äôt even be that hard.‚Äù Trump stuck to prepared remarks rather than the freewheeling style that often produces controversial comments at rallies. He kept his cool as some 14 protesters jumped to their feet and shouted at coordinated intervals as he spoke at the Detroit Economic Club.  Trump‚Äôs remarks, which were repeatedly cheered by the crowd, appeared targeted at both an affluent business community and working people, in particular those who have suffered from a decline in U.S. manufacturing in cities such as Detroit. He dismissed Clinton as representing ‚Äúthe tired voices of the past.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a conversation about how to make America great again for everyone ... especially for those who have the very least.‚Äù Much of the speech reflected Republican talking points and critics said his proposals lacked detail. But Republican operatives and others who saw the speech praised Trump for turning his focus to policy and contrasting his ideas with Clinton‚Äôs. The question for Trump now is whether he will be able to keep his campaign on message as Republicans want him to do. Trump pitched a tax plan that mirrored traditional Republican thinking that lowering taxes and slashing regulation generates economic growth and jobs. He proposed lowering individual and corporate rates and a discounted 10 percent levy for businesses that bring back profits held overseas. Trump‚Äôs plan to create new tax deductions for childcare costs raised questions from economists about whether lower-income families would benefit. Many Republicans remain frustrated with his trade vision, which bucks party orthodoxy by calling for a rewrite of major agreements. ‚ÄúMy response is good, bad and ugly,‚Äù said Lanhee Chen, who was policy director for the 2012 presidential campaign of Republican Mitt Romney. ‚ÄúI think the trade position remains pretty ugly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I understand why they did it. I think it‚Äôs a strong effort, at least, to meld elements of conservative economic policy with Trump‚Äôs more populist thinking.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs effort to shift focus came after what was widely seen as the worst week of his campaign, in which he sparred with party leaders and got entangled in a dispute with the parents of a Muslim U.S. soldier who was killed in the Iraq war. Republican Senator Susan Collins added her name on Monday to a growing list of Republican lawmakers who say they will not vote for Trump. Some frustrated Republicans plan to back a conservative alternative, former CIA officer Evan McMullin. On Monday, Trump waited for the frequent disruptions by protesters to end, smiling and refraining from his practice at campaign rallies of asking security to ‚Äúget them out of here.‚Äù A group called the Michigan People‚Äôs Campaign took credit for the protests, which they said were aimed at Trump‚Äôs recent comments about sexual harassment. Clinton will outline her economic vision in Michigan on Thursday. In a statement issued before Trump‚Äôs speech, her campaign said his plan would give tax breaks to the wealthy and big companies and would hurt working families.  At a rally on Monday in St. Petersburg, Florida, she derided a list of economic advisers Trump released last week as ‚Äúsix guys named Steve.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow, they tried to make his old, tired ideas sound new,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúHe wants to basically just repackage trickle-down economics.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs rough week took its toll in opinion polls. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Sunday gave Clinton an eight-point lead, 50 percent to 42 percent.  Trump, a real estate developer who has never held elected public office, touts his practical experience and potential to create jobs, blaming President Barack Obama for what he calls a weak recovery from the economic recession. On Monday, he said Clinton would rely on policies that have not worked. ‚ÄúShe is the candidate of the past,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúOurs is the campaign of the future.‚Äù Reaction from the crowd in Detroit was mixed.  ‚ÄúI think he laid out a good bullet point on how he‚Äôs going to solve the economic problems with his trade policies,‚Äù said insurance executive Sal Giammursta. Others wanted more details. ‚ÄúPeople were looking for more substance,‚Äù said lawyer Al Rogalski. Trump called for a temporary moratorium on new regulations and repeated his pledges to rewrite the landmark North American trade deal that President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs husband, signed in 1994, and to withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal backed by Obama. But much of the reaction was to Trump‚Äôs tax plan. He again proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent. And he proposed lowering income-based individual tax brackets to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. In 2015, Trump proposed a lower top rate of 25 percent. After criticism from budget experts who said such low rates would balloon deficits, he tweaked his proposal to be more in line with policies supported by Republicans in Congress. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs encouraging that Donald Trump appears to be modifying his tax plan,‚Äù said Maya MacGuineas, president of the anti-debt Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The research group Tax Policy Center estimated in December that Trump‚Äôs original plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $9.5 trillion in the first decade.  Steve Moore, an adviser to Trump, said the campaign believes it has made changes to bring the plan‚Äôs cost down to $2 trillion to $3 trillion. A campaign aide said Trump would give more detail in a later speech. ",politicsNews,"August 8, 2016 "

Republican national security experts: Trump would be 'dangerous' president,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fifty prominent Republican national security officials, including a former CIA director, on Monday called party nominee Donald Trump unqualified to lead the country and said he would be ‚Äúthe most reckless president in American history.‚Äù The statement was the latest repudiation of Trump‚Äôs candidacy by veteran Republican national security specialists, and was remarkable for the harshness of its language. ‚ÄúMr. Trump lacks the character, values, and experience to be president. He weakens U.S. moral authority as the leader of the free world. He appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúNone of us will vote for Donald Trump,‚Äù said the statement, which noted that some signatories also have doubts about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúFrom a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be president and commander in chief,‚Äù said the statement, which was first reported in the New York Times. ‚ÄúIndeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous president and would put at risk our country‚Äôs national security and well-being.‚Äù The signatories, some of whom worked for more than one Republican president, included former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden, who also headed the National Security Agency; former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte; and two former U.S. trade representatives, Carla Hills and Robert Zoelick. Other signatories included former senior State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council officials who helped plan and oversee the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Trump has harshly criticized the Iraq operation, although when radio host Howard Stern asked him in 2002 if he favored invading Iraq, Trump said he guessed he did. The statement was organized by Philip Zelikow, who served as a top adviser to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Trump responded with a statement deriding the signatories as members of ‚Äúthe failed Washington elite‚Äù who ‚Äúdeserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese insiders ‚Äì along with Hillary Clinton ‚Äì are the owners of the disastrous decisions to invade Iraq, allow Americans to die in Benghazi, and they are the ones who allowed the rise of ISIS,‚Äù he continued, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group. The statement did not cite specific comments by Trump, but it clearly was a response to a series of remarks he has made questioning the need for NATO, expressing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling for a temporary ban on immigration by Muslims, and inviting Russia to hack Clinton‚Äôs private email server - which he later said was a joke. Many of the signatories had declined to sign an open letter disputing Trump‚Äôs national security qualifications that was published in March. The statement said many Americans are frustrated with the federal government‚Äôs failure to solve domestic and international problems. ‚ÄúBut Donald Trump is not the answer to America‚Äôs daunting challenges and to this crucial election,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúWe are convinced that in the Oval Office, he would be the most reckless President in American history. Some Democratic foreign policy experts called the statement a reminder of the divisions the New York real estate developer‚Äôs nomination has sown within the Republican Party. ‚ÄúThis letter is signed by those who remain in the internationalist wing of the party ‚Äì many were former advisors to candidates who lost the primary fight to Trump,‚Äù said Brian Katulis, a fellow at the Center for American Progress and a Clinton campaign adviser. ‚ÄúCalling Trump unqualified to be commander in chief is tough, but also asserting that he‚Äôs lacking in character and understanding of our basic values is really pretty amazing,‚Äù said Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman in Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration. ‚ÄúThat said, I think it‚Äôs unlikely to influence many voters, but it could give cover to Republican members of Congress and donors who want to cut the cord and move on from Trump.‚Äù (For the complete statement go to: here) ",politicsNews,"August 8, 2016 "
Ex-rival sues Illinois House speaker for 'dirty' election tactics,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A vanquished challenger to Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan filed a federal lawsuit on Monday against the longtime Democratic leader, accusing him of using dirty tactics to beat him in a March primary election. Chicago Democrat Jason Gonzales accused Madigan of defaming him and crowding the primary with ‚Äúphony‚Äù candidates to dilute his opposition. Gonzalez named the 45-year incumbent, the speaker‚Äôs political funds, a top aide and his two other opponents, among others, in a 39-count lawsuit over an alleged scheme to swing the four-way race in the speaker‚Äôs favor.  ‚ÄúMadigan won because he engaged in dirty, illegal, fraudulent tactics,‚Äù Gonzales, who finished second in his bid to topple Madigan with 27 percent of the vote, said in a telephone interview. Madigan received slightly more than 65 percent. Madigan said in a statement that the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, was ‚Äúwithout merit.‚Äù  ‚ÄúVoters of my district soundly re-nominated me based on my strong record of service, giving me more than 65 percent of the vote, and they emphatically rejected Jason Gonzales because they knew he couldn‚Äôt be trusted,‚Äù said Madigan, who is Illinois‚Äô longest-serving officeholder, representing Chicago‚Äôs southwest side since 1971. Neither Grasiela Rodriguez nor Joe Barboza, the two other candidates named in Gonzales‚Äô lawsuit, could be reached for comment. Gonzales accused Madigan of falsely calling him a felon on television commercials and in political mailers based on several arrests and criminal convictions between 1991 and 1994, including the use of stolen credit cards as an 18-year-old. Gonzales alleged that Madigan improperly publicized those criminal records, which should not have been made public after former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn granted a pardon and expunged Gonzales‚Äô criminal record in January 2015. ‚ÄúMadigan‚Äôs defamatory statement was one that harmed Gonzales‚Äô reputation to the extent it lowered Gonzales in the eyes of the community and deterred the community from associating with him,‚Äù his lawsuit alleged. ‚ÄúAs a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts and/or omissions by Madigan, Gonzales suffered injuries of a personal and pecuniary nature, including emotional distress, damage to reputation and further punishment despite being granted full pardons,‚Äù the lawsuit said. Gonzales also accused Madigan and his aides of diluting the Hispanic vote in a legislative district that is about 70 percent Latino by planting two opponents with Hispanic surnames on the ballot. Neither of the candidates, who collectively received nearly 8 percent of the vote, actively campaigned. Gonzales‚Äô case is being handled by Tony Peraica, a former Republican member of the Cook County board. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find a Democratic lawyer who was wiling to take the case,‚Äù Gonzalez told Reuters. ‚ÄúEverybody was scared of Madigan.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 8, 2016 "
"A disenchanted Republican, fearing Trump, launches third-party run","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former CIA officer and congressional staffer on Monday launched a long-shot bid for president, a Republican billing himself as a conservative alternative to Donald Trump who disenchanted voters can rally around. There is virtually no chance that the newly announced candidate, Evan McMullin, could win and only a slight chance he will even be able to get his name on the ballots of key states. McMullin has no name recognition across the country and was not even well known in the Capitol where until Monday he was the chief policy director for the organizational body of all Republicans in the House of Representatives. But that will not stop some conservatives from pitching him as an option in the Nov. 8 election for those who never warmed to Trump and remain adamantly opposed to Democrat Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúDonald Trump appeals to the worst fears of Americans at a time we need unity, not division,‚Äù McMullin wrote in a letter announcing his candidacy. ‚ÄúWith the stakes so high for our nation and at this late stage in the process, I can no longer stand on the sidelines.‚Äù  McMullin‚Äôs campaign was first reported by MSNBC and BuzzFeed. He could not be immediately reached for comment. Trump was formally anointed his party‚Äôs nominee last month after beating 16 rivals in the state-by-state primary contests. But many Republicans have been concerned about Trump‚Äôs policies, such as his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country, and his free-wheeling, often insulting rhetoric. McMullin has never held public office. In addition to lacking a quick source of campaign cash, he will face immediate hurdles to try to get his name on enough ballot papers to make himself a serious candidate. Texas, for example, requires third-party candidates to get more than 79,000 signatures from residents who did not vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. And the deadline for that was in early May.  Deadlines to get on the ballots have also lapsed for North Carolina, Illinois and Florida, all large states that also could be pivotal in the election. The best McMullin could likely hope for would be to simply play spoiler to Trump in a handful of states, eating away at the New York real estate developer‚Äôs ability to win states that are generally reliably Republican. McMullin would join two other third-party hopefuls - Gary Johnson, who was nominated by the Libertarian Party, and Jill Stein, who will represent the Green Party. In recent polls that included Trump, Clinton, Stein and Trump, the two third-party candidates have both struggled to get above 10 percentage points in the polls. McMullin, who according to his LinkedIn profile worked in Congress since 2013, has been a frequent critic of Trump on social media, calling him an authoritarian and criticizing his stance on civil rights as well as his refusal to release his tax returns. Prior to working in Congress, McMullin spent 11 years as an operations officer for the Central Intelligence Agency.  Trump, meanwhile, was seeking to reset his campaign with a big economy policy speech on Monday after a rough patch last week. He was widely criticized, including by some senior Republicans, for engaging in a public dispute with the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. ",politicsNews,"August 8, 2016 "

But a review of filings showed that his political giving has largely benefited Republicans over the years, including donations this election cycle to political action committees that supported primary candidates Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio. He has also given to the campaigns of Democrats, including now-U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Mark Warner, according to the filings. He contributed $4,600 to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2007 presidential race, while also giving to the campaigns of Republicans John McCain and Rudy Giuliani.

Trump to propose deduction on childcare spending: aide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will propose allowing parents to deduct spending on childcare from their income taxes in a speech on Monday meant to challenge the economic policies of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, a campaign aide said. The aide, who asked not to be identified, said on Sunday in outlining the plan: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want it to be an economic disadvantage to have children.‚Äù The aide said the campaign would have a more detailed childcare plan in the future. A wealthy businessman seeking his first public office, Trump seeks to counter Clinton‚Äôs argument he is out of touch with the problems of working families. He will also say that, unlike Clinton, his business policies would encourage companies to remain in the United States, a concern of blue-collar workers he has tried to court, the aide said. In his speech, to business leaders of the Detroit Economic Club, Trump will also propose stronger protections for American intellectual property and a temporary moratorium on new regulations, the aide said. Seeking to move beyond a week of discord, Trump will outline  plans for trade, taxes, regulation and energy policy. His plans include proposing a 15 percent corporate tax rate, an idea that is on his website. The current federal rate is 35 percent. Senior aides and supporters said in television appearances on Sunday that Trump wanted to put behind him his disputes of last week with Republican Party leaders and the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. With the economy a major issue, Clinton on Thursday lays out a plan of her own for the ‚Äúbiggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War Two,‚Äù her campaign said. A Democrat like President Barack Obama, Clinton will be buoyed by figures released on Friday showing U.S. employment rose more than expected for a second month in a row in July and wages picked up, bolstering expectations of faster economic growth. Clinton has pledged that no family should pay more than 10 percent of its income on childcare. She has called for a tax cut to help middle-class parents cope with rising childcare costs and an expansion of a federally funded program that provides education and health services to low-income families with young children. In a phone call lasting little more than an hour on Sunday and run by some of Trump‚Äôs most senior aides, members of his newly announced economic advisory group shared their views on policy, said banker Stephen Calk, one of the members who took part. The Clinton campaign has criticized Trump over the advisory group, announced on Friday, for including no women and relying on members who come from hedge funds and investment banking, a make-up at odds somewhat with Trump‚Äôs populist message. Calk, chief executive of Federal Savings Bank and National Bancorp Holdings, said Trump had asked advisory group members to nominate women and minorities who could be added to the group. He said there were some ‚Äúbig, recognizable‚Äù names on the call who would be announced soon as joining the team but did not elaborate. A new Washington Post-ABC News opinion poll on Sunday showed Trump trailing Clinton by 8 percentage points after her party‚Äôs convention in Philadelphia.

"Bentley, former Congresswoman from Maryland, dies at 92","(Reuters) - Helen Delich Bentley, a former journalist and a U.S. Republican congresswoman from Maryland who gained global attention by smashing Japanese goods to protest Tokyo‚Äôs trade policies, died over the weekend at the age of 92, officials said. Bentley upset a longtime Democratic congressman to win a U.S. House of Representatives seat in 1984, a year in which Ronald Reagan‚Äôs landslide victory in the presidential race helped bring several new faces from the party to Congress. The five-term congresswoman was a staunch advocate for the port of Baltimore and the state‚Äôs maritime industry. After reports that Japanese company Toshiba had sold technology to the Soviet Union to help their submarines sail more quietly, she led other members of Congress who used a sledgehammer to smash Japanese-made goods on the Capitol steps. The event came as tensions were running high with Tokyo over a widening U.S. trade deficit with the country.  She left Congress to run for governor of Maryland but lost in the party‚Äôs primary. ‚ÄúCongresswoman Bentley worked with tenacity, energy, and passion on behalf of her constituents, making her a rare breed in politics and a role model to public servants across Maryland,‚Äù current Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, wrote in a Facebook post. Bentley was born in 1923 in Nevada and her parents were immigrants from Yugoslavia.

Trump ends difficult week by focusing on Hillary Clinton,"WINDHAM, N.H. (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Saturday ended a tough week for his campaign in the state that launched him toward the presidential nomination and he did what Republicans have been urging him to do: Keep the focus on Democrat Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúHer greatest achievement is getting out of trouble,‚Äù Trump told supporters. Trump‚Äôs victory in the Feb. 10 Republican primary in New Hampshire put him in position to win the party‚Äôs nomination, but he trails Clinton in the state by 15 points in the latest WBUR/MassINC¬†poll, 47 percent to 32 percent. Trump came to New Hampshire after a troubled week in which he tangled with fellow Republican leaders and sparred verbally with the parents of a Muslim soldier who died fighting for the United States in Iraq in 2004. Clinton, getting a lift from the Democratic National Convention, took advantage of Trump‚Äôs stumbles to surge into the lead in national polls and in many battleground states.  Now Trump has begun heeding the advice of Republican officials who say he needs to take the fight to Clinton to give the party a chance to win the White House on Nov. 8. Trump seized on Clinton‚Äôs comments Friday that she had ‚Äúshort-circuited‚Äù when she said a week ago that FBI Director James Comey had said she had been truthful to the American people in her use of a private email server while U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. In fact, Comey had concluded that Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù with classified emails. He directly contradicted many of the statements Clinton had made about her use of the server. Trump spent the lion‚Äôs share of a campaign speech in a crowded high school gymnasium to go after Clinton on the subject in trying to raise questions about her trustworthiness. ‚ÄúI think the people of this country don‚Äôt want somebody who is going to short circuit,‚Äù Trump said. Trump also sought to turn the tables on Clinton, who has consistently accused the New York developer of being temperamentally unfit to be president. ‚ÄúShe is a totally unhinged person,‚Äù Trump said.

Pence‚Äôs job is harder: softening Trump‚Äôs rough edges and limiting the fallout from what many Republicans see as the nominee‚Äôs self-inflicted wounds. A week ago, for example, Pence rowed back on Trump‚Äôs blacklist of some media outlets, saying the campaign is discussing changing course. Last Sunday, as Trump‚Äôs dispute with the parents of slain U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan boiled over, Pence issued a statement praising the soldier as an ‚ÄúAmerican hero‚Äù and saying that his family ‚Äúshould be cherished by every American.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬† On Wednesday, Pence offered his own endorsement to House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, after Trump infuriated many party leaders by declining to endorse Ryan in his re-election bid. Pence, who swore off negative campaigning after losing a vituperative congressional race in 1990, eschews name calling. Trump, by contrast, delights in using monikers such as ‚ÄúCrooked Hillary‚Äù and ‚Äúthe devil‚Äù to describe Clinton. Trump has made clear he values Pence, telling a rally on Thursday in Portland, Maine, that he and his running mate have a ‚Äúgreat relationship.‚Äù But Pence must walk a fine line. Even as he defuses Trump‚Äôs verbal bombs, Pence must be careful to show he knows who is boss. He also has to stick to his own principles while not appearing to be trying to undermine the man who chose him as his No. 2. Should Trump win, Pence, a former congressman, could serve as a conduit to the U.S. Congress. But if Trump loses, Pence could emerge as a possible White House contender for 2020. Republican strategist Charlie Black said Pence has shown some political deftness. ‚ÄúHe should have expected he would do some of this and provide more of the even-tempered, articulate, measured responses,‚Äù Black said. But Republican strategist Ryan Williams said Pence is in an ‚Äúimpossible spot‚Äù and said that Trump‚Äôs missteps could cast a shadow over his running mate‚Äôs political future. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúMike Pence is a good Republican but unfortunately he will be associated with the controversies that have ensnared the Trump-Pence ticket and will be tied to whatever the consequences of this election are,‚Äù  Williams said. ¬†¬†¬† Trump‚Äôs off-the-cuff insults and controversial proposals, such as a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep illegal immigrants out, have made many in the party establishment uneasy. The Republican nominee‚Äôs feud with the Khan family made for an awkward moment for Pence at a campaign event in Carson City, Nevada. A military mother asked Pence how could he tolerate Trump‚Äôs disrespect for the armed forces, which prompted boos. Pence admonished the crowd to tone it down. ‚ÄúFolks, that‚Äôs what freedom looks like and that‚Äôs what freedom sounds like,‚Äù he said before calling Humayun Khan an American hero. Pence was asked on Thursday by an 11-year-old boy at a North Carolina rally if his role was ‚Äúsoftening up‚Äù Trump‚Äôs policies and words. Pence replied that he and Trump were ‚Äúshoulder to shoulder‚Äù in the campaign. Christopher Devine, co-author of the book ‚ÄúThe VP Advantage‚Äù and an assistant political science professor at the University of Dayton in Ohio, said that if Trump loses the November election, Pence may try to position himself as a conservative bridge between Trump supporters and traditional Republicans. That may be an added reason for Pence‚Äôs cautious approach. ‚ÄúHe has to be very careful about how he handles the defense of Donald Trump,‚Äù Devine said. ",politicsNews,"August 5, 2016 "
Obama administration releases redacted version of drone policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration released a redacted version of President Barack Obama‚Äôs once-secret policy on drone strikes abroad following a freedom of information lawsuit filed last year, the American Civil Liberties Union said on Saturday. The release of the 18-page Presidential Policy Guidance document, as well as other Department of Defense papers, follows an order by a U.S. District Court judge in February requiring the Justice Department to disclose the document, also known as ‚Äúthe Playbook.‚Äù It sets out the law and rules the government must follow when carrying out targeted killings and the capture of terrorist suspects abroad.  Obama pledged in 2013 to provide greater transparency about counter-terrorism operations, including drone strikes overseas, amid calls by some U.S. lawmakers and rights groups for more openness.   ACLU‚Äôs deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, welcomed the release of the documents, saying they provide new details about policy standards and insights into the process for targeting individuals with lethal force or for capture. ‚ÄúIts release now will inform an ongoing debate about the lawfulness and wisdom of the government‚Äôs counter-terrorism policies,‚Äù Jaffer said in a statement. The ACLU‚Äôs lawsuit sought information, among other things, on the law and policies used to justify lethal force and how the government picks targets. According to the documents, published by the ACLU, strikes against high-value terrorist targets can be taken ‚Äúwhen there is near certainty‚Äù that the person is present, and that no civilians will be injured or killed, and is necessary to ‚Äúachieve U.S. policy objectives‚Äù. The administration has defended its use of drones as essential in fighting al Qaeda and other militants in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen. Some drone strikes have killed civilians who were not targets, igniting local anger. ‚ÄúThe president has emphasized that the U.S. Government should be as transparent as possible with the American people about our counter-terrorism operations, the manner in which they are conducted, and their results,‚Äù National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said of Saturday‚Äôs release of documents. ‚ÄúOur counter-terrorism actions are effective and legal, and their legitimacy is best demonstrated by making public more information about these actions as well as setting clear standards for other nations to follow,‚Äù he added. Naureen Shah, Amnesty International‚Äôs U.S. director for security and human rights, also welcomed the documents but said more was needed to ensure the policy was followed. ‚ÄúThe Obama administration‚Äôs disclosures are welcome but they only tell part of the story and obscure disturbing practices. We still know extremely little about the standards that would govern signature strikes and so-called rescuer strikes, which have involved potentially unlawful killings,‚Äù Shah added.

"Trump endorses Ryan, senators in effort to right campaign ship","GREEN BAY, Wis./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump acted to steer his White House campaign back into favor with his party‚Äôs establishment on Friday by endorsing U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and two Republican senators seeking re-election, after expressing coolness toward them earlier this week. ‚ÄúI need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make,‚Äù Trump said during a rally in Green Bay, in northern Wisconsin, Ryan‚Äôs home state. He also endorsed Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, calling Ayotte a ‚Äúrising star.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends,‚Äù Trump said,  Trump earlier this week refused to endorse Ryan, telling The Washington Post he was ‚Äúnot quite there yet‚Äù - nearly the same phrase Ryan had used about Trump before finally endorsing him. Trump said in the same interview that McCain had not done enough for veterans and criticized Ayotte for distancing herself from him during the campaign. Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, had no plans to attend the Wisconsin event, a sign of lingering frictions between the pair, even though Trump‚Äôs running mate, Mike Pence, did endorse him. Ryan‚Äôs Republican primary challenger, businessman Paul Nehlen, did attend, according to a spokesman. Ryan is expected to win the challenge for his House seat in next week‚Äôs Republican primary, and he is viewed by many Republicans as a possible presidential candidate in the future. The tension between Ryan and Trump caused deep frustration among party leaders and lawmakers. Trump‚Äôs endorsement came as one of several steps to get his campaign back on track after days of controversy and falling poll numbers that have given Democrat Hillary Clinton the advantage in the race to the Nov. 8 election. In the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, Clinton‚Äôs lead over Trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points, down from nearly 8 points on Monday. Trump said on Friday he wanted a ‚Äúbig tent‚Äù party with multiple viewpoints welcome. He said he was endorsing the Republican lawmakers due to their ‚Äúshared mission to make America great again.‚Äù Trump also announced a new advisory team to help guide him on economic policy. The group relies heavily on hedge fund managers and investment bankers, a group Trump has railed against. There are no women on the team. Trump plans to release his economic policy framework in a speech in Detroit on Monday, an event that will offer him a chance to avoid theatrics and detail how he would handle economic issues if elected. Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore told Reuters that the candidate‚Äôs plan would focus on four areas: tax, deregulation, energy policy and trade. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be an all-encompassing look at how we reform the economy,‚Äù Moore said. At events in Des Moines, Iowa, and Green Bay, Trump showed discipline that is unusual at his often free-wheeling rallies, calling Clinton the ‚Äúqueen of corruption‚Äù and defending himself against her charge that he is temperamentally unfit for the White House. ‚ÄúAll my life I‚Äôve been told, ‚ÄòYou have the greatest temperament,‚Äô‚Äù he said in Des Moines. He also said voters should consider supporting him because of Pence, who appeared with him at both events. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like me, that‚Äôs okay. Vote for Pence because it‚Äôs the same thing,‚Äù Trump said. Trump bashed the media as well, saying reporters over-hyped an incident earlier in the week and claimed he kicked a baby out of an event in Virginia. ‚ÄúI love babies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSHORT-CIRCUITED‚Äù Clinton sought to take advantage of Trump‚Äôs dip in the polls at a conference of minority journalists in Washington, where she pledged an all-out fight for comprehensive immigration reform. And she did what she has rarely done during the presidential campaign: take questions from reporters. She addressed two of the largest issues that continue to dog her campaign: the controversy over her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state and continuing skepticism among voters about her trustworthiness. Clinton conceded that she had ‚Äúshort-circuited‚Äù earlier in the week in interviews when she had asserted that FBI director James Comey had concluded that she had been truthful in her statements about use of the private server.  Clinton had repeatedly said she never sent emails containing classified material, a finding that Comey contradicted at the conclusion of the FBI‚Äôs probe in July, when he rebuked her for ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of classified information while recommending that no criminal charges be filed. On Friday, Clinton maintained, ‚ÄúI never sent or received anything marked classified,‚Äù while acknowledging that some material she sent may retroactively have been considered classified by other government agencies. Republicans have repeatedly charged that Clinton endangered national security with her handling of classified material. The email controversy has fueled a perception among a majority of voters that Clinton is untrustworthy. ‚ÄúI take it seriously,‚Äù she said. Still, as she has often done during her career, Clinton attributed much of her low standing on this issue to attacks from Republicans. Trump‚Äôs campaign said his economic advisory panel included former steel executive Dan DiMicco; Howard Lorber, CEO of tobacco company Vector Group Ltd (VGR.N); and Trump campaign finance chairman and investment manager Steven Mnuchin.  Hedge fund managers John Paulson and Steve Feinberg, Moore, the Trump economic adviser, and David Malpass, who has served in previous Republican administrations, were also named. Trump‚Äôs moves came after many Republicans urged the candidate to correct course following a tumultuous week. The real estate mogul and former reality television star was  caught up for days in a public spat with the parents of a Muslim  American soldier killed in Iraq. The parents had criticized Trump at last week‚Äôs Democratic National Convention. Many Republicans, including Ryan, McCain and Ayotte, were critical of Trump‚Äôs insistent attacks on the pair.

Clinton's lead over Trump narrows to less than three points: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lead over Republican rival Donald Trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday, down from nearly eight points on Monday. About 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton, to Trump‚Äôs 39 percent, according to the July 31-Aug. 4 online poll of 1,154 likely voters. The poll had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points, meaning that the results suggest the race is roughly even. Among registered voters over the same period, Clinton held a lead of five percentage points, down from eight percentage points on Monday, according to the poll.  The reasons behind the shift were unclear.  Clinton had pulled well ahead of Trump on the heels of the Democratic National Convention last week, where she became the first woman to accept the U.S. presidential nomination from a major political party.  Since then, Trump has engaged in a days-long feud with the family of an American soldier killed in Iraq and squabbled with the Republican leadership over his comments and leadership turmoil within his campaign. Trump, in recent days, however, has sought to refocus. On Friday he announced his economic policy advisory team, said he would deliver an economic policy speech early next week, and was expected to endorse U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, who is seeking his 10th term in Congress. An average of polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics showed Clinton ahead of Trump by 6.8 percentage points on Friday, up from 3.9 on Aug. 1. ",politicsNews,"August 5, 2016 "
Factbox: Republican presidential candidate Trump's economic team,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday announced his team of economic advisers, among whom are a hedge fund manager, a former top steel executive and a former high-ranking U.S. government official.  Trump said he would deliver a speech on his economic policy plan on Monday. Here are some facts on the members of his economic team: Paulson is best known on Wall Street for his bet against the overheated housing market in 2007 that netted him and his investors billions of dollars in profits. But Paulson‚Äôs calls on stocks and the economy have been less accurate lately. His investments have lost some $15 billion in assets in the last five years, leaving his Paulson & Co Inc hedge fund with roughly $13 billion at the end of June. He is known for making contrarian bets and being patient.  He has been one of only a handful of hedge fund managers to have publicly endorsed Trump. Many others have said privately that they are still on the fence or leaning toward his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Feinberg is chief executive officer of Cerberus Capital Management LP, a private equity firm he co-founded in 1992.  He headed the investment firm during its failed takeover of automaker Chrysler in 2007. The investment firm served as Chrysler‚Äôs majority owner until the troubled car maker was restructured in a government-sponsored bankruptcy in 2009. Feinberg had promised to revive the company, according to a New York Times profile, but instead lost billions. (here) Feinberg has defended his role to try to save the carmaker. He ultimately had to appeal to Washington for help.      Malpass served under two previous Republican administrations, first as a deputy assistant Treasury secretary for President Ronald Reagan and later as a deputy assistant secretary of State for President George H.W. Bush.         Malpass, in a CNBC interview on Friday, called for greater infrastructure spending as well as tax cuts, trade reform, regulatory reform and energy reform, although he gave few specifics. ‚ÄúWe need more effective spending and Trump wants to do that - to have stronger finances for the country,‚Äù he said. Malpass has been a vocal critic of the U.S. Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy since the financial crisis, in particular its large bond holdings. Malpass, who was also previously chief economist at investment bank Bear Stearns, now runs Encima Global Llc, an investment consulting firm.  ¬†¬†¬† Navarro is the only adviser on the list with a doctorate in economics and the only one who has spent most of his life as an academic. He earned his doctorate at Harvard University and is now a professor of economics and public policy at the University of California, Irvine‚Äôs business school. Navarro has written nine books, three of them critical about China‚Äôs effect on the rest of the world, including ‚ÄúDeath by China: Confronting the Dragon ‚Äì A Global Call to Action.‚Äù He thinks the United States should be tougher on trade and intellectual property theft and has proposed slapping a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. ¬†¬†¬† Navarro recently wrote in an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times that Trump would crack down on any country ‚Äúthat cheats on its trade deals using practices such as currency manipulation and illegal export subsidies.‚Äù (here) Lorber is president and CEO of holding company Vector Group Ltd (VGR.N), whose three subsidiaries make cigarettes as well as e-cigarettes. Vector also operates two real estate subsidiaries: a real estate investment company and a real estate brokerage firm.  A fellow New Yorker, Trump's campaign has mentioned Lorber as one of Trump's best friends. (here) The two traveled together to Russia in the 1990s, according to news reports. A former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc who now works in entertainment financing, Mnuchin is chairman and CEO of private investment firm Dune Capital Management LP.  Trump named Mnuchin, who had a long history of political donations to Democrats, including to Hillary Clinton, as his finance chair in May. Mnuchin has said he has had a personal and professional relationship with Trump for more than 15 years.¬† DiMicco is the former chief executive and executive chairman of steel producer Nucor Corp (NUE.N), one of the biggest U.S. steelmakers. His outspoken push for tougher U.S. trade policies to support domestic manufacturing and his fierce anti-China rhetoric have made him one of the most high-profile executives in the steel industry. In recent years, he has taken his campaign for new trade rules online and has publicly endorsed Trump‚Äôs call for a tougher approach on trade.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt win a Trade War with appeasement or more Free Trade agreements,‚Äù DiMicco wrote in a July 10 blog post on his website, www.dandimicco.com.  Moore is one of the leading conservative economic voices in the United States. He embraces tax cuts as key to economic growth, as well as free trade and immigration reform. Moore founded the anti-tax advocacy group Club for Growth, where he served until he left the organization in 2004. He later served as a member of The Wall Street Journal editorial board.      He is currently a fellow at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, focusing on economic growth.  Barrack is a longtime friend of Trump and a fellow hotel developer. He is the founder and executive chairman of private equity firm Colony Capital Inc CLNY.N and is co-chairman of the board of trustees of Colony Starwood Homes SFR.N. Barrack spoke out in favor of Trump at the Republican National Convention in July, but afterwards his company announced it was dropping out of Trump's Old Post Office hotel project in Washington, according to a report in The Washington Post. (here) Kowalski has served as the deputy staff director of the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and has over 20 years of experience in fiscal policy at the federal, state and local levels of government. He has a master‚Äôs degree in public policy from Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government.  Beal is the founder and chairman of Beal Bank as well as affiliated companies including, CSG Investments, Inc, Loan Acquisition Corporation, and CLG Hedge Fund, LLC.  Calk is the founder, chairman and CEO of Federal Savings Bank, and National Bancorp Holdings. He is a commissioned Army officer and received his MBA from Northwestern University.

Trump's economic advisory group clashes with populist image,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs team of economic policy advisers is packed with moguls from the hedge fund and investment banking industries that he has railed against in the past. And none of them are women - a demographic group he needs to court if he hopes to win in November. Trump‚Äôs campaign has been powered by a populist message that criticizes corporate America for outsourcing jobs, profiting at the expense of everyday workers and buying influence in Washington. The message resonates best with middle-class and working-class voters buffeted by the forces of globalization.  But among the members of the 13-member team of advisers announced on Friday are hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson and investment bankers Steve Feinberg and Andy Beal, as well as a former top steel executive and a former high-ranking U.S. government official.  ‚Äú‚ÄéIt is a hallowed campaign tradition. Malign an industry, but court its wealthy big shots,‚Äù said¬†Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan. The reliance on Wall Street executives comes after Trump spent much of his primary campaign lambasting the industry for paying too little in taxes. ‚ÄúThe hedge fund guys are getting away with murder,‚Äù Trump said in an interview last year. One of the best known of Trump‚Äôs panel is Paulson, whose bet against the overheated housing market in 2007 netted him and his investors billions of dollars. His bets have since gone the other way, losing some $15 billion in the last five years. Don Steinbrugge, managing partner at investment consulting firm Agecroft Partners LLC, said Trump could benefit from his advisers‚Äô expertise on global capital markets if he ‚Äúwould listen to them.‚Äù Whether Trump will heed the counsel of his conservative-leaning economic advisers or steer his own course was also raised by Lanhee Chen, who served as a top policy aide to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to see a consistent strain of conservative economic thought,‚Äù Chen said, citing Trump‚Äôs protectionist policies on trade as an example of where Trump differs from the Republican party‚Äôs free-market economic orthodoxy. The panel also includes former steel executive Dan DiMicco; oil magnate Harold Hamm; Howard Lorber, the CEO of tobacco company Vector Group Ltd; Trump campaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who is now chairman and CEO of private investment firm Dune Capital Management LP; and David Malpass, a former official of the U.S. Treasury and State departments. James Pethokoukis, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, noted the absence of representatives from the tech and venture capital sectors.  ‚ÄúIf I was assembling a task force to analyze the big challenges facing the American economy and to develop solutions, I am not sure that a group like this would naturally spring to mind,‚Äù he said. But the panel fits with the themes of Trump‚Äôs campaign in another way. Trump often has boasted about bringing in successful business people to tackle Washington‚Äôs entrenched problems, and many of Trump‚Äôs supporters see his background in business as among his biggest assets. Some critics seized upon the lack of women on Trump‚Äôs panel. After being asked this week to identify women he might appoint to his cabinet if elected, Trump could only respond with the name of his daughter Ivanka.  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton hit Trump on the comment in a Twitter post, comparing him to Romney who, when asked a similar question during his campaign, said he‚Äôd reviewed ‚Äúbinders full of women.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe know a guy with a binder,¬†@realDonaldTrump. (He might not take your calls, though.)‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs campaign wrote. The campaign declined to comment on Trump‚Äôs advisers. Trump has struggled with women voters since his campaign began. Some 65 percent of women have an unfavorable view of Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, compared with 53 percent who have an unfavorable view of Clinton. Kellyanne Conway, a pollster who works for the Trump campaign, said the emphasis on gender on the economic team is misplaced. Women voters, she said, care more about their economic well-being than the make-up of an advisory group. ‚ÄúWhat female voters wish to know is whose economic plan will be better for them,‚Äù she said.

"Icahn declines to join Trump economic team, mulls second Super PAC"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn turned down an invitation to join Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs economic advisory council because Icahn is considering funding a Super PAC focused on regulatory reform, Icahn‚Äôs general counsel told Reuters on Friday.

DON‚ÄôT MISS: Factbox: Trump's economic team Want to build your own¬†Economic Dream Team? Try this machine. Trump looks to right the ship The first Super PAC Icahn formed had an initial commitment of $150 million and was targeted at ‚Äútax inversions,‚Äù which occur when a company moves its headquarters outside the United States to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.  ‚ÄúMr. Icahn declined the opportunity to join the Trump economic advisory council because at this time, we‚Äôre still considering whether to fund and manage our own Super PAC focused on regulatory reform,‚Äù Jesse Lynn, general counsel to Icahn, said by telephone.  ‚ÄúFEC (Federal Election Commission) rules would limit that activity if Mr. Icahn were to become directly involved in the campaign by joining the council,‚Äù Lynn said.  There was no immediate comment from the Trump campaign.  Trump announced his economic advisory team on Friday, and said he would release his plan to boost the U.S. economy in a speech on Monday.  Trump has floated Icahn‚Äôs name for U.S. Treasury secretary if he was elected president. Icahn, 80, has repeatedly rejected the notion of accepting such an offer.  Lynn did not give any details on what kind of regulatory reforms a new Super PAC may target.  In September, Icahn released a video titled ‚ÄúDanger Ahead,‚Äù in which he endorsed Trump for president and criticized the Federal Reserve for creating a new bubble in the corporate bond market.

Much of this debt is sold to ‚ÄúMom and Pop‚Äù investors via exchange-traded funds, a popular vehicle for trading baskets of bonds and stocks.  In October, Icahn announced his first Super PAC, which was the biggest one-time injection of money in the history of such political action committees. Icahn said the incentive for companies to leave the United States via inversion deals could be eliminated by legislation allowing big companies to repatriate funds held offshore at a discounted tax rate - an approach also favored by Trump.

Senior ex-CIA official: Putin made Trump 'an unwitting agent' of Russia,"(Reuters) - A former top CIA official attacked Donald Trump on Friday as a danger to national security, saying President Vladimir Putin had made the Republican presidential candidate an ‚Äúunwitting agent‚Äù of Russia. Putin had flattered Trump into supporting positions favorable to Russia, Michael Morell, a longtime CIA officer and former deputy director of the agency, said in an opinion piece in The New York Times. ‚ÄúIn the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation,‚Äù Morell said, in an article in which he endorsed Trump‚Äôs rival in the Nov. 8 election, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Morell did not provide evidence for his assertion, but he said Putin had used skills from his past as an intelligence officer to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in an individual. ‚ÄúThat is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trump‚Äôs vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated,‚Äù Morell wrote. Trump‚Äôs campaign dismissed Morell‚Äôs criticism, linking the ex-CIA officer to the Obama administration‚Äôs public response after the September 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. ‚ÄúCount how many reporters will tweet today that Michael Morell lied for #CrookedHillary to cover up Benghazi,‚Äù Trump‚Äôs campaign said in a Twitter message.  The incident, in which the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed, occurred while Clinton was secretary of state, and Republicans have long criticized her handling of the attack and its aftermath. Critics say administration officials tried to play down the role of Islamist militants in the attacks. Morell approved talking points after the incident. U.S. officials have said any reference to militants taking part was initially dropped for classification reasons. Morell is currently affiliated with Beacon Global Strategies, a consulting firm with ties to senior Democrats with national security expertise, including former defense secretary and CIA director Leon Panetta and former top Clinton aide Philippe Reines.¬† Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, on Friday dismissed Morell‚Äôs comments, saying that  ‚Äústanding up to Russian aggression is going to be really different under a Trump-Pence administration.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese people are playing politics,‚Äù Pence said of Morell in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù program.  Morell‚Äôs article, in which he also said Trump had undermined U.S. security with his campaign proposal to combat terrorism by imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, added to questions raised by some national security experts about the New York businessman‚Äôs qualifications to be president. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of experts criticized Trump‚Äôs lukewarm support for the NATO alliance, comments about Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea and other matters as ‚Äúdisgraceful.‚Äù Trump has also drawn criticism for his praise for Putin as a strong leader, particularly after Moscow came under suspicion from U.S. officials as being behind recent hacking of Democratic Party groups.

Clint Eastwood: Trump says 'dumb things' but people should 'get over it'," (Please note strong language in paragraphs 3, 11) By Jill Serjeant (Reuters) - Clint Eastwood, the 86-year-old four-time Oscar winner, excoriated the current generation of Americans as weak and overly sensitive while backing Donald Trump even though the Republican presidential hopeful has ‚Äúsaid a lot of dumb things.‚Äù Eastwood, a prominent celebrity supporter of the Republican Party who appeared at its 2012 U.S. presidential nominating convention, offered a harsh assessment of Americans in an interview with Esquire magazine published on Wednesday. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs onto something because secretly everybody‚Äôs getting tired of political correctness, kissing up,‚Äù the acclaimed actor and director said of Trump. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the kiss-ass generation we‚Äôre in right now.

I‚Äôd have to go for Trump ... you know, ‚Äòcause she‚Äôs declared that she‚Äôs gonna follow in Obama‚Äôs footsteps.‚Äù In one of the most unusual speeches at a major U.S. party convention, Eastwood four years ago addressed an empty chair used to symbolically represent President Barack Obama on stage at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, in a rambling denunciation of Obama. Asked by Esquire what troubled him most, Eastwood referred to his chair speech. ‚ÄúWhat troubles me ... I guess when I did that silly thing at the Republican convention, talking to the chair,‚Äù Eastwood said. In the interview, Eastwood made reference to the uproar in May that followed Trump‚Äôs comments accusing the judge overseeing a fraud lawsuit involving Trump University real-estate seminars of being biased against him because of Trump‚Äôs pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to block illegal immigrants. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel is an American of Mexican descent. Eastwood told Esquire that Trump was portrayed as ‚Äúa racist now because he‚Äôs talked about this judge.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd yeah, it‚Äôs a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion on the fact that the guy was born to Mexican parents or something,‚Äù Eastwood said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody - the press and everybody‚Äôs going, ‚ÄòOh, well, that‚Äôs racist,‚Äô and they‚Äôre making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It‚Äôs a sad time in history.‚Äù There were more than 100 tweets per minute about Eastwood on Twitter by Thursday afternoon.

You said what needed to be said,‚Äù tweeted a person named Ruari. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 "
California mayor charged in youth camp strip poker scandal,"(Reuters) - The mayor of Stockton, California, was arrested on Thursday on a felony eavesdropping charge stemming from a strip poker game he is accused of surreptitiously recording at a summer camp he hosts for disadvantaged inner-city children, prosecutors said. Mayor Anthony Ray Silva, 41, was also charged with three misdemeanor counts - contributing to the delinquency of a minor, child endangerment and furnishing alcoholic beverages to individuals under the legal drinking age of 21, according to a criminal complaint filed in court. Silva is accused of using his cellphone to make an audio recording of conversation among several young people, including a 16-year-old boy, who were playing strip poker with the mayor inside his cabin at the camp. Prosecutors said in a media statement it was evident that the participants, who were naked, were recorded against their will. Amador County District Attorney Todd Riebe said those present besides the mayor included two to three females and three males, all ranging in age from 18 to 20. The criminal complaint further accuses Silva of supplying alcohol to six underage youths. Prosecutors said some were camp counselors. The incidents, according to prosecutors, took place last August at the Stockton Silver Lake Camp in Amador County, which lies in California Gold Country on the edge of the Sierras northeast of Stockton. In addition to hosting unprivileged children at the city-leased camp each summer, Silva has served as president of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Stockton for the past six years. Silva‚Äôs lawyer, Mark Reichel, told Reuters his client ‚Äúwill be vindicated‚Äù and suggested the case was politically motivated, noting that the mayor, a Republican, faces a tough election run-off in November against a Democratic city councilman. Asked whether Silva was playing strip poker with youths from his camp, Reichel replied, ‚ÄúI highly doubt it.‚Äù Reichel added, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to fight them in court, so we can expose the epidemic of kids at summer camp playing strip poker.‚Äù Silva was elected mayor of Stockton, a city of about 300,000 east of San Francisco, in November 2012, months after the municipality filed for bankruptcy. The city emerged from bankruptcy protection in February 2015. Silva, who is not married, was arrested by FBI agents Thursday morning at the camp and released on $20,000 bond later in the day.  His next court date is Aug. 18. If convicted of the charges, he could face up to three years in prison. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 "
Obama warns Trump not to spread details of security briefings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama confirmed on Thursday that Donald Trump will get national security briefings ahead of the November election, but he warned the Republican candidate, whom he has called ‚Äúunfit‚Äù for office, that information from the meetings must be kept secret. Obama, a Democrat who endorsed his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 White House race, has made clear his dismay over Trump, a New York businessman who has proposed temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States and building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. On Tuesday Obama questioned why leading Republicans have not withdrawn their support for their presidential nominee. On Thursday he dismissed as ridiculous Trump‚Äôs claims that the election may be rigged. ‚ÄúOf course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?‚Äù Obama said with exasperation. ‚ÄúIf Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on Election Day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. That doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case at the moment.‚Äù Trump is trailing Clinton in polls. Despite his disdain, Obama said Trump would get the top secret briefings on world crises and security threats to which he, Clinton and their respective vice presidential running mates are entitled. Some Republicans have said Clinton should be denied access to such briefings because of her handling of classified material on a private email server while she was secretary of state.  Obama on Thursday, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, made clear that both candidates would be treated equally. ‚ÄúWe are going to go by the law, which is that, in both tradition and the law, that if somebody is the nominee ... they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWhat I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings,‚Äù he added, in response to a question about whether he was concerned about Trump obtaining the classified information. ‚ÄúAnd if they want to be president, they got to start acting like president, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around.‚Äù Trump has placed blame on Clinton and Obama for the rise of Islamic State, also known as ISIS. ‚ÄúThe Obama-Clinton foreign policy gave rise to ISIS, made Iran flush with cash, and is now admitting vast numbers of refugees and migrants into the United States from some of the most volatile regions in the world,‚Äù Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said in a statement. ‚ÄúBut none of this is surprising from an Administration that allowed its Secretary of State to threaten the country with a private email server, delete her records, and lie about it to us all,‚Äù Miller said. Obama, who was meeting with his national security advisers about the fight against Islamic State, also made a subtle jab at Trump for his dispute with a Muslim couple whose U.S. Army captain son died in Iraq. Obama lauded ‚Äúpatriotic Muslim Americans‚Äù who fight in the U.S. armed forces. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 "
"Amid campaign turmoil, Trump allies urge him to get back on track","WASHINGTON/PORTLAND, Me. (Reuters) - Supporters of Republican Donald Trump urged him to get back on message on Thursday after a week of dropping opinion poll numbers and a war of words with ranking Republicans over his U.S. presidential campaign. In response to the criticism, Trump pledged to focus more on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who emerged from last week‚Äôs Democratic National Convention with a lead in the polls and who has been consistently attacking him as temperamentally unfit for the presidency. At a rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday, Trump kept his attention on trying to undermine Clinton‚Äôs candidacy. He said the fact that she has moved past a scandal over her use of a private email server as President Barack Obama‚Äôs secretary of state was ‚Äúprobably the greatest accomplishment that she has ever had in politics.‚Äù Since formally accepting the Republican nomination two weeks ago, Trump has exasperated many supporters by getting bogged down in a public spat with the parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq and some fellow Republicans. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross said he still backed Trump, but urged him to stop engaging in exchanges that benefit the Democrats and make the real estate mogul‚Äôs behavior the issue in the campaign. ‚ÄúThis election is Donald‚Äôs to lose and so far the Democrats have been clever about baiting him and he generally has bitten,‚Äù Ross said in an email to Reuters late on Wednesday. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who has endorsed Trump but has not received a reciprocal endorsement from the New York businessman in his re-election bid, told WTAQ radio host Jerry Bader in Green Bay, Wisconsin, that Trump has ‚Äúhad a pretty strange run since the convention.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou would think we ought to be focusing on Hillary Clinton, on all of her deficiencies. She is such a weak candidate that one would think we‚Äôd be on offense against Hillary Clinton, and it is distressing that that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre talking about these days,‚Äù he said. Michael Caputo, a former Trump adviser who still supports him, said Trump still has time to right the ship. ‚ÄúStaying on message is absolutely key,‚Äù Caputo told Reuters. ‚ÄúAfter 30 years of speaking his mind, Mr. Trump has to understand that the general election for president of the United States is all about staying on message.‚Äù Actor and director Clint Eastwood, a prominent celebrity supporter of the Republican Party who appeared at its 2012 U.S. presidential nominating convention, offered an alternative view, saying Trump says some ‚Äúdumb things‚Äù but that Americans should get over it. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs onto something because secretly everybody‚Äôs getting tired of political correctness, kissing up,‚Äù the acclaimed actor and director told Esquire magazine. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the kiss-ass generation we‚Äôre in right now.‚Äù At the same time, Trump‚Äôs lukewarm support for the NATO alliance drew criticism from 37 national security experts from both Democratic and Republican administrations. ‚ÄúWe find Trump‚Äôs comments to be reckless, dangerous, and extremely unwise,‚Äù they wrote in a statement. Obama, at a Pentagon news conference, dismissed Trump‚Äôs statements that the election could be ‚Äúrigged‚Äù against him. ‚ÄúOf course, the elections will not be rigged,‚Äù he said. Trump‚Äôs rough patch has contributed to a dip in support in some battleground states. A WBUR/MassINC¬†poll in New Hampshire showed Clinton leading Trump, 47 percent to 32 percent. Other polls showed Trump down 11 percentage points to Clinton in Pennsylvania and 6 percentage points in Florida, two states that are important to his chances of winning the election. Trump‚Äôs troubles are emboldening Democrats to think big. Speaking with reporters after a Clinton campaign event in Las Vegas, U.S. Senator Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, said he believed traditionally Republican-leaning states such as Arizona and Georgia are going to be competitive this election, and he expects Clinton to campaign there. In Portland, some people at Trump‚Äôs rally said the candidate should stop getting distracted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like how he gets off track,‚Äù said Bill Devine, 65, of Bath, Maine. ‚ÄúHe needs to stay focused on his campaign.‚Äù Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Morning‚Äù that the campaign is comfortable where it stands now and said the news media have built a false narrative in which Democrats are controlling the race to the Nov. 8 election. Manafort said that Trump‚Äôs dropping poll numbers ‚Äúwere expected‚Äù and that he expected the numbers to even out soon. ‚ÄúThe framework of this election favors Donald Trump. If we run the campaign that we plan on running, we think we‚Äôre going to win,‚Äù he said.  Concern about Trump has spilled into at least one congressional race. U.S. Representative Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, has released a campaign ad in his own re-election bid promising to ‚Äústand up‚Äù to Trump if Trump is elected. ‚ÄúPeople ask me, ‚ÄòWhat do you think about Trump?‚Äô Honestly, I don‚Äôt care for him much. And I certainly don‚Äôt trust Hillary,‚Äù Coffman said in the ad. U.S. Representative Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican, told MSNBC he could not endorse Trump because of ‚Äúall these unforced errors‚Äù that Trump was making. ‚ÄúIt just seems that he‚Äôs, at times, hell-bent on losing a very winnable election to a very seriously flawed candidate: Hillary Clinton,‚Äù Dent said.

"In slap at Trump, some wealthy Republicans campaign for Clinton","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Groups of wealthy Republicans unhappy with Donald Trump have been privately courting prominent peers to join them in backing Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs U.S. presidential bid, several people involved in the effort told Reuters. They say they are seeking money and endorsements from other Republicans disillusioned by Trump, their party‚Äôs candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Some have received encouragement from Clinton and members of her campaign staff.  ‚ÄúI made the decision that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to look at my grandkids if I voted for Trump,‚Äù said Dan Webb, a former federal prosecutor and a self-described ‚ÄúRepublican for decades‚Äù working to win over prominent Republican business people in Chicago. Trump, a New York developer making his first run at public office, has made traditional Republican donors uneasy with inflammatory statements about women, Mexicans, Muslims and war veterans, among others.  Big-name Wall Street donors can make a difference for Clinton. They could inject big money into a campaign. They might influence moderate Republicans to switch sides. Their support of Clinton challenges Trump‚Äôs assertion that his business successes make him a better candidate for president. With the political conventions barely over, the Republican effort to fundraise for Clinton is at an early stage. Some of the groups have yet to receive contributions because they must still file paperwork under campaign finance rules. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined to comment for this story. Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said business leaders are supporting Clinton because of her economic plan and because Trump ‚Äúcannot be trusted to lead our economy.‚Äù Groups formed to support Clinton include Republicans for Her 2016, run by Republican lobbyist Craig Snyder; a grassroots organization called R4C16, led by John Stubbs and Ricardo Reyes,  officials in former President George W. Bush‚Äôs administration; and the Republican Women for Hillary group co-led by Jennifer Pierotti Lim, an official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  The first two groups are acting independently of Clinton‚Äôs own effort. The third is acting in concert with her campaign. ‚ÄúWe wanted to go out there and be the voice for Republicans who were feeling wary about Trump and weird about publicly endorsing Hillary,‚Äù said Pierotti Lim, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention at the Clinton team‚Äôs invitation. Webb, a partner at law firm Winston & Strawn, said he began his outreach after being approached by billionaire investor J.B. Pritzker and longtime Clinton associate Lanny Davis. Pritzker and Davis could not be reached for comment. On Wednesday, billionaire hedge fund manager Seth Klarman said he would work to get Clinton elected because of comments by Trump he found ‚Äúshockingly unacceptable.‚Äù Although Klarman, who is the president and chief executive of The Baupost Group, is a registered independent, a review of filings shows his political giving has largely benefited Republicans over the years, including some of Trump‚Äôs rivals in the state-by-state nominating contests this year. Jim Cicconi, a former Reagan and George H.W. White House staff member and lifelong Republican, said he went public with his decision to support Clinton ‚Äúto encourage others in my situation to do the same thing.‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel like I need to do something more than quietly pulling the lever,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to assist the campaign in any way that they want me to help.‚Äù  Spearheading in part the Clinton effort to woo Republicans on Wall Street is Democratic strategist Leslie Dach, a former Walmart executive and aide to Bill Clinton, sources close to the Clinton campaign said.  People familiar with the Clinton drive say the Democratic nominee herself has spoken to Republican business leaders, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise Chief Executive Meg Whitman, who endorsed Clinton on Tuesday. Clinton deputies courted former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ahead of a rousing speech he gave at last month‚Äôs Democratic National Convention that urged Wall Street to support her. Whether Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire media mogul and an erstwhile Republican, will play a role in courting other Republican business leaders has yet to be determined, a source close to the discussions said. While some major donors are hesitant to back Trump, the candidate over the last month has pulled in millions of dollars in small-money donations to boost total contributions to more than $80 million for Trump‚Äôs campaign and the Republican Party, nearly matching Clinton‚Äôs $90 million haul during the same period.

Former U.S. security officials call Trump comments 'disgraceful',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of former U.S. national security officials, including some who have worked for top Republicans, called Donald Trump‚Äôs recent comments about NATO, Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea and other matters ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù in a letter released on Thursday. In the last month, the Republican presidential nominee has suggested he might not defend NATO allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite Russia to hack the emails of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and suggested he might accept Russia‚Äôs 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. ‚ÄúThese are disgraceful statements that betray our longstanding values and national interests embraced by presidents of both parties,‚Äù said the open letter first reported by The Washington Post. Most of the 37 who signed the letter appear to be Democrats, including Madeleine Albright and Leon Panetta, respectively former secretaries of state and defense, but others served under Republican presidents and lawmakers. Among these, John Bellinger was State Department legal adviser for former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Randy Scheunemann, a neoconservative political operative, was foreign policy advisor to Republican John McCain‚Äôs presidential campaign. Other signatories included former career diplomats Tom Pickering, Bill Burns, Nicholas Burns and Marc Grossman, all of whom served as undersecretary of state for political affairs, effectively the third-ranking U.S. diplomat.   The letter is the latest in a series from former national security officials dismayed at the thought of a Trump presidency. In March, more than 90 Republican foreign policy veterans, including former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, signed a letter pledging to oppose Trump and saying his proposals would undermine U.S. security.

House Speaker Ryan: No point in lame duck vote on TPP deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that he saw no point in bringing up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal for a vote in any ‚Äúlame duck‚Äù session of Congress later this year after November elections, because ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have the votes.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs long as we don‚Äôt have the votes, I see no point in bringing up an agreement only to defeat it,‚Äù Ryan, a Republican, said in an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio.  Despite both U.S. presidential candidates bashing the 12-country Pacific trade deal on the campaign trail, Obama administration officials have pledged to make a major push in coming months to persuade the Republican-majority Congress to pass TPP.  Backed by dozens of business and industry groups, officials  from the U.S. Commerce Department, the U.S. Trade Representative‚Äôs office and the White House say they are continuing to talk with individual lawmakers about the merits of the deal, including its consequences for U.S. leadership in Asia.  But Ryan said the Obama administration had negotiated a deal that ‚Äúcost them dozens of votes in Congress,‚Äù and said the Democratic president needed to renegotiate some components. The speaker said some agricultural and labor provisions needed fixing, and he also believed the deal would reduce intellectual property rights for biologic drugs and pharmaceuticals. For U.S. drugmakers the deal could reduce the patent protection period to eight years from the current 12. Senator Orrin Hatch, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has also raised this as a major problem with the deal. ‚ÄúThey have to fix this agreement and renegotiate some pieces of it if they have any hope or chance of passing it,‚Äù Ryan said in the radio interview, but added that he was doubtful this could happen. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôll ever get the votes for it.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 "

Obama administration denies Iran cash payment was a ransom,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Wednesday that $400 million in cash paid to Iran soon after the release of five Americans detained by Tehran was not ransom as some Republicans have charged. The five, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, were released on Jan. 16 in exchange for seven Iranians held in the United States for sanctions violations. The prisoner deal coincided with the lifting of international sanctions against Tehran. At the time, the United States said it had settled a longstanding Iranian claim at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague, releasing $400 million in funds frozen since 1981, plus $1.3 billion in interest that was owed to Iran. The funds were part of a trust fund Iran used before its 1979 Islamic Revolution to buy U.S. military equipment that was tied up for decades in litigation at the tribunal. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, on Wednesday sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry asking him to appear at a future committee hearing to discuss the payment.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest rejected suggestions the money transfer to Iran was ransom or a secret.  ¬†¬† ‚ÄúThe United States, under President Obama, has not paid a ransom to secure the release of Americans unjustly detained in Iran and we‚Äôre not going to pay a ransom,‚Äù he said in response to a Wall Street Journal article that said Washington secretly organized the cash airlift. ¬†¬†¬† Earnest said Republicans, who have long opposed the Iran nuclear deal, are seizing on how the money was paid to Iran as a way to undermine the deal. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre struggling to justify their opposition to our engagement with Iran,‚Äù he told a briefing. While there have long been questions about the timing of the payment, one Iranian concern was that the Obama administration could face too much domestic political criticism if it delayed acting on the tribunal‚Äôs decision. Due to international sanctions against Iran, the payment, made in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies, had to be made in cash, U.S. officials argue. One U.S. official said the $1.3 billion in interest was paid to Iran through the U.S. Treasury-administered Judgment Fund, which is used to pay awards against the United States. Senior officials at the Justice Department had objected to sending cash on a plane to Iran at the same time that Iran was releasing four imprisoned Americans (the fifth American was released separately) but were overruled by the State Department, The Wall Street Journal reported in a separate story on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the discussions. ‚ÄúPeople knew what it was going to look like, and there was concern the Iranians probably did consider it a ransom payment,‚Äù the newspaper quoted one of the people as saying. Justice Department prosecutors were also concerned that the United States would release too many Iranian convicts and drop too many pending criminal cases against people suspected of violating sanctions laws, the second Wall Street Journal report said. Reuters was unable to independently verify the report. In response to the report, a Department of Justice spokesman said in a statement: ‚ÄúThe Department of Justice fully supported the ultimate outcome of the Administration‚Äôs resolution of several issues with Iran, including Hague settlement efforts, as well as the return of U.S. citizens detained in Iran. We will not comment further on internal interagency deliberations.‚Äù A senior State Department official also responded by saying that the payment had been fully an interagency decision and that any idea that the State Department had the power to overrule was false. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump blamed his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state during Obama‚Äôs first term, for launching the talks with Iran. ‚ÄúOur incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal!‚Äù Trump said in a Twitter post. The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, also weighed in. ‚ÄúThe Obama-Clinton foreign policy not only means cutting a dangerous nuclear deal with the world‚Äôs number one state sponsor of terrorism, it also means paying them a secret ransom with cargo planes full of cash,‚Äù he said. House Speaker Paul Ryan was more measured, saying, ‚ÄúIf true, this report confirms our longstanding suspicion that the administration paid a ransom in exchange for Americans unjustly detained in Iran.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 3, 2016 "
Fury at top of Republican Party over Trump snub of House speaker,"WASHINGTON/JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs White House campaign was in turmoil on Wednesday after he angered senior Republican Party leaders by criticizing a dead soldier‚Äôs family and refusing to back the re-election campaign of House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. On Tuesday, Trump denied support to both Ryan and Senator John McCain in their coming primary contests, hitting back at critics in the Republican leadership who have taken him to task for his insistent public dispute with the parents of the soldier, a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in the Iraq war.  Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was furious over the failure to endorse Ryan, who is the most senior elected Republican, and over Trump‚Äôs feud with the Khan family, two Republican sources said. ‚ÄúHe feels like a fool,‚Äù a Republican source familiar with the situation said of Priebus. The RNC did not respond to a request for comment about Priebus.  Another Republican source said Trump‚Äôs family members, who have played an influential role in his campaign, were aware that an intervention was needed to get Trump back on track. One idea being floated was to have a senior adviser travel with Trump to help him stay on message. More than any other major figure in the Republican establishment, Priebus worked to bring Trump into the party‚Äôs fold despite the New York businessman‚Äôs status as an outsider. Trump, who had never previously run for public office, beat 16 rivals to become the Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. Ahead of last month‚Äôs Republican Party Convention, the RNC chairman sought to rally the fractured party behind Trump. Priebus feels burned by Trump‚Äôs string of self-inflicted wounds and his refusal to observe basic decorum by giving Ryan his support. But in what appeared to be an effort to soothe ruffled feelings, Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, said on Wednesday he endorsed Ryan as ‚Äúa strong conservative leader‚Äù and was doing so with Trump‚Äôs blessing. The Indiana governor told Fox News that it takes time to build relationships in politics and that was exactly what Trump and Ryan were doing.  Trump has had a running dispute with the parents of Army Captain Humayun Khan since they took the stage at last week‚Äôs Democratic National Convention. Khizr Khan, with his wife, Ghazala, standing by his side, cited the sacrifice of their son, who was killed by a car bomb in 2004, and criticized Trump‚Äôs proposal to combat terrorism by temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States. Many Republican leaders, including Ryan and McCain, have criticized Trump‚Äôs subsequent attacks on the parents. Even longtime ally Chris Christie, the Republican New Jersey governor, said it was inappropriate to attack the Khans. Trump‚Äôs feud with the Khans was the final straw for Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger, a former Air Force pilot and Iraq war veteran. Kinzinger, who had held off supporting Trump, told CNN on Wednesday: ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt see how I get to Donald Trump anymore.‚Äù Trump, who made his comments about Ryan and McCain in an interview with The Washington Post, shrugged off the backlash. ‚ÄúThere is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H!‚Äù he wrote on Twitter early on Wednesday, referring to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Campaign manager Paul Manafort told Fox News the campaign was moving in a positive direction, with Trump himself in control. ‚ÄúThe campaign is in very good shape. We are organized. We are moving forward,‚Äù Manafort said. In Daytona, Florida, Trump said the news media‚Äôs coverage of him was dishonest. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing quite well despite the fact that we get a totally false narrative,‚Äù he told supporters at a rally. At another campaign event in Florida, in Jacksonville, Trump pointed out a group of families, known as Gold Star families, who have lost loved ones in war, calling them ‚Äúincredible people.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt mention the spat with the Khans. Trump‚Äôs always unruly campaign has been mired in disorder in recent days. On Monday, Trump fired Ed Brookover, a senior adviser hired as a liaison between the campaign and the RNC. Ryan, who is favored to win next week in his race against primary challenger Paul Nehlen, appeared to be trying to ignore the snub from Trump. An aide to the speaker said he would not have time to meet Trump later this week, when Trump is expected to be campaigning in Wisconsin, Ryan‚Äôs home state. The aide did not indicate whether anyone had requested a get-together of Trump and Ryan, but when asked whether they might meet to patch things up, the aide told Reuters, ‚ÄúThe speaker has a full schedule ‚Äì can‚Äôt back out of previous commitments in the (congressional) district.‚Äù A Republican congressional aide said there was deep frustration on Capitol Hill that Trump keeps engaging in ‚Äúpetty spats.‚Äù The aide said congressional offices that support Trump got two sets of talking points on Monday from the campaign about the Khan situation but have not heard anything from the campaign about Trump‚Äôs Ryan comments. The dissent over the Trump campaign also took other turns. Late on Tuesday, Meg Whitman, a prominent Republican fundraiser and chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), endorsed Clinton‚Äôs White House bid, calling Trump an ‚Äúauthoritarian character‚Äù and a threat to democracy. In better news for Trump, his campaign and the RNC jointly raised $80 million for his White House bid in July, the campaign said on Wednesday. That was less than the $90 million Clinton raised along with the national Democratic Party the same month, but it was a substantial bump from past months. A former reality TV star, Trump has won support particularly from white blue-collar workers who feel neglected by the political establishment. Along with his proposed ban on Muslims, his plans have included building a wall along the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants and renegotiating trade agreements. Opinion polls have shown Clinton benefiting from a boost after her party‚Äôs convention last week. The RealClearPolitics average of recent national polls put her 4.5 percentage points ahead of Trump, at 46.5 percent to 42 percent. The Detroit Economic Club, where candidates usually appear to give major economic addresses, said Trump would speak at the club on Monday. ",politicsNews,"August 3, 2016 "
Clinton extends lead over Trump to 8 percentage points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton extended her lead over Republican rival Donald Trump to eight percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from six points on Friday. The bump for Clinton followed the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week at which Clinton and her supporters painted an optimistic portrait of America, and came amid controversy over Trump‚Äôs comments about the parents of a slain Muslim U.S. soldier. About 43 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 9 percent picked ‚ÄúOther,‚Äù according to the July 28-Aug. 1 online poll of 1,289 likely voters. The poll had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.  Trump has faced a barrage of criticism in recent days from political allies as well as opponents after he criticized the parents of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. The father, Khizr Khan, had harsh words for Trump at the Democratic convention where he spoke on Thursday night, saying the 70-year-old businessman and former reality TV star had ‚Äúsacrificed nothing and no one‚Äù and railing against his calls to ban Muslim immigrants. Trump responded saying Khan ‚Äúviciously attacked‚Äù him, and suggested the man was repeating lines fed to him by the Clinton campaign. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who dropped out of the Republican presidential primary race and endorsed Trump, said on Tuesday that Trump‚Äôs criticisms of the Khans was ‚Äúinappropriate.‚Äù House Republican Richard Hanna of New York said it was ‚Äúnot enough to simply denounce his (Trump‚Äôs) comments,‚Äù and said he would support former Secretary of State Clinton instead. Trump had a short-lived bump in the polls after the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in late July, when Reuters polling showed him slightly ahead of Clinton for the first time since May.

Obama cuts short prison sentences for 214 convicts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama cut short the prison terms of 214 convicts on Wednesday, the largest number of commutations a U.S. leader has granted in single day since at least 1900, the White House said. Obama has now granted a total of 562 commutations during his presidency, more than the number by the past nine presidents combined, it said. In Wednesday‚Äôs batch, 67 convicts were serving life sentences. The convicts were serving time for crimes including possession of crack cocaine and methamphetamine, with intent to distribute. Some were imprisoned on charges of gun possession.  One of the convicts, James Wright of Baltimore, Maryland, was serving a 20 year sentence that began in 2006 for possession of crack with intent to distribute. He will be released in December. Obama has worked to reform the U.S. criminal justice system and reduce the number of people serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offences. It is a rare issue on which Obama gets support from Republican lawmakers. For years crack offenders faced stiffer penalties than powder cocaine offenders, even though the substances are similar at the molecular level. Critics have said the disparity has unfairly harmed minority and poor communities.   In 2014, Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years, inviting thousands of drug offenders and other convicts to seek early release. But the program has struggled under a flood of unprocessed cases.  ‚ÄúOur work is far from finished,‚Äù White House counsel Neil Eggleston said about the commutations. Eggleston urged Congress to take action. ‚ÄúWhile we continue to work to act on as many clemency applications as possible, only legislation can bring about lasting change to the federal system,‚Äù he said. The program automatically expires when Obama leaves office next January and it is uncertain whether the next president would continue with a similar plan. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 election, has championed ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù in his campaign. Democrat Hillary Clinton has called for criminal justice reform.

Clinton campaign studying alternative to U.S. ethanol mandate,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign has solicited advice from California regulators on how to revamp a federal regulation requiring biofuels like corn-based ethanol be blended into the nation‚Äôs gasoline supply, according to campaign and state officials. ¬†¬†¬† The move is the clearest sign yet that, if elected, Clinton would seek to adjust the regulation, called the Renewable Fuel Standard, possibly hurting her chances in corn-growing states like Iowa where she faces a tough battle against Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. The Renewable Fuel Standard, created by Congress in 2005, mandates that transportation fuel sold in the United States contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. It was intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and expand the U.S. renewable fuels sector while lowering reliance on imported oil. It is opposed by the oil industry and environmentalists and has been criticized as a mere subsidy to corn producers.  Clinton advisers have contacted the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss whether a policy like California‚Äôs Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a market-based system rather than a mandate, could be applied at a national level to replace or augment the Renewable Fuel Standard, and other issues, CARB officials said. Mary Nichols, head of the CARB, said she discussed the state‚Äôs regulations with Clinton advisers. While a backer of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Nichols said she told Clinton‚Äôs advisers they could avoid political backlash by focusing on other carbon-reduction strategies instead, such as expanding electric vehicle sales and cleaning up emissions from coal-fired electricity. Nichols did not provide further details on the discussions. A Clinton campaign official, who asked not to be named, confirmed the discussions with CARB but gave no further details.  A campaign spokesman, Tyrone Gayle, said the campaign has been seeking advice from ‚Äúa diverse set of stakeholders.‚Äù He added that the Clinton campaign ‚Äúdoes not support replacing the RFS with a national low-carbon fuel standard‚Äù but did not elaborate. Former Obama administration climate and energy adviser Heather Zichal said on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week that the Renewable Fuel Standard was broken, but that a Clinton administration could make ‚Äúmodifications‚Äù to fix it. ‚ÄúMandates aren‚Äôt necessarily a perfect way to regulate,‚Äù Zichal said at the event. The U.S. corn lobby hopes to convince both Clinton and Trump to uphold the regulation, which requires a doubling of U.S. biofuels use to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022, when congressionally mandated volume targets are set to expire. The program is designed to last indefinitely after that. Environmentalists, anti-hunger activists and the oil sector have called for the rule to be repealed or changed because they say it raises food and fuel costs without delivering the emissions reductions that it was intended to achieve. MARKET-BASED SYSTEM The California regulation, a key part of the state‚Äôs effort to combat climate change, requires a 10 percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2020, but leaves it up to companies¬†to decide how to reach that target. ¬†¬†¬† California enacted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in 2007 targeting oil refiners and distributors that sell in the state‚Äôs market. It angered Midwestern ethanol interests because the regulation counts the carbon dioxide footprint of transporting biofuels into the state for blending, effectively blocking many of those imports. Oil companies have complained that the regulation is costly. Clinton in May expressed support for the federal Renewable Fuel Standard in an opinion piece published in an Iowa newspaper, but said it could be improved. Clinton‚Äôs openness to overhauling the Renewable Fuel Standard appears to contrast with Trump‚Äôs position. During the state-by-state battle for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump said he supported the biofuel mandates set out in the Renewable Fuel Standard. Corn and ethanol industry lobbyists said they have been talking with both the Clinton and Trump campaigns to argue in favor of the Renewable Fuel Standard. ",politicsNews,"August 3, 2016 "
Muslim families of fallen U.S. soldiers driven to oppose Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nazar Naqvi has faithfully voted Republican for more than three decades.  After Donald Trump‚Äôs feud with Muslim parents who lost a son in battle for the United States, he has vowed not a single Republican will get his vote. Naqvi, 69, a retired U.S. government engineer from Newburgh, New York, is a member of a small community of Muslims who are among America‚Äôs Gold Star families, those whose loved ones were killed while serving in the U.S. military.  His son Mohsin Naqvi, who was born in Pakistan, enlisted in the U.S. Army four days after Sept. 11, 2001, and was killed in 2008 by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Trump lashed out at Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Pakistani American parents of slain U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, after they appeared at last week‚Äôs Democratic convention in Philadelphia to criticize the Republican presidential hopeful for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to vote for anyone but Republicans because of this one person, this man who has gone out of his mind,‚Äù Naqvi said this week. ‚ÄúNot any office should get our vote. He has been nominated not by one person - the Republican Party nominated him.‚Äù Naqvi said he was pressing his registered Republican friends to do the same.     The Pentagon says that 3,939 active duty service members have identified themselves as Muslim, less than 1 percent of the 1.3 million active duty U.S. military troops, but a Pentagon spokesman said there is no record of how many Muslims have been killed in action. Reuters reached out to a dozen Muslim Gold Star families who lost a loved one in action after Sept. 11, 2001. The families are not organized as a group and some did not  want to talk. But those who did agreed that Trump‚Äôs comments upended their political loyalties, and moved them to take action to register and motivate other voters to keep Trump out of the White House in November. Nooshin Razani, 43, an Iranian-American pediatrician in Oakland, California, whose 19-year-old brother Omead Razani died while serving as a U.S. Army medic in Iraq in 2004, said Trump‚Äôs comments sparked her to speak to the press for the first time. ‚ÄúWhen I saw there was this person who was willing to use religion in this negative way, I decided I‚Äôm coming forward,‚Äù said Razani. Trump rebuked Khizr Khan for suggesting that he should read the U.S. Constitution and said his wife Ghazala may have stood silently by her husband because she might not have been ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to speak. Although Trump did call their son a hero and said his aim was to end radical Islamic terror, the ensuing uproar has caused many Republicans to distance themselves from him and to support the Khan family.     Razani joined more than 20 Gold Star families in signing an open letter calling for Trump to apologize to the Khans and said she is going to volunteer to register voters, mainly because of Trump‚Äôs comments about Ghazala Khan, which she said insulted all Muslim women. ‚ÄúI want to be an active part of making sure people‚Äôs voices are heard. Even people Trump thinks don‚Äôt speak up,‚Äù Razani said. Trump‚Äôs ongoing dispute with the Khans has become a call to political action for Kevin Ahearn of Phoenix. His brother, Army Major James Ahearn, converted to Islam to marry a woman with whom he fell in love in Iraq, brought to the United States and with whom he had a daughter before he was killed by a bomb in Iraq in 2007.  Kevin Ahearn, 48, said on Tuesday that he and his husband planned to go to Democratic Headquarters in Phoenix to volunteer for the first time. ‚ÄúIt makes me all the more determined that he does not make it to the White House,‚Äù said Ahearn, whose Muslim niece now is 10. The soldier‚Äôs mother said she was shocked by Trump‚Äôs rhetoric and wishes she could talk to her late son about it. ‚ÄúHe was always a staunch Republican because they backed the military. I can‚Äôt imagine how he would feel now,‚Äù said Constance Ahearn, 75, who lives in the San Francisco area. ",politicsNews,"August 3, 2016 "

"Republican rift widens as Trump declines to endorse Ryan, McCain","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ratcheted up tensions in his party on Tuesday by denying two leading figures, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John McCain, support in their re-election bids. Trump told The Washington Post in an interview that he could endorse neither Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, nor McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona and a former Republican presidential nominee, as they face challenges in their states‚Äô primary contests ahead of the Nov. 8 general election. Both Ryan and McCain had criticized Trump‚Äôs feud with the family of Army Captain Humayun Khan, who died in the line of duty in Iraq in 2004 and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for bravery after his death. The discord comes just two weeks after the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that formally nominated Trump for president. It is the latest rift in a party already frayed by internal dissent over its standard bearer, seen in stark relief at the convention where McCain was among high-level party members who essentially snubbed Trump by choosing not to attend. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, and former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush also did not attend the convention. Trump has had a running dispute with Khizr and Ghazala Khan since they took the stage at last week‚Äôs Democratic convention to cite their son‚Äôs sacrifice and criticize Trump‚Äôs proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. The uproar has led many Republicans to distance themselves from Trump and voice support for the Khan family.    Trump, mirroring the language Ryan used about supporting the nominee before his eventual endorsement, told the newspaper he was ‚Äúnot quite there yet‚Äù on endorsing Ryan in next Tuesday‚Äôs Wisconsin primary, and that he had ‚Äúnever been there‚Äù with McCain, who will be on the ballot in primary elections in Arizona later this month. McCain had a ‚Äúvery friendly‚Äù meeting with Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, on Tuesday in Arizona, where Pence was visiting, a McCain spokeswoman said.¬† Trump said Ryan had sought his endorsement, but that as of now he is only ‚Äúgiving it very serious consideration.‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs campaign office quickly responded that ‚Äúneither Speaker Ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for Donald Trump‚Äôs endorsement.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd we are confident in a victory next week regardless,‚Äù campaign spokesman Zack Roday said in a statement.   Ryan is favored to win against primary challenger Paul Nehlen, who Trump praised as running ‚Äúa very good campaign.‚Äù In a mid-July survey by Harper Polling, Ryan was ahead of Nehlen by nearly 50 points. Trump, a former reality TV star, has troubled many in the Republican establishment with his off-the-cuff, often insulting style, and controversial policies, including the proposed ban on Muslims and his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants. President Barack Obama on Tuesday blasted Trump as unfit to be president and questioned why any Republican would support the New York businessman, who is seeking his first public office. ‚ÄúThe question I think that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable: Why are you still endorsing him?‚Äù Obama, a Democrat, said at a White House news conference with Singapore‚Äôs prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. The chorus of complaints against Trump grew on Tuesday. Representative Richard Hanna of New York became the first Republican in Congress to endorse Democratic nominee Hillary, although several other Republicans in Congress have said they will not support Trump. Hanna, who is retiring from the House of Representatives rather than seek re-election, said his decision was prompted by Trump‚Äôs attacks on the Khan family. He called Trump ‚Äúdeeply flawed in endless ways,‚Äù ‚Äúunrepentant‚Äù and ‚Äúself-involved.‚Äù New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Trump ally once viewed by Trump as a potential running mate, called criticisms of the Khan family ‚Äúinappropriate.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs son Eric told CBS News on Tuesday that his father‚Äôs comments about the Khans have been ‚Äúblown hugely out of proportion.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬†¬†Trump has fallen behind Clinton in opinion polls made public since the parties held their nominating conventions last month. Clinton extended her lead over Trump to 8 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from 6 points on Friday. About 43 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 9 percent picked ‚Äúother.‚Äù Trump also has trailed Clinton in fundraising. Clinton reported raising nearly $90 million in July for her campaign and the Democratic Party, with more than half the donations coming from new donors. Interviewed on the Fox Business television network, Trump brushed off billionaire investor Warren Buffett‚Äôs blistering critique of his business acumen. Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, scorned Trump‚Äôs 1995 move to list Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange, saying the business lost money for the next decade and that a monkey would have outperformed Trump‚Äôs company. Trump, who has said his business success qualifies him to lead the country, defended his record running his hotel and casino business in Atlantic City, New Jersey. ‚ÄúI had great timing.

Tea Party Republican Huelskamp loses re-election bid for U.S. House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, a Tea Party favorite who often feuded with Republican leaders in the U.S. House, lost his bid for re-election in the party‚Äôs primary contest, unofficial state results showed on Wednesday. Huelskamp, who was seeking a fourth term, won just 44 percent of Tuesday‚Äôs vote in losing to political newcomer Roger Marshall, a physician who took 57 percent, according to the Kansas secretary of state‚Äôs website. Marshall said Huelskamp had become an ineffective player in Washington after losing key committee positions in a stand-off with Republican leaders. Conservative political action committees spent heavily this year to defeat Huelskamp and support Marshall, who also was backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Huelskamp comes from a Kansas farm family and was elected to Congress in 2010 amid a wave of support from the Tea Party movement, which promotes smaller government and reduced federal spending and taxation. He repeatedly tangled with his House Republican leaders in pushing for a more conservative fiscal agenda.  Huelskamp was a prominent member of the Freedom Caucus of House conservatives who have riled House Republican leadership. His battles with former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner left him stripped of his House Budget and Agriculture Committee memberships, a blow to his farm-rich state. ‚ÄúVoters are looking for results from their Reps, not obstructionism,‚Äù the Chamber of Commerce‚Äôs political wing said in a tweet after the vote, calling Marshall an ‚Äúeffective conservative.‚Äù Huelskamp, in a post on Facebook overnight, said the race showed how big money from ‚ÄúWashington power brokers‚Äù had defeated Kansas values.  ‚ÄúIt is now perfectly clear,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúthat the Establishment wing of the Republican party cannot stand conservatives,‚Äù he wrote.

Trump campaign asks Capitol Hill to back him in Khan controversy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign appealed to Capitol Hill for support on Monday as his attacks on the Muslim parents of a decorated American soldier killed in Iraq drew sharp rebukes from fellow party members. Trump‚Äôs criticism of Khizr Khan and Ghazala Khan, who took the stage at last week‚Äôs Democratic convention, sparked growing concern and dismay from Republican lawmakers responding to the latest Trump outburst to blindside his party colleagues. Republican Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war and the most prominent veteran in Congress, along with the commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, joined the chorus of condemnation, reflecting the highly regarded place the military and its veterans hold with many in the United States. Trump‚Äôs dispute with the Khans has dominated the White House campaign in recent days and underlined the uneasy alliance between many leading Republicans and the party‚Äôs freewheeling, unorthodox nominee for the Nov. 8 election. Rob Wasinger, a onetime congressional candidate who has been working for the Trump camp on congressional outreach, sent an email to senior Senate aides saying, ‚ÄúWe want to get several member statements out today on this, and would really appreciate your help.‚Äù A similar appeal was made to Republicans in the House of Representatives, according to a senior aide. Attached to the appeal were talking points lawmakers could use to try to tamp down the controversy growing since last week‚Äôs appearance at the Democratic convention by the Khans, the parents of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said that the campaign was grateful to have support in Congress and that Republicans are working to keep Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from winning the presidency. Wasinger refused to comment when contacted by telephone. The appeal did not generate any help for Trump. A senior Senate Republican aide, who asked not to be identified, said Republican senators were pleased with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs statement on Sunday calling Captain Khan ‚Äúan American hero‚Äù and noting ‚Äúa travel ban on all members of a religion is simply contrary to American values.‚Äù At the same time, the aide said the controversy would probably not cause Republican senators to withdraw their endorsements of Trump. In a convention speech delivered with his wife at his side, Khizr Khan showcased his son‚Äôs military service and criticized Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslims from entering the United States, holding up a copy of the U.S. Constitution and suggesting Trump read it. Since then, Trump has complained he was ‚Äúviciously‚Äù attacked by the couple and suggested Ghazala Khan might not have been ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to speak, implying her silence reflected restrictions placed on women by some traditional Muslims.  McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate and current chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a lengthy statement sharply criticizing Trump‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúWhile our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,‚Äù said McCain, a prisoner of war for five years during the Vietnam War. His counterpart on the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, echoed McCain, saying in a statement he was ‚Äúdismayed at the attacks Khizr and Ghazala Khan have endured after they spoke about their son‚Äôs service and sacrifice.‚Äù The head of the 1.7 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars also said Trump‚Äôs attack on the Khans went too far. Trump and Clinton spoke to the group‚Äôs national convention last week. ‚ÄúElection year or not, the VFW will not tolerate anyone berating a Gold Star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression,‚Äù said Brian Duffy, the national commander of the country‚Äôs oldest and largest war veterans organization, referring to families who have lost relatives in wars. President Barack Obama did not mention Trump by name, but said military families who had lost loved ones in service should be honored for their sacrifice. ‚ÄúNo one has given more for our freedom and our security than our Gold Star families,‚Äù Obama said at the Disabled American Veterans national convention in Atlanta. ‚ÄúOur Gold Star families have made a sacrifice that most of us cannot even begin to imagine. They represent the very best of our country.‚Äù In the talking points sent to lawmakers, the Trump campaign said he had been asked about the Khans‚Äô comments during the convention and wished them well. The talking points also noted that Trump ‚Äúwants to end radical Islamic terror, so that our soldiers like Mr. Khan‚Äôs son will be safe.‚Äù The list also says Trump had not directly compared his sacrifices to the Khans. Trump said over the weekend he had also made sacrifices in his life by working hard, creating jobs and being successful. The Khans bristled at that suggestion and, in numerous television appearances over the weekend, said Trump was ignorant about Islam and about their family‚Äôs sacrifice.   Trump‚Äôs off-the-cuff insults and controversial proposals such as the Muslim ban and a plan to keep illegal immigrants out by building a wall along the Mexican border, have made many in the party establishment reluctant backers of his White House bid. On Monday, during a town hall event in Columbus, Ohio, Trump told supporters he thought the November election might be ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù Later that day, he said former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders ‚Äúmade a deal with the devil‚Äù when he agreed to back Clinton. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the devil,‚Äù Trump said, referring to Clinton. In his statement, McCain recalled how Humayun Khan died, saying that when a suicide bomber aimed his vehicle toward a building housing hundreds of U.S. soldiers, the captain told his subordinates to stay away, then ran toward it. McCain thanked the Khans for coming to America, saying ‚Äúyour son was the best of America, and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation ‚Äì and he will never be forgotten.‚Äù  In a remarks to television networks on Monday, Khizr Khan said Trump lacked the empathy to be a leader and chided him for throwing the first salvo in their exchange. Trump has tried to shift focus from the Khans. ‚ÄúThis story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!‚Äù Trump said Monday on Twitter. Ghazala Khan wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Sunday saying she had remained silent during her husband‚Äôs remarks to cope with making her grief public during the convention. On Sunday, Democratic rival Clinton said Trump had scapegoated the parents. In addition to Senate Majority Leader McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement supporting the family.  Trump drew similar opprobrium a year ago when he said McCain, who as a naval aviator was shot down and taken prisoner during the Vietnam War, was not a hero because he had been captured. In an open letter, 23 Gold Star families said Trump cheapened their sacrifice and called for an apology. ‚ÄúThis goes beyond politics. It is about a sense of decency,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúThat kind decency you mock as ‚Äòpolitical correctness.‚Äô‚Äù ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2016 "
Obama to Republican leaders: why are you still endorsing Trump?,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama issued a scathing attack of Donald Trump on Tuesday for criticizing a Muslim family whose U.S. Army captain son was killed in Iraq, and he challenged Republican leaders to withdraw support for their ‚Äúunfit‚Äù nominee. Obama‚Äôs comments added to a growing number of statements from Republicans and Democrats lambasting Trump for his criticism of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who appeared at the Democratic National Convention last week. Trump questioned whether Mrs. Khan did not speak at the convention because she was prevented from doing so by her religion and he characterized Mr. Khan‚Äôs criticism of him as ‚Äúvicious.‚Äù Families who lose sons or daughters who serve in the U.S. military are called Gold Star families. ‚ÄúThe notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf or our country, the fact that he doesn‚Äôt appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia means that he‚Äôs woefully unprepared to do this job,‚Äù Obama said of Trump during a White House news conference. The Democratic president noted that leading Republicans, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, and one-time Republican presidential nominee John McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona, had criticized Trump for his remarks but have stood by their endorsements of him. ‚ÄúThe question I think that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?‚Äù Obama said.  ‚ÄúWhat does this say about your party that this is your standard-bearer?‚Äù Obama said. Obama spoke during a White House news conference with Singapore‚Äôs prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong.  Obama has endorsed his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president. Obama said that even if he had lost his White House races in 2008 to McCain and in 2012 to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, he would not have doubted their abilities to lead the country. That was not the case for Trump, a businessman from New York, Obama said. ‚ÄúThere has to come a point at which you say, somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn‚Äôt have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world,‚Äù Obama said.

Trump loses bid to end Trump University lawsuit before trial,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs pretrial bid to throw out a lawsuit brought by Trump University students who said they were defrauded by its real-estate seminars. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said in a written ruling that there was a ‚Äúgenuine issue of material fact‚Äù as to whether Trump knowingly participated in a scheme to cheat the students, who paid up to $35,000 to learn Trump‚Äôs real estate investing ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù from his ‚Äúhand-picked‚Äù instructors. Curiel said there was extensive evidence Trump had not personally met, interviewed or selected Trump University instructors. In a July 22 hearing, Curiel tentatively denied the bid by Trump to dismiss the lawsuit in California, one of three over the defunct Trump University venture. Trump‚Äôs lawyers had argued that the lawsuit, filed in 2013 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, should be dismissed because the New York real estate mogul, though personally involved in developing the concept and curriculum, relied on others to manage Trump University by the time the plaintiffs purchased seminars. Trump‚Äôs lawyers claimed that references in marketing materials to ‚Äúsecrets,‚Äù ‚Äúhand-picked‚Äù instructors or ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù were sales ‚Äúpuffery‚Äù and there was no evidence Trump intended to defraud students. Separately, Curiel rejected an effort to make public video excerpts of Trump testifying under oath.  Trump‚Äôs lawyers had fought against the release of the excerpts, saying they would be exploited by the media and others during the presidential campaign. Trump set off an uproar in May when he accused Curiel of being biased against him because of the candidate‚Äôs pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Curiel was born in Indiana and is of Mexican descent. ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 "
Trump ally Christie calls criticisms of slain soldier's family 'inappropriate',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chris Christie, a close ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, distanced himself on Tuesday from Trump‚Äôs feud with the Muslim family of a slain U.S. Army captain, according to Politico. Christie, the governor of New Jersey, said criticisms of the family of Captain Humayan Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004, were ‚Äúinappropriate.‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see Mr. Khan‚Äôs speech at the DNC, but I‚Äôll just say this: I‚Äôm a father and I just cannot imagine the pain of losing a child under any circumstances,‚Äù said Christie, who endorsed Trump after ending his own White House bid, according to Politico, which quoted Christie‚Äôs comments from a news conference at the New Jersey State House in Trenton.

Senior Democratic National Committee officials resign: DNC,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three senior officials with the Democratic National Committee have resigned, the DNC said on Tuesday, amid a shake-up following a hack of thousands of emails that embarrassed the party just as it staged its national convention last week. The resignations of DNC Chief Executive Officer Amy Dacey, Communications Director Luis Miranda and Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall were announced by interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile. Brazile, who took over the role after Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepped down last week, did not mention the hacks or give a reason for the resignations in a statement on the reorganization, but cast the changes as looking ahead to the U.S. general election on Nov. 8. The hack on the DNC emails stirred discord at the start of the party‚Äôs convention in Philadelphia where Hillary Clinton formally accepted her party‚Äôs presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Some of the emails, which were published by WikiLeaks, showed party officials favoring Clinton over her rival for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, during the primary contests. Brazile announced a transition team that she said would help to position the party for the general election and to prepare for an eventual permanent party chair.      Tom McMahon, a former executive director of the DNC, will lead the transition team, the statement said. Chief of Staff Brandon Davis will also continue in that role and will oversee DNC general election efforts, and strategist Doug Thornell will join as a senior adviser on an interim basis, it said. Other Democratic Party systems have also been hacked. The FBI is investigating a cyber attack incident at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, and a computer network used by Clinton‚Äôs campaign was also hacked. The White House has declined to speculate on who was behind the hack of Democratic Party computers, referring to an ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Cybersecurity experts and U.S. officials, however, have said they believed Russia engineered the release of the DNC emails to influence the presidential election. Clinton herself has blamed Russia for the hack. Russia‚Äôs foreign ministry has called such accusations  insulting.   ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 "

Clinton accuses Trump of scapegoating Muslim soldier's parents,"CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump on Sunday of scapegoating the parents of a Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, after the Republican nominee took issue with remarks the soldier‚Äôs father made at the Democratic National Convention. Trump, in an ABC interview that aired on Sunday, questioned why Ghazala Khan, mother of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, stood quietly by her husband, Khizr Khan, as he took the stage at last week‚Äôs Democratic convention in Philadelphia. Trump suggested the mother might not have been ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to speak. Speaking at a church service, Clinton said Trump had been insulting to a family who had sacrificed so much. She also used the episode to contrast her own religious faith with that of Trump, who has spoken of religion on the campaign trail infrequently. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt begrudge anyone of any other faith or of no faith at all, but I do tremble before those who would scapegoat other Americans, who would insult people because of their religion, their ethnicity, their disability,‚Äù Clinton said in remarks at the Imani Temple Ministries, an African-American church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not how I was raised, that‚Äôs not how I was taught in my church,‚Äù said Clinton, who grew up as a Methodist. ‚ÄúTim Kaine and I are people of faith,‚Äù she said, referring to her vice presidential running mate, who is a Catholic. Top Republican lawmakers House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also condemned Trump‚Äôs remarks in separate statements, although they did not mention their presidential candidate by name. ‚ÄúMany Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example,‚Äù Ryan said. ‚ÄúHis sacrifice - and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan - should always be honored. Period.‚Äù he said. Earlier on Sunday, Ghazala Khan took up her own defense in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, saying her husband had asked her in advance whether she would want to speak at the convention but that she had decided she would be unable to do so on stage because of her pain over the 2004 death of her son. ‚ÄúDonald Trump said that maybe I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say anything. That is not true,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWhen Donald Trump is talking about Islam, he is ignorant.‚Äù In a statement issued on Sunday evening by the Trump campaign, Trump‚Äôs running mate, Mike Pence, said that he and the Republican nominee ‚Äúbelieve that Captain Humayun Khan is an American hero‚Äù that his family, like other families of fallen soldiers, ‚Äúshould be cherished by every American.‚Äù But Pence added that Captain Khan had died defending the country against terrorism and that Trump‚Äôs policies would reduce the likelihood that other families would face the kind of heartbreak the Khans had. Khizr Khan, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin and a Muslim, spoke about his war hero son at the Democratic convention and took issue with Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States. Khizr Khan invited the Republican nominee to read the U.S. Constitution and visit the graves of American soldiers from many backgrounds at Arlington National Cemetery. In the interview aired on Sunday morning on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week,‚Äù Trump cast doubt on why Khan‚Äôs wife did not speak. ‚ÄúShe was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably, maybe she wasn‚Äôt allowed to have anything to say. You tell me,‚Äù Trump said. Trump on Sunday tweeted that Khan‚Äôs son had died 12 years ago: ‚ÄúCaptain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ‚Äúleaders‚Äù to eradicate it!‚Äù  Trump also tweeted that he had been ‚Äúviciously attacked‚Äù by Khan at the convention. ‚ÄúAm I not allowed to respond?‚Äù he asked. The candidate also tried to change the subject to the war itself: ‚ÄúHillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!‚Äù On Twitter, Republican strategist Ana Navarro called Trump‚Äôs comments about the Khans ‚Äúgross‚Äù and labeled him a ‚Äújerk.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said he sympathizes with the Khan family but that their loss is not the issue at hand. ‚ÄúThe issue really is radical Islamic jihad and the risk to the American homeland,‚Äù he said on CBS, defending Trump‚Äôs proposal to suspend immigration from some geographic regions.

Powerful Koch brothers rebuff big donors' calls to back Trump for White House,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - The billionaire industrialist Koch brothers rejected pressure over the weekend from dozens of big donors in their sprawling political network to back U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying that their money was better spent trying to influence congressional races. The rejection deprives Trump, a New York businessman who has never previously run for elected office, of a major source of fundraising and reflects how his unorthodox White House bid has sparked some disarray among fundraisers who would normally be squarely behind a Republican nominee. The Kochs, with a nearly $300 million political warchest,  have earned a reputation as powerful allies in Republican politics.  Charles Koch, the dominant player in his political partnership with brother David Koch, told attendees at a bi-annual donor retreat at a luxury resort in Colorado Springs, Colorado: ‚ÄúAt this point, I can‚Äôt support either candidate‚Äù for the White House.  He said network‚Äôs mandate was to shore up ‚Äúthe country‚Äôs financial future and eliminate corporate welfare,‚Äù a reference to government subsidies provided to some industries. ‚ÄúBut since it appears that neither presidential candidate is likely to support us in these efforts, we are focused on maximizing the number of principled leaders in the House and Senate who will,‚Äù he said.  Trump‚Äôs protectionist stances and pledges to review free trade agreements and to get tough on immigration have clashed with the Kochs‚Äô free-market political philosophy. Charles Koch has described as a ‚Äúa blood libel‚Äù the idea he would instead support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. A group of wealthy Republican donors, who paid the minimum $100,000 per year to be members of the 700-strong Koch network, had been urging the brothers to step off the sidelines of the election and back Trump. The donors argued that if Trump is elected, the Koch network would want to have influence on his emerging policies and cabinet picks, and to have access to a Trump administration. Over cocktails on the patio overlooking the Rocky Mountains, in private meetings and on text message threads, some donors voiced their concern that if the Kochs alienate Trump, ‚Äúit could hurt us down the road.‚Äù¬†  Some suggested that some donors could leave the Koch network over the decision not to back Trump. Oil magnate Harold Hamm, a leading candidate to serve as Trump‚Äôs energy secretary, did not attend the weekend gathering. Other donors who had been at the forefront of a movement to urge the Kochs to get on board with Trump, like billionaire broadcasting magnate Stanley Hubbard, said that in a private meeting with Charles, they had now been convinced that the Kochs were ‚Äúdoing the right thing.‚Äù   Trump has shown no hesitation in spurning the Kochs. On Friday, he tweeted that he had turned down an invitation to meet with the brothers. Koch insiders quickly disputed that characterization, saying an invite was never extended.   ¬†¬†¬†¬†Nonetheless, the Koch brothers also did not act to stop Trump from beating 16 presidential rivals and winning the party nomination. During the primary contests, many Koch donors were urging the brothers to perform a ‚ÄúTrump Intervention,‚Äù whereby the brothers would leverage their political operation to support Trump‚Äôs rivals. The Kochs refused. Trump officially accepted the Republican nomination in Cleveland last month, with a speech that painted a bleak picture of rising crime at home and increasing threats from overseas. The top Koch official on criminal justice reform, Mark Holden, said the speech was inaccurate. ‚ÄúWe are safer (now),‚Äù he said. ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2016 "
Factbox: Gold Stars mark sacrifices of U.S. military families,"(Reuters) - A war of words between Donald Trump and the parents of a Muslim U.S. soldier killed in Iraq in 2004 is dominating the election campaign.  Khizr and Ghazala Khan were criticized by the Republican presidential candidate after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention last Thursday and shared the story of their son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan. The Khans are what is known in the United States as a ‚ÄúGold Star Family,‚Äù meaning they have lost an immediate relative in a military action. The gold star refers to the centerpiece of flags given to these families. On Monday, more than 20 Gold Star Families wrote to Trump condemning his treatment of the couple, saying he was ‚Äúcheapening the sacrifice‚Äù of soldiers who have died and demanding that he apologize to the Khans.   The following are some facts about Gold Star Families: * What are Gold Star Families?  Gold Star Families have lost a member of their immediate family in a war or other conflict while serving with the U.S. military. The military awards each family an official flag bearing a gold star or a lapel pin with a gold star on a purple background.  Called a service flag, families with relatives on active duty display a flag with a blue star.   * History of Gold Star Families Grace Seibold, whose son was killed in Europe in 1918 during World War One, founded a group that came to be known as American Gold Star Mothers for women who lost sons in the war. In the same year, President Woodrow Wilson approved a suggestion to let U.S. women wear a gold gilt star on a traditional black mourning arm band signifying their loss. In 1936, the United States began observing Gold Star Mothers Day on the last Sunday of September. An organization called The Gold Star Wives was formed before the end of World War Two, and the Gold Star Lapel Button was created in 1947. The term Gold Star Families was widely used after World War Two. * Different Service Flags A blue star signifies a relative serving in the military while a gold star means a family member has died in service. During World War One, relatives of active duty service members flew service flags bearing a blue star. As the gold star tradition took hold, families covered the blue star with a gold one to symbolize their loss. These flags were often hung in windows.  * How many Gold Star Families are there? The National Gold Star Family Registry notes on its website that 472,045 fallen service members have been registered by relatives. here * Which families wrote to Trump?  Monday‚Äôs letter to Trump was signed by relatives of U.S. service members killed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and Korea.  ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2016 "
"The Big Squeeze: This election year, it‚Äôs all about the money","MIDDLETOWN, CONN. - Two years ago, Judy Konopka and Craig Diangelo lost their jobs in the IT department of what was then known as Northeast Utilities, a regional electricity provider, when the company decided to replace about 220 employees with guest workers from India. In order to receive a more lucrative separation package, they had to train their foreign replacements both here and overseas.  Both had trouble finding new work. Konopka, 56, is still looking. Diangelo, 64, is working as a contractor for a company that provides no benefits, making substantially less than he did before. He views himself as a victim of globalization, a casualty of offshoring‚Äîand he credits Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who has cast himself as the champion of displaced and disaffected U.S. workers, for bringing the issue to light.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll vote for him,‚Äù says Diangelo, over dinner at a Thai restaurant on this town‚Äôs Main Street. Two others at the table murmur in assent.  He continues, his voice rising: ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt planning on retiring early. I wasn‚Äôt planning on making $35,000 less. I‚Äôve had to cut back a lot. I basically live paycheck to paycheck.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI could never vote for Hillary Clinton,‚Äù Diangelo says, citing Clinton‚Äôs support of the North American Free Trade Agreement, passed while her husband, Bill, was president, as well as her advocacy of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact that‚Äôs still being negotiated by the Obama administration. (Challenged by Bernie Sanders, Clinton has since retracted her support of TPP.) Even Konopka, who favors Clinton (she calls Trump ‚Äúthe biggest idiot‚Äù), has to admit Clinton‚Äôs support of trade deals such as NAFTA gives her pause. When Northeast Utilities fired her after 21 years, ‚ÄúI felt betrayed.‚Äù Konopka took advantage of a federal trade assistance program to improve her skills in web design, then discovered she couldn‚Äôt compete with designers outside the country who were willing to work for much less. Now, to get by, she sells vintage books on the web. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs starting to get really scary,‚Äù she says.  This presidential election is, purportedly, the Year of the Angry Voter, with images of scuffles at Trump rallies occupying cable-news screens. But as befitting someone who lives in a place called Middletown, Konopka is more typical of voters: consumed by a stomach-churning uncertainty, a vague sense of something lost, and an inescapable belief that an array of powerful forces‚Äîcorporations, politicians, government‚Äîaren‚Äôt looking out for them.  Economists and pundits have been struggling to explain why, with unemployment below 5 percent and a bounty of positive economic indicators, voters seem so dismayed, so distrustful. It might be something as simple as bargaining power.  In his best-known book, The Art of the Deal, Trump advises every negotiator to ‚Äúuse your leverage.‚Äù But increasingly, U.S. workers, white-and blue-collar alike, feel they have none. They‚Äôve seen their power erode as they are tossed into a global labor pool, as companies consolidate and shed jobs to please Wall Street, as unions wither, state budgets tighten, technology advances and iconic brands such as Nabisco pack up and move to Mexico.  The squeeze is on.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a feeling among workers that not only are they replaceable, but that they will be replaced,‚Äù says Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in nearby Worcester, Massachusetts. ‚ÄúThat there is no security anymore, that someone is making a profit by letting them go.‚Äù  ‚ÄúTrump,‚Äù he adds, ‚Äúhas tapped into that very well.‚Äù  According to Reuters/Ipsos polling, 71 percent of Trump supporters either have had to take a lower-paying job in the last few years, have a family member who has had to do so, or have a family member whose home has been threatened by foreclosure. In a sign of how widespread the phenomenon has become, 63 percent of Clinton supporters reported the same dismal tally.  ‚ÄúPeople feel more insecure about trade than terrorism,‚Äù Chaison tells me. ‚ÄúEveryone knows someone who has lost their job.‚Äù  What bothers Diangelo most is that he was let go by a company that still valued his skill‚Äîjust not him. ‚ÄúThe sad part is that my job is still there,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt go away. I went away.‚Äù  None of this should feel particularly new. The United States has been bleeding middle-class workers‚Äîespecially in the industrial and manufacturing sectors‚Äîas long as Bruce Springsteen has been around to sing about it. Candidates adorned with hard hats vowing to bring back factory jobs have become a set-piece of modern politics.  The United States has lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the past 15 years as the trade deficit has mushroomed, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington. Wage growth in almost all sectors has flatlined over that time, including for the bottom 70 percent of fouryear college graduates‚Äîand growth overall has been anemic, at under 2 percent. And while the 9 million jobs vaporized in the flash of the Great Recession have been recovered, the majority of them are of lesser quality than the ones they replaced.  Perhaps most fundamentally, the relationship between employee and employer has shifted. Workers‚Äô share of the pie has decreased substantially since the 1970s, when the country‚Äôs corporate and industrial base began to erode. Last year, workers‚Äô share dropped to 75.5 percent of corporate income, even as technology has made workforces more productive and efficient. U.S. corporate profits, meantime, returned to pre-recession levels in 2012. Workers ‚Äúsense that the recovery is only partial. It helps employers more than it helps workers,‚Äù Chaison says.  If workers‚Äô sense of slippage seems familiar, the way their discontent is rippling through our politics feels newly transformative. Voters threw out the Republicans running Congress in 2006, then two years later elected the first African-American president, an outsider who vowed reform. Souring on him, they replaced Democrats then controlling Congress with another set of Republicans in 2010 and 2014, making governance as unstable as the business sector. In a period of war, terrorism and economic chaos, all that churn might best be viewed as a deeply frustrated electorate trying to use what little leverage they have to change a system they consider to be otherwise unaccountable.  Trump has been the main beneficiary of that frustration. He makes those in the crowd feel like they matter, that they finally have a bully of their own who can push back at what they view as an alliance of unprincipled corporate culture and an enabling government. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking at a situation where the jobs are being ripped out of our states, out of our country, like candy from a baby,‚Äù Trump said at a rally this spring.  It has been Trump, along with Democrat Sanders, who has pushed the issue of job losses to countries such as China, Mexico and India to the forefront. Trump has threatened to slap a tax on imports and tear up trade deals. In Indiana earlier this year, he ripped air conditioner manufacturer Carrier for announcing it would lay off 2,100 workers and move its operations to Mexico. He gave Nabisco the same treatment, pledging he would no longer eat Oreos. He has slammed companies such as Apple and Boeing for their overseas operations, as well.  Few presidential candidates have such temerity to challenge well-known American brands, but clearly it is resonating. ‚ÄúThey might not like everything he says, but they believe he says what he thinks,‚Äù Lewis Gossett, president of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance, told me last summer. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre repeating a time in history when the very rich are removed from the very poor.‚Äù  Michael Smith is one of the Americans Trump rallies for. Smith was among 600 Nabisco employees laid off at the bakery on Chicago‚Äôs South Side earlier this year, after the company announced it was transferring some work to Mexico. He got the news at 3 a.m. ‚ÄúIt was,‚Äù Smith tells me, ‚Äúa dark night when all your livelihood passes in front of you, and you feel like you‚Äôve been given the royal shaft.‚Äù  Smith operated the machines that wrapped Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers. With overtime, he could clear $85,000 a year. He‚Äôs 59 and wasn‚Äôt thinking he would have to re-enter the job market.  The day before, Smith had shown up at a shareholders meeting in Chicago to confront Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Mondelez International, the holding company that oversees the Nabisco brand, about the move to Mexico. While sympathetic, Rosenfeld said it was her duty to maximize the corporation‚Äôs value to its shareholders worldwide by cutting costs.  ‚ÄúThere are two types of CEO mindsets,‚Äù Smith responded, ‚Äúthose who care about shareholders and those who care about the shareholders and the people.‚Äù  In our conversation, Smith didn‚Äôt begrudge the company‚Äôs legal right to relocate the jobs, but he questions a CEO who earned more than $40 million in compensation over the last two years exhorting the virtues of cost-cutting to a room full of laid-off blue-collar workers. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not good citizenship,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWealth comes from the workers. That profitability comes from us.‚Äù  Clinton met with a small group of the Nabisco workers in March, the day before the Illinois primary. But the visit didn‚Äôt leave Smith with much hope that as president she could do much either for the workers‚Äô situation or to reverse the demands of a globalized economy. In part, that‚Äôs due to Clinton‚Äôs support of NAFTA, which Smith terms an ‚Äúinfection,‚Äù but also because of the lobbying might of Mondelez, a $30 billion company, and other big corporations.  Smith is the unusual American voter who says he hasn‚Äôt decided between Clinton and Trump. He‚Äôll focus on the election later. First, he has to keep his household afloat and his daughter in school at Columbia College in Chicago. He has six months‚Äô salary to cushion him.  He‚Äôs trying to stay optimistic about finding work, saying his wife and daughter are counting on him. But, he concedes, ‚ÄúI think I have been a little bit in denial. Even people of faith have bouts of depression.‚Äù  Angela Valero gives a one-word reply when I ask her about a potential Clinton-Trump matchup: ‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù I might as well be asking about who‚Äôs going to win the next regatta on Mars, so far is the election from her daily concerns.  Valero‚Äôs dream job was to be a corrections officer. She was finally hired on by the state of Connecticut last fall. The single mother of an 8-year-old girl thought that, at last, she had a reliable, stable position with benefits.  But after completing an academy training course and being posted as a guard at the state maximum-security facility in nearby Uncasville, she found out this spring that she was being laid off, a consequence of a decision made by Connecticut‚Äôs Democratic governor, Dannel Malloy, and the state legislature to not raise taxes on the wealthy to cover a budget shortfall. Lawmakers worried that the state‚Äôs richest residents would relocate to Florida, which has no state income tax, or other states with lower taxes.  During the downturn, Connecticut lost a bevy of high-paying jobs in the financial services sector in the corporate hub of Stamford and elsewhere. The jobs created during the recovery were less lucrative, resulting in lower tax revenue. In addition, the state was spooked when General Electric, responding to an effort by the legislature to raise business taxes, announced it was relocating its headquarters from Fairfield to Boston. Aetna, the health insurer based in Hartford, also threatened to leave the state.  That shelved any notion of new taxes. The state looked to trim its public workforce instead. ‚ÄúEasy targets,‚Äù says Lori Pelletier, president of the state AFL-CIO.  Rape counselors, child-service workers, prison guards began receiving pink slips. Ultimately, 2,500 or more state workers could be let go. Pelletier contrasted that with the 200 jobs GE is moving to Boston‚Äîsomething that drew substantial media attention.  The state of Massachusetts and the city of Boston helped recruit GE with a generous benefit package, including $25 million in property tax relief for a corporation that critics have long held pays little in U.S. taxes. ‚ÄúAngela last year paid more taxes than GE,‚Äù Pelletier says. ‚ÄúAnd she‚Äôs the one losing her job.‚Äù  Valero tells me she has little faith that anyone in Washington can help her. She doesn‚Äôt sleep more than four hours a night, kept up by worrying about paying the electric bill and keeping her house. She has no idea whether she‚Äôll ever be recalled to work.  Throughout the interview, she stays stoic, determined, like the corrections office she was trained to be. Only at the end of our conversation does she slip a bit. ‚ÄúI held back the tears,‚Äù she says with relief.  Ron Ozer greets me at the door with the sheepishness of someone who isn‚Äôt used to being at home during the workday. Ozer, 53, was laid off from DuPont Co. in January after a 23-year career. A Ph.D in chemical engineering, he has more than 20 patents to his name. He worked on long-term projects at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware, one of the more storied research facilities in the country, where products such as nylon, Lycra and Kevlar were created.  ‚ÄúSome of the great developments in American industry came out of that site,‚Äù Ozer says. ‚ÄúIt was a time when America was growing so dramatically.‚Äù  But a lack of growth and pressure from investors forced DuPont to announce a merger with another giant, Dow Chemical. In advance of the merger, it has begun to shed jobs. In Delaware alone, DuPont plans to dump 1,700 workers‚Äîmany in the area of long-term research, which can be expensive without yielding immediate rewards to shareholders. Ozer‚Äôs group was eviscerated.  The $130 billion merger of DuPont and Dow blends two U.S. companies that date back to the 19th century. Barry Lynn, an economist at the New America think tank, says that industry consolidation chills the labor market, sapping demand for skilled workers such as Ozer. Dominant companies can use their market power to charge customers more or make suppliers pay less‚Äîall without having to grow and create jobs to survive. Indeed, the push from Wall Street is to cull and cut, not grow. And when companies do expand today it‚Äôs largely through acquisition, not investment.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a huge amount of the energy that‚Äôs behind Trump,‚Äù Lynn says, ‚Äúthe sense of power being consolidated and being out of control and harming me and my family and my community.‚Äù  Ozer will try to take advantage of his contacts at DuPont to become a consultant, but admits that‚Äôs a gamble. Asked if he thinks he can replicate the six-figure salary he enjoyed at DuPont, he laughs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not confident of that.‚Äù  His chief concern is his two daughters, both of whom are out of college. In order to give his youngest a leg up in the market, he sent her to private Haverford College in Pennsylvania (tuition: $46,000)‚Äîgoing deep into debt to do so. ‚ÄúI have a lot of possibilities, but I need things to start turning into dollars soon,‚Äù he says.  For Sara Blackwell, representing U.S. workers displaced by the federal H1-B visa program began as a gig. Now, it‚Äôs a full-blown cause.  The Tampa lawyer has been giving away clients who would distract her from her work. She jokes she‚Äôs stopped sleeping and exercising. Recently, she launched a website called ProtectUSworkers.com. ‚ÄúI speak to an average of 10 people a day who are victims of this,‚Äù she tells me. ‚ÄúThe more I learn about this, the more I have to fight.‚Äù  She began by representing IT workers at Walt Disney World in Florida who were replaced by guest workers from India brought in on temporary visas by outsourcing firms that contracted with Disney. She has filed a long-shot conspiracy lawsuit in federal court.  Blackwell contends that the practice of outsourcing low-end, back-office IT jobs to cut costs has become endemic. Globalization, she says, is systematically lowering the standard of living of American workers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a race to the bottom,‚Äù she says.  The Disney case garnered the attention of some in the U.S. Senate, including Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama who now is at the forefront of a fight against the American tech industry, which wants to expand the guest-worker program citing a lack of domestic qualified engineers and programmers.  But those tech companies are at the back of the line. According to Ron Hira, a professor at Howard University who tracks applications, outsourcing firms have been crowding out tech companies in the race to acquire the highly coveted H1-B visas, which are capped at 85,000 a year.  Sessions, who is also a fierce opponent of immigration reform, was one of the first U.S. politicians to embrace Trump‚Äîand Blackwell has spoken out against the program at several Trump rallies.  She also has consulted with the outsourced employees who worked at Northeast Utilities in Connecticut, including Craig Diangelo.

White House candidate Clinton sees big boost in fundraising in July,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raised nearly $90 million in July for her campaign and the Democratic Party, with more than half the donations coming from new donors, the campaign said on Tuesday. Clinton‚Äôs campaign said it had $58 million in the bank as it starts August, and that the donations it received last month averaged $44. Of the $90 million raised, $63 million was for Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign while about $26 million was for other Democrats, it said in a statement. In June, Clinton, the Democratic nominee raised $68.5 million. The campaign credited last week‚Äôs Democratic National Convention with the boost in fundraising in July. It said its best 24-hour period for online fundraising began Thursday night when Clinton accepted the party‚Äôs nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The campaign said it raised $8.7 million during that period. In a fundraising email to supporters, the Clinton campaign stressed it could not take a single vote for granted as it seeks to make history in November with the election of the first woman to be U.S. president. ‚ÄúIf we underestimate our opponent or take this race for granted, we‚Äôll lose,‚Äù the email said, referring to Republican nominee Donald Trump.

"Briton in Trump gun incident could die in U.S. prison, mother says","LONDON (Reuters) - A British man detained in the United States for allegedly trying to wrestle a gun from a police officer at a Donald Trump rally is suffering from severe mental illness and risks dying in prison, his mother said on Tuesday. Michael Sandford, 20, is due to face trial in Nevada on Aug. 22. He has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and one felony count of impeding and disrupting the orderly conduct of government business. His mother, Lynne Sandford, told a news conference in London that her son, who has been diagnosed in the past with autism, depression and other mental health conditions, had been on suicide watch in a Nevada prison for the past three weeks. She portrayed her son as a compassionate, child-like man who enjoyed watching ‚ÄúPeppa Pig‚Äù, a British children‚Äôs television program, and who was bewildered and frightened by his incarceration. She said her son had attempted to take his own life when he was 14 years old and was suffering from anorexia. Michael Sandford was arrested after an incident at a Trump rally at the Treasure Island hotel in Las Vegas on June 18, and later told an investigator he wanted to kill the Republican presidential candidate, according to U.S. court papers. He has not been charged with attempted murder. ‚ÄúI accept that Michael has tried to do a bad thing but he is mentally ill and is not a bad or dangerous person,‚Äù said his mother, adding that she had last spoken to him on the phone on Sunday. ‚ÄúHe kept breaking down and sobbing on the phone, saying ‚Äòplease, please, I just want to come home‚Äô. He‚Äôs very remorseful ... He‚Äôs just in a really bad way,‚Äù she said. Sandford has launched a campaign to have her son repatriated to Britain so he could be treated in a secure medical facility. She has raised $25,950 through the crowd-funding website Crowd Justice to pay for legal and other expenses. She said a British consular official who had visited her son in prison had reported that he was shackled and handcuffed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not clear that Michael actually understands what he has done,‚Äù said Saimo Chahal, the family‚Äôs British lawyer, speaking alongside Lynne Sandford. ‚ÄúBecause of his Asperger‚Äôs, OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and other psychological conditions there is a question mark over whether he‚Äôs fit to plead and to undergo the trial process in the States,‚Äù she said. Chahal said she was working to provide the public defenders‚Äô office in Nevada with independent evidence of Michael Sandford‚Äôs mental illness. She expected the trial to be postponed by at least 56 days initially to allow time for that. She hoped a trial would not happen and that Sandford would be repatriated to Britain as part of a plea bargain agreement. ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 "
"Buffett rebukes Trump, questions his business skill","OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday campaigned alongside U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a rowdy rally in his home state of Nebraska, where he challenged Republican Donald Trump to release his tax returns and questioned Trump‚Äôs business acumen. Trump, a New York real estate developer making his first run at public office, has said he cannot release his tax returns, a ritual of U.S. presidential campaigns, until the Internal Revenue Service has completed an audit. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôve got news for him,‚Äù said Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based in Omaha. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions about the items that are on there,‚Äù Buffett added, saying Trump was ‚Äúafraid‚Äù not of the tax-collecting IRS but of voters. In response, Trump‚Äôs spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: ‚ÄúAs you know, Mr. Trump is undergoing a routine audit.‚Äù She had no immediate comment when asked to respond to Buffett saying that he too was under audit but would release his tax returns. Trump has asserted his success as a businessman qualifies him to lead the country, but Buffett, who backs Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, said Trump lost money the only time he went to the American people and asked them to invest.  He said it was in 1995 when Trump listed his Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange. He said the company lost money every year for the next decade. A monkey would have outperformed Trump‚Äôs company, Buffett said. In 1995, ‚Äúif a monkey had thrown a dart at the stock page, the monkey on average would have made 150 percent,‚Äù he said. Buffett spoke for nearly 30 minutes to a raucous capacity crowd of roughly 3,100 people in a suburban Omaha high school with Clinton sitting at his side. He said Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfinal straw‚Äù was an ABC interview broadcast on Sunday in which he criticized the Muslim parents of a decorated U.S. soldier killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago. The father Khizr Khan spoke at last week‚Äôs Democratic National Convention about their son and attacked Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump said he was ‚Äúviciously‚Äù attacked by Khan, a naturalized U.S. citizen, when the father publicly doubted Trump had read the U.S. Constitution. Khan said that Trump had ‚Äúsacrificed nothing,‚Äù prompting Trump in his ABC interview to say, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve made a lot of sacrifices.‚Äù Buffett on Monday bluntly contradicted Trump. ‚ÄúNo member of the Buffett family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan. No member of the Trump family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan,‚Äù Buffett said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve both done extremely well during this period and our families haven‚Äôt sacrificed anything.‚Äù In his remarks Buffett announced the launch of a get-out-the vote effort, pledging to take at least 10 people to the polls who would otherwise have difficulty getting there. Buffett said he was backing a website, Drive2Vote, that would coordinate transportation to cast votes and that he had reserved a trolley that seats 32 people for the same purpose. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be on it all day. I‚Äôm going to do selfies, whatever it takes,‚Äù Buffett said. Buffett said his goal is to generate the highest voter turnout in the congressional district that includes Omaha of any in the country. Nebraska is one of two U.S. states that award electoral votes in presidential elections by congressional district. Clinton responded to Buffett‚Äôs pledge with a promise of her own, if his turnout goal is met. ‚ÄúWarren and I will dance in the streets of Omaha together! Maybe if we‚Äôre really lucky he‚Äôll wear his Elvis costume again!‚Äù she said.  ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2016 "
Colorado Governor says Trump doesn't understand fracking issue: Denver Post,"(Reuters) - Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper on Monday criticized Donald Trump‚Äôs comments about fracking, saying the Republican presidential candidate does not completely understand the issue,  the Denver Post reported. Trump, during a campaign in Colorado, said that while he supports fracking, he also believes state and local governments should be able to ban fracking, the Denver Post reported.

Trump rebuts criticism by Army father at Democratic convention,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump rejected criticism from the father of a soldier killed in Iraq who said the Republican presidential nominee had ‚Äúsacrificed nothing and no one‚Äù and questioned whether the mother was allowed to speak during the couple‚Äôs appearance at the Democratic convention.  ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve made a lot of sacrifices,‚Äù Trump told ABC News in excerpts of an interview posted on Saturday. ‚ÄúI work very, very hard.‚Äù  Khizr Khan, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin and a Muslim, won widespread praise when he spoke Thursday at the Democratic National Convention, telling the story of his son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed by a bomb in Iraq in 2004.  He also attacked Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and asked if the candidate had read the U.S. Constitution. He pulled out a pocket-copy from the inside of his suit coat, in one of the most commented moments on the night that Hillary Clinton accepted her party‚Äôs nomination for president.   ‚ÄúDid Hillary‚Äôs script writers write it?‚Äù Trump asked ABC‚Äôs George Stephanopoulos in the interview, saying he has indeed sacrificed by employing thousands of people, and raising ‚Äúmillions of dollars‚Äù for veterans.  Trump said Khan appeared ‚Äúvery emotional and probably looked like a nice guy to me.‚Äù But the businessman also cast doubt on why Khan‚Äôs wife did not speak. ‚ÄúShe was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably, maybe she wasn‚Äôt allowed to have anything to say, you tell me,‚Äù Trump said. Clinton at a campaign rally Saturday night in Youngstown, Ohio, said the Khans specifically and Muslims generally are the most recent recipients of Trump‚Äôs insults, and referenced his past statements about immigrants and the disabled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long list my friends. I don‚Äôt know, maybe he doesn‚Äôt have anything positive to say,‚Äù Clinton said.  Earlier in the day, Clinton said in a statement that she was ‚Äúvery moved to see Ghazala Khan stand bravely and with dignity in support of her son¬†on Thursday night.

"Trump 'not thrilled' with debate dates, Clinton vows 'to be there'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican candidate Donald Trump said he is unhappy with the dates set for this fall‚Äôs presidential debates, but White House rival Hillary Clinton countered that the schedule was decided long ago and vowed to show up regardless of his objections.      The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has scheduled three televised debates ahead of the Nov. 8 election - Monday, Sept. 26, Sunday, Oct. 9, and Wednesday, Oct. 19. The dates were set almost a year ago. Trump and other Republicans said they should be changed because of conflicts with National Football League games. ‚ÄúI think two of the three are against the NFL, so I‚Äôm not thrilled with that,‚Äù the Republican presidential nominee said in an interview with ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù that aired on Sunday. Speaking to reporters while campaigning at a cheese barn in Ashland, Ohio, Clinton noted that the debate schedule had been established long before the two major political parties chose their nominees. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be there. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say,‚Äù Clinton said just days after the end of the Democratic National Convention, where the former secretary of state accepted her party‚Äôs presidential nomination. In a statement, the commission said the chosen dates ‚Äúwill serve the American public well,‚Äù adding that it was impossible to avoid all sporting events when working out the schedule. It said the debates had never been rescheduled for such conflicts. Trump, who tweeted on Friday that Clinton was ‚Äútrying to rig the debates‚Äù so that fewer people would watch, suggested in the ABC interview that his rival wanted the debates to be held ‚Äúwhen nobody‚Äôs home‚Äù to watch. Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser and former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives,¬†tweeted that the scheduling ‚Äúmakes me think the commission is rigged to help hide Hillary from the voters.‚Äù The commission was established in 1987 by the Republicans and Democrats to ensure the debates became a permanent part of the campaign after a series of ‚Äúhastily arranged‚Äù events in 1976, 1980 and 1984 - and no debates in 1964, 1968 and 1972. Neither party is involved with running the commission, which is governed by an independent board of directors. It is co-chaired by former Republican National Committee chairman Frank Fahrenkopf and Mike McCurry, a former press secretary in Bill Clinton‚Äôs White House. David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, suggested on Twitter that Trump could be ‚Äújust trying to ditch‚Äù the debates. When asked directly whether Trump would participate, his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said the Republican candidate ‚Äúwants to participate‚Äù but also seeks ‚Äúthe maximum audience.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre going to sit down with the commission in the next week or so and we‚Äôre going to start talking to them and we want to make sure we have a broad audience, understanding, watching the debates,‚Äù Manafort told CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù RNC Chairman Reince Preibus said the debates would get more viewers if they were on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday nights. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be working with the commission and what they‚Äôre putting together,‚Äù Preibus said on CBS. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to agree with anything that our nominee doesn‚Äôt agree with.‚Äù Clinton adviser John Podesta called the complaints ‚Äúmore Trump debate malarkey.

Clinton, along with her running-mate Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, is on a three-day tour of Pennsylvania and Ohio after becoming the first woman to accept a major U.S. party‚Äôs presidential nomination at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Thursday. Pennsylvania and Ohio are two states in the U.S. Rust Belt that are dealing with job losses caused by the decline in U.S. manufacturing. Neither leans heavily in favor of either political party but both voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012.  Trump has zeroed in on white, working-class voters in the region as critical to his campaign and plans to visit both states early next week.  In a visit earlier on Saturday to Johnstown Wire Technologies in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Clinton told the largely union crowd there that she would create good-paying jobs by investing in infrastructure and reject a pending Asia trade deal that has become a flashpoint in the U.S. presidential campaign. ‚ÄúWe are going to say ‚Äòno‚Äô to unfair trade deals, we‚Äôre going to stand up to China,‚Äù Clinton said.  ‚ÄúI feel strongly about this and I need your help,‚Äù she added. The pending Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiated by President Barack Obama has drawn criticism from both Clinton and Trump. Clinton says it does not do enough to protect U.S. workers. Trump has said he would rip it up and questioned whether Clinton would keep her stance if she wins the Nov. 8 presidential election. Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers, which represents roughly 200 of the 260 workers employed by Johnstown Wire Technologies, assured the crowd in his introduction of Clinton that Republicans have been ‚Äútelling lies‚Äù about Clinton‚Äôs stance on the deal.  Cambria County, where Johnstown Wire Technologies is based, is 94-percent white and has a median household income of $42,000. Clinton and Kaine will continue their jobs-focused tour that began in Philadelphia, continuing on to Youngstown and Columbus. They are trying to contrast their plan to use infrastructure investments to create jobs with that of Trump, whom Clinton said Friday has a ‚Äúdownbeat vision of America.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are visiting places that prove what Americans can do,‚Äù Clinton said in Johnstown. ‚ÄúThis country and our people have what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead if they have the leadership that gives us that chance.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 30, 2016 "
Exclusive: Clinton campaign also hacked in attacks on Democrats,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A computer network used by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign was hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The latest attack, which was disclosed to Reuters on Friday, follows two other hacks on the Democratic National Committee, or DNC, and the party‚Äôs fundraising committee for candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives. A Clinton campaign spokesman said in a statement late on Friday that an analytics data program maintained by the DNC and used by the campaign and a number of other entities ‚Äúwas accessed as part of the DNC hack.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised,‚Äù said Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill. Later, a campaign official said hackers had access to the analytics program‚Äôs server for approximately five days. The analytics data program is one of many systems the campaign accesses to conduct voter analysis, and does not include social security numbers or credit card numbers, the official said. The U.S. Department of Justice national security division is investigating whether cyber attacks on Democratic political organizations threatened U.S. security, sources familiar with the matter said on¬†Friday. The involvement of the Justice Department‚Äôs national security division is a sign that the Obama administration has concluded that the¬†hacking was sponsored by a state, people with knowledge of the investigation said. While it is unclear exactly what material the hackers may have gained access to, the third such attack on sensitive Democratic targets disclosed in the last six weeks has caused alarm in the party and beyond, just over three months before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Hackers, whom U.S. intelligence officials have concluded were Russian, gained access to the entire network of the fundraising Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, said people familiar with the matter, detailing the extent of the breach to Reuters for the first time. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said earlier this week they had concluded, based on analysis of malware and other aspects of the DNC hack, that Russia engineered the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to influence the U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it was ‚Äúaware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe FBI takes seriously any allegations of intrusions, and we will continue to hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,‚Äù the agency said in an emailed statement. The hack did not involve the private email system Clinton used while she was secretary of state. Yahoo News reported on Thursday night that the FBI had warned the Clinton campaign last March that it was a target of a cyber attack involving spearphishing and had asked the campaign to turn over sensitive data to help in its investigation, but that campaign lawyers rejected this request as too intrusive. A source familiar with the matter confirmed this account to Reuters.  The new disclosure to Reuters that hackers gained access to the full DCCC network means they would have had access to everything on the network from emails to strategy memos and opposition research prepared to support Democratic candidates in campaigns for the House. The hack of the DCCC, which is based in Washington, was reported first by Reuters on¬†Thursday, ahead of Clinton‚Äôs speech in Philadelphia accepting the Democratic party‚Äôs nomination. Russian officials could not be¬†immediately reached for comment. Several U.S. officials said the Obama administration has avoided publicly attributing the attacks to Russia as that might undermine Secretary of State John Kerry‚Äôs effort to win Russian cooperation in the war on Islamic State in Syria. The officials said the administration fears Russian President Vladimir Putin might respond to a public move by escalating cyber attacks on U.S. targets, increasing military harassment of U.S. and allied aircraft and warships in the Baltic and Black Seas, and making more aggressive moves in Eastern Europe. Some officials question the approach, arguing that responding more forcefully to Russia would be more effective than remaining silent. The Obama administration announced in an April 2015 executive order that it could apply economic sanctions in response to cyber attacks.  The hack on the DNC, made public in June, led to WikiLeaks publishing more than 19,000 emails last weekend, some of them showing favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on Sunday as a result, creating a rocky start for the party‚Äôs convention in Philadelphia this week. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up thousands of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù emails from Clinton‚Äôs time at the State Department, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. On Thursday, Trump said his remarks were meant as sarcasm. Earlier in the week, Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan had criticized Trump and called the hacking ‚Äúa national security issue.‚Äù Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said on Friday the reported breach showed cyber security is ‚Äúa problem wherever Hillary Clinton goes. Hopefully this time there wasn‚Äôt classified or top secret information that puts American lives at risk.‚Äù In Washington, the DCCC said early on Friday it had hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to investigate. ‚ÄúWe have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network,‚Äù the DCCC said. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.‚Äù The DCCC had no additional comment late on Friday. Officials at the DNC did not respond to requests for comment.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN on Friday she had not heard about the hack of the Clinton campaign. But she said: ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. I think it should be pretty clear that both campaigns should be aware that there‚Äôs a problem out there. Everybody should be cautious.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 "
Clinton campaign: no evidence computer systems were compromised,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign said on Friday that an analytics data program maintained by the Democratic National Committee and used by the campaign was accessed as part of a hack, but outside experts have found no evidence that its internal systems have been compromised.

Trump to Clinton: 'No more Mr. Nice Guy',"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he was taking the gloves off in his battle against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House after taking a scorching from speakers at the Democratic National Convention. Trump wrapped up a five-day, seven-state campaign swing in Colorado on Friday, where for a fifth straight day his supporters chanted ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù whenever he brought up Clinton‚Äôs name. Trump supporters say Clinton deserves to be prosecuted for her handling of U.S. foreign policy as President Barack Obama‚Äôs first-term secretary of state and for her use of a private email server while in that office. All week Trump has sought to tamp down the chants by stressing that his main goal is to simply beat Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. But as the crowd chanted the slogan in Colorado Springs, Trump finally relented. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to agree with you, frankly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo more Mr. Nice Guy.‚Äù In Denver later, he changed his tune when he heard the chant. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what I‚Äôd rather do, honestly, is just beat her on Nov. 8 at the polls. She would be a disaster,‚Äù he said. Trump was a punching bag at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, which wrapped up Thursday night, as speaker after speaker - including some Republicans - said he lacked the temperament to be president. Clinton herself said in her acceptance speech that the election represented a ‚Äúmoment of reckoning‚Äù for the country. In Colorado Springs, Trump got sidetracked by a couple of disputes from last year as he tried to rebut a Clinton campaign ad. That ad uses video clip from Trump‚Äôs attack on Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly in protest of her questioning of him at a debate of Republican presidential contenders last August when he said afterward that blood was ‚Äúcoming out of her eyes, coming out of her wherever.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was talking about her nose,‚Äù Trump said in Colorado Springs. ‚ÄúI wanted to get back on the issue of taxes‚Äù at the debate. Trump also brought up the case of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, whom Trump seemed to mock publicly in video used by the Clinton ad. Trump said he was depicting the reporter groveling to him. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know he was disabled. I didn‚Äôt know it at all. I had no idea,‚Äù he said. ",politicsNews,"July 30, 2016 "
Clinton gets down to campaign business with Rust Belt trip,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took her newly energized White House bid on the road on Friday for a tour of crucial ‚ÄúRust Belt‚Äù states Pennsylvania and Ohio, but the campaign‚Äôs focus was clouded by a newly disclosed cyber attack. Reuters on Friday reported that the computer network used by Clinton‚Äôs campaign, which is based in Brooklyn, had been hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations, citing people familiar with the matter. The campaign said a data program maintained by the Democratic National Committee and used by the campaign and other entities was accessed as part of a cyber attack on the DNC. The Clinton campaign said outside experts had found no evidence that its internal systems had been compromised.  On Thursday, Reuters reported that the party‚Äôs fundraising committee for candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives had also been breached, the second such incident after last weekend‚Äôs leak of DNC emails. Revelations from the DNC emails gave the Democratic convention a rocky start, threatening a bid to reunify the party after a bitter primary campaign. Even so, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday showed Clinton leading Republican rival Donald Trump by 6 percentage points. Nearly 41 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 25 percent picked ‚Äúother,‚Äù according to the new July 25-29 online poll of 1,043 likely voters, which overlapped with the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. After a speech Thursday night in which she became the first woman to accept a major party‚Äôs presidential nomination, Clinton launched a three-day bus tour of Ohio and Pennsylvania, which like other Rust Belt states have been hit by the decline in U.S. manufacturing.  Clinton and her vice presidential running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, on Friday attended a rally at Philadelphia‚Äôs Temple University, toured a factory in Hatfield and ended the day in Harrisburg. They will continue onto Ohio on Saturday and Sunday.  Clinton is likely to face a tough challenge in such states from Trump, a New York businessman who is trying to win white working-class voters with rhetoric blasting free trade and illegal immigration. Clinton and Kaine are using the Rust Belt tour to highlight manufacturing successes and discuss how they plan to boost wages for the middle class. In the process they aim to contrast their vision for the country with the one offered by Trump. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for a kind of pessimistic, downbeat vision of America, we‚Äôre not your folks,‚Äù Clinton said in Hatfield. ‚ÄúWe do not buy into that dark, divisive, image that was presented at the Republican convention last week.‚Äù Opinion polls show a potentially tight race in Ohio and Pennsylvania, both of which President Barack Obama won in the 2012 election. ‚ÄúThe differences are stark,‚Äù Kaine said in Harrisburg. Clinton and Trump are essentially tied in Ohio, where the Republicans held their convention last week, according to an average of polls by RealClearPolitics. Clinton has a lead of 4.4 percentage points in Pennsylvania, the website‚Äôs average of recent polls showed. Ohio and to a lesser extent Pennsylvania are among a handful of competitive states traditionally viewed as decisive in presidential elections, because they do not lean heavily Democratic or Republican. In her speech on Thursday, Clinton, 68, a former first lady and U.S. senator, promised to make the United States a country that works for everyone if she is elected. ‚ÄúWe are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid,‚Äù she said. Clinton portrayed Trump as a threat to the country, saying, ‚ÄúA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.‚Äù   Trump, 70, sent out a flurry of comments on Twitter on Friday morning lambasting media coverage of the speech as ‚Äúa joke,‚Äù calling the address ‚Äúvery long and very boring‚Äù and accusing Clinton of wanting to shut down ‚Äúcoal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing.‚Äù  He campaigned in another swing state, Colorado, on Friday and was scheduled to visit Ohio next week.  The U.S. television audience for Clinton‚Äôs acceptance speech was smaller than the viewership of Trump‚Äôs address a week earlier, according to ratings data released on Friday. An estimated 29.8 million people watched Clinton across 10 broadcast and cable networks, Nielsen data showed. Trump drew 32.2 million viewers in his July 21 address at the Republican National Convention.     Economic issues will be crucial as the White House campaign enters its final three-month stretch. The U.S. economy grew by only 1.2 percent in the second quarter, far less than expected, the Commerce Department said on Friday.  During the Rust Belt trip, Clinton will detail her pledge to raise wages and create jobs by unveiling a major infrastructure package within the first 100 days of her presidency, and encouraging companies to invest in workers.    The start of the Democratic convention was overshadowed by the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who quit over leaked emails showing party officials favored Clinton over her primary rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator of Vermont. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said on Monday there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the  emails in order to influence the election. The Kremlin has denied the accusations. Yet another hack came to light on Thursday, when four people familiar with the matter told Reuters that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a cyber attack against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises money for Democrats running for the U.S. House of Representatives. The DCCC confirmed on Friday that it had been the target of a cyber security incident.  ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 "
Federal judge strikes down parts of Wisconsin voter laws,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday struck down a string of Wisconsin voting restrictions passed by the Republican-led legislature and ordered the state to revamp its voter identification rules, finding that they disenfranchised minority voters. U.S. District Judge James Peterson, ruling in a legal challenge to the laws by two liberal groups, said he could not overturn the entire voter ID law because a federal appeals court had already found such restrictions to be constitutional. But Peterson, in his 119-page ruling, said the requirements that Wisconsin voters show either a photo identification or go through a special petition process had unfairly burdened minorities and needed to be reformed or replaced before the November presidential election. ‚ÄúTo put it bluntly, Wisconsin‚Äôs strict version of voter ID law is a cure worse than the disease,‚Äù the judge wrote.  Peterson left the voting rules intact for the Aug 9. primary elections for federal, state and local offices, saying to change them less than two weeks in advance would be disruptive.  But his ruling was expected to impact the November presidential election in Wisconsin, which could prove a crucial battleground state for Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Peterson also struck down as unconstitutional limits on in-person absentee voting, residency requirements and a ban on using expired student identification. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said in a tweet that he was ‚Äúdisappointed in the decision by an activist federal judge‚Äù and expected to file an appeal. A spokesman for One Wisconsin Institute, one of the two groups which filed the challenge, hailed Peterson‚Äôs ruling as ‚Äúa huge win not only for the plaintiffs but for democracy itself.‚Äù  Wisconsin is one of several Republican-led states that have passed such voter ID laws in recent years amid fear of fraudulent voting by illegal immigrants and others.  Among the nine states with the strictest laws, insisting on state-issued photo identification for voters, are Georgia, Indiana, Texas and Virginia. A U.S. appeals court judge earlier this month ruled the Texas law discriminatory. The judge sent the case back to the lower court to examine whether the law had a discriminatory purpose and also asked the court for a short-term fix for the November general election. Republicans say voter ID laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. Democrats say the laws are really intended to make it harder for poor African-Americans and Latinos, who tend to vote Democrat, to vote. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 "
U.S. Air Force asks industry for proposals to replace nuclear missiles,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force asked industry on Friday for proposals to replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile and the nuclear cruise missile as the military moves ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. The Air Force said in a statement it expected to award up to two contracts for a new ICBM weapons system, or ground-based strategic deterrent, sometime next summer or fall. It also expected to award up to two contracts in the same time frame for a new nuclear cruise missile, or long-range standoff weapon. Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force is expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade as the United States works to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimate the cost of modernization at $1 trillion over 30 years. The new ICBM system would be a follow-on to the Minuteman missile, whose launch systems and physical infrastructure first became operational in the mid-1960s. The system has been upgraded over the years, but much of the infrastructure is original, the Air Force said. The most recent versions of the Minuteman III date from the late 1990s and early 2000s and had an intended 20-year life span, the Air Force said. The missile will ‚Äúface increased operational and sustainment challenges until it can be replaced,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúThis request for proposals is the next step to ensuring the nation‚Äôs ICBM leg of the nuclear triad remains safe, secure and effective,‚Äù said Major General Scott Jansson, who leads the Air Force program office for strategic systems. Opponents of replacing the nuclear cruise missile have argued that its missions could be handled by other legs of the triad. Others say it is an unnecessary expense at a time of shrinking budgets and smaller deployed nuclear arsenals. The military insists the new cruise missile is needed to enable older bombers to deliver nuclear weapons to targets whose air space is heavily defended and difficult to reach with gravity bombs. The missile is ‚Äúneeded to replace the aging air launched cruise missile, which has far exceeded its originally planned service life ... and is required to support our B-52 bomber fleet,‚Äù Admiral Cecil Haney, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, told lawmakers earlier this year.

U.S. worried about hunger-striking Cuban dissidents: State Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is concerned about the physical well-being of hunger-striking activists in Cuba and is closely watching their situation, the U.S. State Department said on Friday. ‚ÄúWe stand in solidarity with those who advocate for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly,‚Äù State Department spokesman John Kirby told a briefing. ‚ÄúWe have raised our concerns directly with the Cuban government, both in Washington and Havana,‚Äù he added. Kirby said Washington was particularly concerned about the health of dissidents Carlos Amel Oliva, who leads the youth wing of a Cuban dissident group, and Guillermo Farinas.  Farinas began a hunger strike earlier this month calling, for Raul Castro‚Äôs government to end torture and human rights abuses. He was taken to Arnaldo Milian Castro Hospital in the city of Santa Clara on Thursday after becoming extremely weak and fainting eight days into the strike, The Miami Herald reported. Farinas and about 20 other rights activists are on hunger-strike in Cuba. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 "
U.S. court rejects NJ Senator Menendez's bid to end corruption case,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday refused to dismiss a corruption indictment against Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, rejecting the Democrat‚Äôs claim that the U.S. Constitution shielded him from prosecution. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said prosecutors could pursue charges that Menendez accepted campaign donations and gifts, including a stay in a Caribbean villa and private jet flights from a wealthy friend, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for using his office to lobby on his behalf. ‚ÄúMembers of Congress are not to be ‚Äòsuper-citizens‚Äô immune from criminal liability,‚Äù Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro wrote for a three-judge panel of the Philadelphia-based appeals court. Friday‚Äôs decision means the case could eventually be headed for trial, and could complicate Democrats‚Äô efforts to regain control of the U.S. Senate after the Nov. 8 election. If Menendez, 62, were forced to give up the seat he has held since 2006, Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, could under New Jersey law appoint a temporary replacement. The senator has pledged to stay in office while defending himself, but has given up his post as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Abbe Lowell, Menendez‚Äôs lawyer, said the senator intends to ask the entire appeals court to review Friday‚Äôs decision, and, if necessary, appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision is ‚Äúanother step in the legal process that, at the end of the day, will show that Senator Menendez has always acted in accordance with the law,‚Äù Lowell said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Senator remains confident that he will be vindicated.‚Äù Peter Carr, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment. In an indictment unveiled in April 2015, Menendez was accused of accepting bribes from Melgen in exchange for interceding in various matters on his friend‚Äôs behalf. Prosecutors said these included an $8.9 million Medicare billing dispute, and a contract dispute with the Dominican Republic in which Menendez encouraged the State Department to intervene. Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty to the respective charges they faced in the 22-count indictment. Last September, U.S. District Judge William Walls in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed four bribery counts but left most of the government‚Äôs case intact. In his appeal, Menendez argued that his actions were protected by the Constitution‚Äôs ‚Äúspeech or debate‚Äù clause, which offers broad protection to members of Congress against prosecution for actions they undertake as legislators. Ambro, however, said Menendez‚Äôs actions amounted to ‚Äúessentially lobbying on behalf of a particular party,‚Äù and thus outside the ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù provided in the Constitution. There is ‚Äúa sufficient basis for the district court‚Äôs conclusion that the predominant purpose of the challenged acts was to pursue a political resolution to Dr. Melgen‚Äôs disputes,‚Äù Ambro wrote. ‚ÄúIt was not to engage in true legislative oversight or otherwise influence broad matters of policy.‚Äù Lowell had argued that Walls should have focused on what actually went on at the meetings in question, saying the record reflected that ‚Äúhigh-level policy discussions‚Äù had taken place. Ambro said Menendez remains free to argue that his efforts were directed toward influencing policy, and the government still has the burden at trial of proving otherwise. ‚ÄúThe evidence in favor of Senator Menendez will no doubt channel forcefully his position at trial,‚Äù the judge wrote. Friday‚Äôs decision came one month after the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the bribery convictions of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. That court said routine political activities such as arranging meetings or reaching out to public officials generally could not form a basis for criminal prosecutions. The 3rd Circuit focused mainly on the speech or debate clause, and did not mention McDonnell. Lowell said that case raised ‚Äúimportant‚Äù issues that need to be addressed. The case is U.S. v. Menendez, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-3459. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 "
Democratic fund-raising group for Congress candidates confirms hack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A committee that raises money for Democratic candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives confirmed on Friday it had been hacked in an intrusion possibly linked to Russian hackers, similar to an earlier breach targeting another Democratic Party group. In an incident that escalated concerns about the potential for Russian meddling in U.S. politics, Reuters first reported on Thursday that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing the hack at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC. The intrusion took place from at least June 19 to June 27, though it may have been longer, according to analysis conducted by U.S. network security company FireEye.  The committee said in a statement it has hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to investigate. ‚ÄúWe have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network,‚Äù the committee said. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.‚Äù The DCCC hack may be related to an earlier hack against the Democratic National Committee, which raises money and sets strategy for Democratic candidates nationwide. The DNC and DCCC occupy the same office building in Washington. Potential links to Russian hackers in both incidents were likely to heighten accusations, so far unproven, that Moscow is trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election campaign to help Republican nominee Donald Trump. The Kremlin denied involvement in the DNC cyber attack. In June, a bogus website was registered with a name resembling a DCCC donation site. For some time, donation-related internet traffic that was supposed to go to a donation-processing firm instead went to the fake site. The DCCC intrusion may have been used to compromise the computer systems of donors who visited the spoof site, rather than to collect their personal information, said John Hultquist, manager of cyber espionage analysis at FireEye. Several major Democratic donors contacted by Reuters on Friday said they had not been notified of the hack and were not concerned about their information being accessed.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm less concerned about that than I am about my Amex being hacked,‚Äù said John Morgan, 60, a Florida attorney. Cindy Miscikowski, 68, a California donor, said she would be upset if hackers got her bank information, but otherwise she was not worried because donations are disclosed publicly.    The timeframe of the DCCC hack would place it days after the DNC went public with its breach and said the hackers had been kicked out of its systems.  Sources said the numerical Internet address of the spurious DCCC site resembled one used by a Russian government-linked hacking group, one of two suspected in the DNC breach. Rich Barger, co-founder of security intelligence firm ThreatConnect Inc, said his analysis of the fake donation site tied it to the group linked to Russian military intelligence.  He said the web domain name was set up through a service that accepts bitcoin, with a contact email address that had been used to set up websites involved in a major German hack, which also was attributed to the Russian group. Cyber experts and U.S. officials said this week there was evidence that Russia engineered the DNC hack to release sensitive party emails and influence U.S. politics. The DNC hack raised concerns among Democrats at the party‚Äôs convention in Philadelphia, where Hillary Clinton was nominated as the party‚Äôs candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The new hack at the DCCC could add pressure on the Obama administration to make a public accusation or retaliate. The Justice Department and other agencies have said it is important for deterrence to ‚Äúname and shame‚Äù cyber adversaries. ‚ÄúAny efforts on a nation state‚Äôs part to interfere with U.S. politics through cyber attacks would appear to cross a line that would demand a response from the U.S. government,‚Äù said D.J. Rosenthal, a former Justice Department and National Security Council official. A former White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any formal accusation would require overwhelmingly certain evidence. Staffers for the Republican National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said separately that those campaign organizing groups had not been hacked.

Obama to showcase TPP after trade deal demonized in campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - During a visit from Singapore‚Äôs prime minister on Tuesday, President Barack Obama will extol the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and commit to getting the deal done, a top White House official said on Friday, even though Obama‚Äôs fellow Democrats panned it at their convention this week.  Obama wants the U.S. Congress to approve the 12-nation trade deal, which he sees as a central part of his economic and foreign policy legacy, before he leaves the White House on Jan. 20. Free trade deals have been blamed for U.S. manufacturing plant closures, job losses and stagnant wages. Obama has cast the TPP as righting the wrongs of past trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Both countries also are part of the TPP. Both Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump oppose the TPP, and it has become a hot-button issue in the campaign to replace Obama. Congressional leaders have been pessimistic about the odds of ratifying the deal either during the short session in September, or during the brief ‚Äúlame duck‚Äù session after the Nov. 8 election. When Obama rolls out the red carpet for Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday, one of the main goals will be ‚Äúlifting up the benefits‚Äù of the TPP, said Daniel Kritenbrink, top Asia policy adviser at the White House National Security Council. ‚ÄúI predict he will also once again say to the prime minister that he‚Äôs committed to getting TPP done and doing so before the end of his term,‚Äù Kritenbrink told reporters on Friday. ‚ÄúTPP is going to be great for the American economy, for American workers and American companies,‚Äù Kritenbrink said, noting Singapore, a signatory to the deal, strongly supports it. Trump has argued vociferously against multinational trade deals like TPP, saying he would prefer instead to have deals with specific countries one on one. On Thursday night at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Trump said TPP should be rejected. ‚ÄúI like trade where the United States makes a lot of money,‚Äù he said. Trump has been critical of Clinton, Obama‚Äôs former secretary of state, and her vice presidential running mate Tim Kaine, for shifting their positions to oppose the trade deal. Signs protesting the deal were prominent during the Democratic convention, which wrapped up on Thursday. Kaine, a Democratic senator who had praised the TPP deal until he joined Clinton‚Äôs ticket, told CNN on Friday that he was concerned the deal gives corporations the power to challenge trade practices, but not unions or environmental groups. ‚ÄúThe deal is going to come up for a vote and I can‚Äôt vote for it with these secret courts that are open to the companies only,‚Äù Kaine said in the interview. Obama is ‚Äúacutely aware‚Äù of the difficult election year politics for the TPP but that will not stop him from forging ahead, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters on Friday. ‚ÄúThe president absolutely believes this deal should pass this year,‚Äù Schultz said.

"U.S., Cuba hold 'substantive' second round talks on claims","WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The United States and Cuba have concluded a ‚Äúsubstantive‚Äù second round of talks on multibillion-dollar claims against one another in Washington and agreed to hold more regular meetings on the matter, a State Department Official said on Friday. The former Cold War foes had a first meeting outlining their respective claims in December in Havana as part of a deepening detente. The issue is one of the key and complex obstacles to normalization of relations between the two countries. ‚ÄúThe second meeting was more substantive both in exploring more details about claims that need to be resolved but also in reviewing the practices of both countries in solving claims,‚Äù the State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúBoth sides agreed they would have more regular meetings.‚Äù There is no set date yet for the next meeting, which will place in Havana, in accordance with bilateral protocol, the official said. Cuba wants at least $121 billion in reparations for economic damages caused by the U.S. trade embargo and at least $181 billion for ‚Äúhuman damages.‚Äù The United States has awarded its firms and individuals $1.9 billion worth of claims against Cuba for factories, farms, homes and other assets that were nationalized on the island after Fidel Castro‚Äôs rebels came to power in 1959. Those claims are now roughly worth $8 billion when including 6 percent annual interest.  The Cuban government has reached settlements with other countries for expropriated assets but it cut off negotiations with the United States when bilateral relations soured in the 1960s. Many of the nationalized companies no longer exist and individual claims have been passed to heirs. The State Department official said the United States also is claiming $2.2 billion for court judgments outstanding against Cuba and hundreds of millions for former government mining interests on the island. Cuba‚Äôs Foreign Ministry said in a statement the two countries had continued sharing information on their respective claims ‚Äúwith the aim of preparing the process of negotiation.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 "
The year of 'Neither': Why Reuters/Ipsos is tweaking its U.S. presidential poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a presidential campaign notable for its negativity, the option of ‚ÄúNeither‚Äù candidate appears to be an appealing alternative, at least to participants in the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Many voters on both sides have been ambivalent in their support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, complicating the task of the pollsters trying to track the race. That sentiment may help explain an apparent skew that recently emerged in the Reuters/Ipsos poll results. Given the choice, a relatively large group of voters opted for ‚ÄúNeither/Other‚Äù candidate compared with other major polls, leading to an underreporting of several percentage points for one or other of the two major contenders at times in the race. As a result, Reuters/Ipsos is amending the wording of the choice¬†and¬†eliminating the word ‚ÄúNeither,‚Äù bringing the option in line with other polls.      The amended Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll will be published later Friday, available at polling.reuters.com.  From the beginning of June until the middle of July, the Reuters/Ipsos¬†survey¬†showed consistently lower support for Trump than other¬†polls were capturing.¬†At times, the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed¬†Clinton with a lead¬†over Trump as wide as about 12 percentage points among registered voters -¬†five percentage points higher than Clinton‚Äôs lead¬†in some other comparable polls. To determine the cause, the pollsters examined what made the Reuters/Ipsos poll different.¬†Their conclusion: By giving respondents the option of ‚ÄúNeither/Other,‚Äù the survey appears to¬†have captured greater numbers of ambivalent voters unwilling to commit to either candidate than other major polls, which only offer the choice of ‚ÄúOther.‚Äù During the period analyzed, the historically¬†high antipathy for both major candidates,¬†paired with the option of selecting ‚ÄúNeither/Other,‚Äù meant the Reuters/Ipsos poll probably¬†underreported¬†Trump‚Äôs support before the Republican convention, perhaps by 3 to 5 percentage points.  More recently, the ‚ÄúNeither/Other‚Äù option¬†appeared¬†to lead to an underreporting of¬†Clinton‚Äôs support in the run-up to the Democratic convention, said Cliff Young, pollster and president of Ipsos Public Affairs, which partners with Reuters on the poll. The pollsters estimated the Clinton shortfall at 2 to 4 percentage points. Tom W. Smith, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Society at the University of Chicago, said the earlier Trump numbers in the Reuters/Ipsos poll could have indicated a softness of support for Trump among a relatively small group of conservative voters who had yet to come to terms with his candidacy.¬† It is plausible that a similar effect among Democratic voters may be hitting Clinton now when presented with the option of ‚ÄúNeither,‚Äù he said. And the skews displayed by the ‚ÄúNeither‚Äù phenomenon may indicate there is a chance for some gains among alternative party candidates, Smith said. Tim Mclheny, a 47-year-old civil servant from Vermont who describes himself as a moderate Republican, is a case in point.¬†When asked in the Reuters/Ipsos poll who he will vote for in November, he skipped both Trump and Clinton and opted for ‚ÄúNeither/Other.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is the lesser of two evils,‚Äù Mclheny said.¬†He said he will cast his ballot for the candidate he believes will do the best for civil servants.¬†Ultimately, however,¬†he said¬†he may well grudgingly opt for Trump come November. Here‚Äôs how the pollsters reviewed their methodology and decided to drop ‚ÄúNeither.‚Äù Ipsos tested three alternate versions of the presidential preference questions on different groups in a survey and compared those results to the outcome of the established version of the tracking poll.¬† That test found eliminating the word ‚ÄúNeither‚Äù from the ‚ÄúNeither/Other‚Äù response increased Trump support by between 3 to 5 percentage points on any given day leading up to the Republican convention. It also increased Clinton‚Äôs support, but by a smaller margin.¬†spotlight.ipsos-na.com/?p=5574 Since the convention, however, Trump‚Äôs support seems to have solidified among wary supporters. Now,¬†the ‚ÄúNeither‚Äù issue appears to be affecting Clinton in the survey. On Tuesday, for example, the established tracking poll had the candidates tied at 38 percent each. A 13-point lead for Clinton on July 14 had vanished¬†in two weeks. (polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/PD1:1/dates/20160701-20160726/type/smallest) But eliminating ‚ÄúNeither‚Äù from the ‚ÄúNeither/Other‚Äù answer produced a different result. In that case, Clinton was ahead, 40 percent to 36 percent, on Tuesday.  When asked the question in the new way, 11 percent of voters opted for ‚ÄúOther.‚Äù By comparison, 14 percent opted for ‚ÄúNeither/Other‚Äù in the version of the survey that showed the race tied. The three-point gap suggests the ‚ÄúNeither‚Äù phenomenon was now working against Clinton. In the nearly five years Reuters/Ipsos has been offering the ‚ÄúNeither/Other‚Äù option to respondents in presidential polling, it has never yielded such a skew. The results highlight how poll designs and methodologies can yield significantly differing results, and how important differences can emerge from the way a question is framed. The Economist/YouGov poll, like the Reuters/Ipsos survey, is conducted online. It uses a similar battery of questions, but does not offer the ‚ÄúNeither/Other‚Äù option, just ‚ÄúOther.‚Äù In Economist/YouGov‚Äôs July 17 poll, Clinton was ahead by 4 percentage points among registered voters, with Trump at 41 percent. The NBC News/SurveyMonkey online poll gives three options: Clinton, Trump, or ‚ÄúNo Answer,‚Äù which more firmly prods respondents to make a choice. In their July 17 poll, Clinton led Trump by one point, 46 to 45, among registered voters. Telephone polls tend to ask voter preference as an open-ended question, or just offer respondents the choice of the Democratic and Republican candidates. Among phone polls, such as the ABC News/Washington Post and NBC/Wall Street Journal surveys, Clinton recently led by four to five points. The CBS/New York Times telephone poll of registered voters had the race tied at 40 percent each. The Reuters/Ipsos presidential-preference poll result and other results in the survey are updated twice a week. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 "
Exclusive: FBI probes hacking of Democratic congressional group - sources," SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI is investigating a cyber attack against another U.S. Democratic Party group, which may be related to an earlier hack against the Democratic National Committee, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The previously unreported incident at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, and its potential ties to Russian hackers are likely to heighten accusations, so far unproven, that Moscow is trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election campaign to help Republican nominee Donald Trump.  DON‚ÄôT MISS:¬† Alphabet and Amazon wind up 'smokin'' quarter for big tech Why Russian pump prices rise as oil prices fall Democratic campaign group for Congress confirms computer hack The Kremlin denied involvement in the DCCC cyber-attack. Hacking of the party‚Äôs emails caused discord among Democrats at the party‚Äôs convention in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.  The newly disclosed breach at the DCCC may have been intended to gather information about donors, rather than to steal money, the sources said on Thursday.  It was not clear what data was exposed, although donors typically submit a variety of personal information including names, email addresses and credit card details when making a contribution. It was also unclear if stolen information was used to hack into other systems.  The DCCC raises money for Democrats running for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The intrusion at the group could have begun as recently as June, two of the sources told Reuters.  That was when a bogus website was registered with a name closely resembling that of a main donation site connected to the DCCC. For some time, internet traffic associated with donations that was supposed to go to a company that processes campaign donations instead went to the bogus site, two sources said.  The sources said the Internet Protocol address of the spurious site resembled one used by Russian government-linked hackers suspected in the breach of the DNC, the body that sets strategy and raises money for the Democratic Party nationwide.  Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the DNC hack to release sensitive party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election.  ‚ÄúI have concerns that an agency of foreign intelligence is hacking and interfering with a U.S. election,‚Äù said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who added he had not seen news of the DCCC attack.  Asked by Reuters to comment on whether Russia played a role in a cyber-attack on the DCCC, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see the point any more in repeating yet again that this is silliness.‚Äù  The release of the DNC emails by activist group WikiLeaks caused uproar in the party because they appeared to show favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race for the nomination for the Nov. 8 election. The committee is supposed to be neutral.  The DNC and the DCCC share the same office space on South Capitol Street in Washington.  The DCCC and donation processing company ActBlue had no comment on Thursday. CrowdStrike, the California-based cyber security firm that investigated the DNC breach, declined to comment.  Justin Harvey, chief security officer at Fidelis Cybersecurity company, said the suspect website in the hack was affiliated with others that host sophisticated malware undetected by the vast majority of antivirus providers.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really rare malware,‚Äù which would be more likely to be wielded by government hackers than ordinary criminals, he said.  Russian officials have dismissed allegations of Moscow‚Äôs involvement in hacks of U.S. political groups. ‚ÄúIt is so absurd it borders on total stupidity,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Peskov said on Thursday.  Some Democratic officials have accused Russia of hacking the DNC emails in order to help Trump win the race for the White House.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no coincidence someone is hacking into Democratic Party computers. It‚Äôs almost sounding like a repeat of Watergate,‚Äù Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democrats said, after Reuters reported the DCCC hacking.  ‚ÄúThis is just the kind of dirty politics we expect from Donald Trump. I have no doubt Donald Trump is behind it,‚Äù he said, citing the businessman‚Äôs praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and recent remarks about Russia and Clinton‚Äôs deleted emails.  Trump angered Democrats this week by inviting Russia to unearth tens of thousands of emails from rival Clinton‚Äôs tenure as U.S. secretary of state. Trump said on Thursday his comment was meant to be sarcastic.  Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who once worked for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, said the possibility of the DCCC being hacked was cause for great concern.  ‚ÄúUntil proven otherwise, I would suggest that everyone involved with the campaign committee operate under the assumption Russians have access to everything in their computer systems,‚Äù Manley said.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation referred questions about the DCCC attack to a statement it made on Monday about the DNC hack:  ‚ÄúThe FBI is investigating a cyber intrusion involving the DNC and are working to determine the nature and scope of the matter. A compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace.‚Äù  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Thursday the U.S. intelligence community was not ready to ‚Äúmake the call on attribution‚Äù as to who was responsible for the DNC hack.  Clapper, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, acknowledged: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just a few usual suspects out there‚Äù who might be responsible for the cyber intrusion, suggesting it was the work of a state actor rather than an independent hacking group.  Clapper said in May he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the November election neared. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obama‚Äôs campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes, officials have said.

Killing TPP would hand China 'keys to the castle': U.S. trade representative,"LIMA (Reuters) - Failure to ratify the U.S.-led sweeping trade pact TPP would hand China ‚Äúthe keys to the castle‚Äù on globalization and do nothing to solve the real problems underlying American anxiety over jobs, the top U.S. trade official said Thursday. The tariff-slashing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has turned into a hot-button topic in the run-up to the Nov. 8 U.S. election, threatening to dampen support from lawmakers needed to pass a deal critics condemn as a job-killer. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said he was still optimistic Congress would pass the 12-member TPP, in part because China has been moving ahead with a trade deal of its own, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), that would boost its exports and let it set labor and environmental standards in the fast-growing Asia Pacific region. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre one vote away from either cementing our leadership in this region and in the global trading system or ceding it to China,‚Äù Froman told reporters in Lima after attending the inauguration of Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.  ‚ÄúAt the end of the day I don‚Äôt think Congress wants to be responsible for handing the keys to the castle to China.‚Äù Froman‚Äôs defense of the TPP follows weeks of heated attacks on the deal as anti-TPP chants and signs have peppered the Republican and Democratic conventions. Republican nominee Donald Trump has called the TPP a ‚Äúdeath blow‚Äù for manufacturing jobs and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has firmed up her opposition to it in recent days. Froman declined to comment on the candidates but said the TPP had become a ‚Äúscapegoat‚Äù for legitimate concerns over income inequality, stagnant wages and jobs lost to automation. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to vote on the next generation of robots,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou get to vote on trade agreements‚Äù. But the debate over TPP has also helped broaden support for domestic policies, such as infrastructure development and educational programs, to help Americans adapt to rapid economic change, Froman said. U.S. President Barack Obama wants the TPP passed this year. Froman ruled out renegotiating the ‚Äúcarefully balanced‚Äù text, but said issues were being solved by working on country implementation plans. He cited pork producers, dairy farmers and financial services as once-reluctant stakeholders that now back the TPP. ‚ÄúThe last major issue outstanding has to do with biologics and intellectual property rights,‚Äù Froman said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having good constructive conversations‚Äù with members of Congress.

"Daughter Chelsea casts Clinton as great mom, driven public servant","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Chelsea Clinton took the stage of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday to portray her mother Hillary Clinton as a loving, smart and playful woman qualified to be elected president of the United States.   In a 12-minute introduction received warmly in a packed Philadelphia arena, Chelsea Clinton countered criticism that her mother is an untrustworthy politician who struggles to show compassion in front of American voters. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a woman driven by compassion, by faith, by a fierce sense of justice and a heart full of love,‚Äù the only child of presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton and former U.S. President Bill Clinton told the crowd. Hillary Clinton took the stage minutes later to become the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major U.S. party.  Chelsea Clinton, a 36-year-old mother of two, was the last in a series of speakers at the four-day gathering who sought to cast Hillary Clinton in a familial light ahead of the Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump. She called her mother a ‚Äúwonderful, thoughtful, hilarious‚Äù person who made time during her childhood to attend dance and piano recitals, and to gaze at the sky with her to find ‚Äúshapes in the clouds‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat feeling of being valued and loved, that‚Äôs what my mom wants for every child. It is the calling of her life,‚Äù Chelsea Clinton said. President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had also given speeches supporting Clinton, casting her as qualified for the Oval Office because of her experience as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, but also because of her loyalty and passion. Chelsea Clinton, who has been in the public eye since her childhood in the White House, took a low profile after her father left office in 2001. She married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky and served as vice chair of the Clinton Foundation charity. After her mother‚Äôs presidential bid she re-entered public life to hit the campaign trail, endearing herself to supporters with stories of Clinton as a mother and grandmother to her children, Charlotte, aged 2 come September, and Aidan, born in June. Trump has also relied on his children to soften his image. His eldest daughter Ivanka spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week, depicting the New York businessman as ‚Äúcolor-blind and gender-neutral‚Äù to counter critics who have called his comments about immigrants and women bigoted and callous. Both candidates‚Äô children say they are friends, a relationship they struck up before their parents launched campaigns for the White House. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 "
"For inspiration, new Democratic stars look to Elizabeth Warren","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Twelve years ago, Barack Obama‚Äôs electrifying speech at the Democratic National Convention brought tears to Andrew Gillum‚Äôs eyes. Now mayor of Tallahassee, Florida, and viewed as a rising star in that state, Gillum did not hesitate when asked to name his political role model.  ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren,‚Äù he replied, referring to the firebrand U.S. senator from Massachusetts.  That the 37-year-old African-American mayor of a Southern U.S. city identifies Warren as his political lodestar speaks volumes about the Democratic Party‚Äôs progressive shift, even as Hillary Clinton officially became its presidential nominee after a quarter-century in the public eye. With the party in transition, Clinton‚Äôs 1990s-era brand of Democratic centrism is slowly being eclipsed by a wave of progressivism personified by Warren and by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a rival of Clinton‚Äôs until he endorsed her this month. Although Sanders‚Äô insurgent presidential bid fell short, leaving his supporters bitterly disappointed, a new crop of Democratic candidates seems determined to carry on his work, with Warren, 67, as their putative leader.  Like Obama in 2004, Gillum and many others at the Philadelphia convention sought to boost their profiles, raise cash and network with fellow Democrats, buoyed by the adoption of the most progressive platform in party history, with planks for debt-free college, expanded Social Security benefits and a tax on carbon emissions. Clinton, too, has moved to the left, embracing many of these causes, separating herself from a more moderate brand of Democratic politics personified by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who was pro-free trade, friendlier to Wall Street and emphasized budget discipline.  She appealed to Sanders supporters during her speech accepting the party‚Äôs presidential nomination on Thursday, pledging to work with him on progressive issues. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go out there and make it happen together,‚Äù Clinton said.  Sarah Lloyd, 44, a congressional candidate in Wisconsin who supported Sanders, said, ‚ÄúThere is an energy that‚Äôs coming from the folks that were brought to the process by the Sanders campaign.... That can only be a positive thing for the party.‚Äù More than Sanders, Warren has taken the lead in shaping the Democrats‚Äô next generation. Formerly a professor of law, Warren conceived and set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau formed in 2011 under President Obama. She launched a political action committee to back Democratic candidates and inspired other advocacy groups, such as the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, to solicit donations to a bloc it terms the party‚Äôs ‚ÄúWarren wing.‚Äù A speaker at the convention, Florida‚Äôs Gillum was frustrated by Sanders because he seemed disinterested in helping other Democratic candidates, in contrast with Warren.  ‚ÄúSenator Sanders was content to be a movement by himself,‚Äù Gillum said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a revolution when you bring people along with you.‚Äù  Warren‚Äôs committee has donated to the campaigns of U.S. Senate hopefuls such as Kamala Harris, 51, of California, Jason Kander, 35, of Missouri, and Catherine Cortez Masto, 52, of Nevada. They and Wisconsin‚Äôs Lloyd oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the global trade deal that has split the progressive and moderate elements of the party. The PCCC‚Äôs slate of ‚ÄúWarren wing‚Äù candidates supports a $15-an-hour minimum wage, campaign-finance reform and tighter rules for Wall Street.  One of those on the slate is Zephyr Teachout, a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York, who has campaigned in a T-shirt that reads, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from the Elizabeth Warren wing of the party‚Äù and who has been endorsed by Sanders.  ‚ÄúThere is a rising and very important populism, talking about money in politics, talking about trade, talking about economic issues,‚Äù Teachout, 44, told Reuters. ‚ÄúWithin the party, and across the board, there has been a serious rethinking of trade, rethinking of big banks, rethinking of monopolies that have too much power.‚Äù Tulsi Gabbard, a U.S. representative from Hawaii, is often mentioned by Sanders supporters as one who could assume his mantle. A cable-news regular, Gabbard, 35, was one of a few Sanders supporters offered a convention speaking slot. Onstage she formally nominated Sanders for president, saying he had become a ‚Äúvoice for millions, connecting seamlessly with laborers in the Rust Belt and environmentalists in the West.‚Äù Other rising Democratic progressives frequently cited by strategists include Julian Castro, 41, the U.S. housing secretary, and his twin brother, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, former Ohio state senator Nina Turner, 48, U.S. Senate candidate Pramila Jayapal, 50, of Washington, and former South Carolina lawmaker Bakari Sellers, 31. Harris might be the one to shine the brightest. As California‚Äôs attorney general, Harris has been mentioned as a potential U.S. presidential candidate or U.S. Supreme Court justice should she win her Senate race in November. She enjoys the support of Warren, Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent, suggesting she can appeal to both the party‚Äôs liberal and moderate flanks.  She joined forces with Bloomberg in his crusade for tighter gun laws, bonded with Warren over helping homeowners struggling through the foreclosure crisis of the late 2000s and joined Obama‚Äôs efforts to overhaul a criminal justice system that tends to treat black citizens more harshly than white ones. In one campaign ad, Warren is viewed saying, ‚ÄúKamala Harris was fearless.‚Äù Harris, in turn, has backed Clinton. In an interview, she rejected the idea that the party is leaving Clinton behind even as it nominates her for president.  ‚ÄúI strongly believe that these two generations have much more in common than what separates them in terms of fundamental values,‚Äù Harris said.

"Among Democrats, another convention hums in Sanders fans' phones","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - There is the Democratic convention unfolding onstage in Philadelphia this week, broadcast to millions on television. Then there is a second convention that exists largely hidden from public view in the smartphones of Bernie Sanders‚Äô delegates. Using various messaging apps and secret Facebook groups, many of the delegates pledged to the U.S. senator and runner-up in the party‚Äôs presidential nomination contest have been coordinating among themselves in Philadelphia.  This is where they debate how to show their opposition to Hillary Clinton, who will formally accept her nomination on Thursday as the Democratic Party‚Äôs candidate for the Nov. 8 election but who is viewed by many left-leaning Sanders‚Äô supporters as too moderate. There are arguments, flashes of paranoia and conspiracy as well. The messages often fly around too quickly to track. ‚ÄúIt makes your head explode, all these different apps,‚Äù said Jessica Chambers, a Sanders delegate from Wyoming. She added one group using the Slack messaging app had more than 600 delegates. She poked at her iPhone, which had overheated and blacked out. The clearest sign of the networks‚Äô power came on Tuesday evening, when at least 100 Sanders delegates quietly walked out in protest at Clinton becoming the nominee, after word of the plan spread through smartphones about an hour in advance. At the time, Chambers was sitting near her Clinton-supporting friend Shelby Read, who said she is amused by the secrecy of the Sanders crew but supportive of their dissent.  ‚ÄúI never know what they‚Äôre doing,‚Äù Read told her friend later. ‚ÄúI thought people were going out to get food.‚Äù Many of the smartphone debates revolve around the question: What Would Bernie Do? But even when Sanders himself has weighed in, sending a mass text and email to his delegates on Monday evening urging against booing and back-turning, it is not always seen as an authoritative answer.     ‚ÄúIgnore that message,‚Äù one skeptical recipient wrote in a message. ‚ÄúBernie did not write it. Express yourselves freely.‚Äù  The dissent in Philadelphia was fueled by leaked emails last week that showed the Democratic Party leadership tried to undermine Sanders during the primary campaign. In the streets of Philadelphia, thousands of angry left-wing protesters, including Sanders supporters, have marched, with some burning flags. As hails of boos grew from the convention floor on Monday evening, despite Sanders‚Äô call for decorum, one delegate sent a warning around: ‚ÄúStop booing and ‚Äòmisrepresenting‚Äô Bernie and the campaign,‚Äù it read. The replies bristled. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt tell each other what to do,‚Äù ran one.         Secrecy is encouraged among the members of the smartphone chat groups, and so delegates who showed messages to Reuters did so on condition of anonymity. They are wary of the party or security officials thwarting their plans. The closest thing to a leadership structure is Coalition of 57, a small group of delegates that came together in the weeks before the convention. Members say they are in contact with officials in the Sanders campaign, but remain independent. Jeff Weaver, Sanders‚Äô campaign manager, said he was not in contact with Coalition of 57, but otherwise declined to discuss the delegates‚Äô networks.  Coalition of 57 delegates were among those who, with mixed results, sought to tamp down the boos this week, suggesting instead to withhold cheers and applause, or wordlessly hold up protest signs during certain speakers. ‚ÄúLet the silence be deafening,‚Äù Dani Pellett, a coalition member for the Texas delegation, said.

Exclusive: Billionaire Republican donors urge Kochs to back Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of at least six wealthy Republican donors is urging the billionaire Koch brothers to step off the sidelines of the U.S. presidential election to back Donald Trump, arguing they will want influence with the New York businessman they have harshly criticized if he wins the White House in November. The financiers, prominent members of the sprawling 700-member Koch donor network, have been making their case in emails and phone calls to Charles and David Koch ahead of their bi-annual donor seminar, which begins Saturday in Colorado, according to four donors involved in the loosely-coordinated effort and advisers representing two others. An endorsement from the Kochs would be a radical departure: The industrialist brothers have railed against Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúmonstrous‚Äù rhetoric and protectionist policies on immigration and trade. They have said they will not get involved in the presidential election and will instead focus on Senate races.  All the while, Trump has blasted the donor class and vowed not to become a ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù of outside interests as he campaigns to win the Nov. 8 election.  But there is room for a detente.  Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, has long been a darling of the Koch network, and Trump‚Äôs fledgling campaign finance operation could use a cash injection as it faces a $1 billion general election battle against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impossible, or beyond the realm of possibility, that at some point the Kochs are going to get involved,‚Äù said Doug Deason, a member of the Koch network. Deason, who has met with Trump and his confidantes, said he and his father, the billionaire Darwin Deason, had proposed to Charles Koch in an email that he meet the Republican nominee in person. ‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs really important that Donald convince Charles he‚Äôs the right guy, and for Charles to influence Donald‚Äôs policies,‚Äù said Deason. Charles Koch ‚Äúindicates he‚Äôs taking a wait and see approach. He‚Äôs not completely writing if off.‚Äù An adviser to another major Koch network donor added: ‚ÄúSome of the Koch donor class this weekend is surely going to say, ‚ÄòHey, guys, get on board.‚Äô‚Äù A spokesperson for Trump, who is scheduled to hold two campaign events in Colorado on Friday, did not respond to a request for comment. James Davis, a spokesman for the Koch‚Äôs political operation, Freedom Partners Action Fund, declined comment. The billionaire donors eyeing Trump stress they believe it is urgent for the Koch brothers‚Äô conservative thinking to start to influence Trump before the election while he is still fine-tuning policy and considering possible Cabinet picks. The Koch network, made up of the wealthiest conservative families in America, rivals both the Republican and Democratic parties in both its resources and scope. Membership requires a payment of at least $100,000 per year. But it is by no means a monolithic group.  At their donor summit last January in Palm Springs, California, most donors seemed vehemently opposed to Trump among the large field of other Republican options. But now that Trump has won the nomination, vanquishing 16 opponents in the primaries, some see little option but to back him.

(Reuters) - Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, speaking about the hack of Democratic Party emails, said on Thursday the U.S. intelligence community was not ready to ‚Äúmake the call on attribution‚Äù as to who was responsible. The White House said earlier the FBI had not disclosed any information about who was behind the hack. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said on Monday there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election. The emails were released by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, and appeared to show that the Democratic National Committee favored Hillary Clinton over her chief rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.  Clapper, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, acknowledged that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs just a few usual suspects out there‚Äù who might be responsible for the cyber intrusion, suggesting it was the work of a nation-state rather than an independent hacking group.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know enough to ascribe motivation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWas this just to stir up trouble, or was this ultimately to try to influence an election? That‚Äôs a serious proposition.‚Äù Russian officials have dismissed the allegations of Moscow‚Äôs involvement. ‚ÄúIt is so absurd it borders on total stupidity,‚Äù said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ‚ÄúThe Americans need to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what it‚Äôs all about.‚Äù Clapper said comments by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump questioning U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia had rattled foreign intelligence and security officials. While declining direct comment on Trump‚Äôs remarks, he said:        ‚ÄúSuch statements, such rhetoric are very bothersome to our foreign interlocutors, our foreign partners.

"Russia to U.S., Trump: Sort out your own pre-election hacking scandal","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia told the United States on Thursday to get to the bottom of a hacking scandal involving Democratic Party emails itself and rejected what Donald Trump said was a sarcastic suggestion that Moscow should dig up Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúmissing‚Äù emails.   Trump, the Republican Party‚Äôs presidential candidate, angered Democrats on Wednesday by inviting Russia to unearth tens of thousands of emails from rival Clinton‚Äôs tenure as U.S. secretary of state. He spoke out after President Barack Obama said it was possible Russia might try to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election after a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that experts blamed on Russian hackers.  Suggestions of Russian involvement have riled the Kremlin, which has categorically denied this and accused U.S. politicians of seeking to play on Cold War-style American fears of Moscow by fabricating stories for electoral purposes. President Vladimir Putin has tried to avoid giving the impression of favoring any U.S. candidate, while hailing the populist Trump as being ‚Äúvery talented‚Äù. Russian state TV coverage has tended to tilt towards Trump over Clinton.    On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said accusations of a Russian hand in hacking Democratic Party emails bordered on ‚Äútotal stupidity‚Äù and were motivated by anti-Russian sentiment. He rejected Trump‚Äôs apparently sarcastic suggestion for Russia to dig up Clinton‚Äôs emails point-blank. ‚ÄúAs regards these (email) batches, that is not our headache. We never poke our noses into others‚Äô affairs and we really don‚Äôt like it when people try to poke their nose into ours,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThe Americans need to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what it‚Äôs all about.‚Äù Trump, who has repeatedly said he would strive for better U.S. relations with Russia if he won the presidency, also raised eyebrows by saying he would consider recognizing Ukraine‚Äôs Crimea as part of Russia, which annexed the region in 2014. Peskov said the Kremlin was unmoved by that comment, and it would not change what he says has been its neutral stance on U.S. presidential candidates. ‚ÄúWe know perfectly well that candidates in the heat of a pre-election struggle say one thing, but that later, when under the weight of responsibility, their rhetoric becomes more balanced.‚Äù In response to Trump‚Äôs remarks on Crimea, Ukraine‚Äôs U.N. Ambassador Volodymyr Yelchenko said on Thursday: ‚ÄúMr. Trump is not the president of the United States, at least not yet.‚Äù ‚ÄúSecondly, there are the well-known decisions of the United Nations. ... I‚Äôm pretty sure that any U.S. government will pay full respect to those decisions,‚Äù he told reporters.   In March 2014, the 193-member United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring invalid Crimea‚Äôs Moscow-backed referendum seceding from Ukraine.  Analysts say the Kremlin would welcome a Trump victory in November because the wealthy New York businessman has repeatedly praised Putin, spoken of wanting to get along with Russia, and has said he would consider an alliance with Moscow against Islamic State. Trump‚Äôs suggestion that he might abandon NATO‚Äôs pledge to automatically defend all member states is also likely to have gone down well in Moscow, where the Western military alliance is cast as an outdated Cold War relic.

Dispatch from inside the conventions,"(Reuters) - Delegates at both the Republican and the Democratic conventions sported outrageous outfits - but the views from their respective gatherings were a study in contrast. Republican National Convention delegates in Cleveland last week embraced a freewheeling, policy-light lineup, reveling in messages of salvation from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs inner circle, while expressing their fears that America has become less safe.  A man wearing an orange jumpsuit and Hillary Clinton mask told Reuters he had been asked to take pictures standing next to ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of convention-goers, while ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù - a cry to imprison Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton - became the crowd‚Äôs go-to chant.  A woman wearing a red cape with ‚ÄúTRUMP‚Äù spelled out in twinkle lights happily posed for the dozens of passersby requesting photos. The few remaining, weary Ted Cruz supporters found a rallying cry in the former Republican presidential candidate‚Äôs refusal to endorse Trump, a moment of party discord that prompted security to escort Heidi Cruz out of the convention hall and away from irate, yelling Trump supporters.  At this week‚Äôs Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, erstwhile candidate Bernie Sanders worked to build a bridge over troubled waters (yes, Paul Simon performed the song of that name). At the end of a roll call of state delegations, he called for Clinton to be nominated by voice vote - a show of support and a bid for unity after a bitter primary campaign. The move prompted deafening cheers on the convention floor - as well as a boos from Sanders supporters, who, on occasion, could be seen angrily arguing with Clinton backers. And there were celebrities - actresses Eva Longoria, Lena Dunham, America Ferrera, Sigourney Weaver and Elizabeth Banks drew shrieks and cheers from the crowd. But Clinton‚Äôs convention was heavy on policy and calls to public service.  Former President Bill Clinton received a rock star‚Äôs welcome before ticking off a list of his wife‚Äôs civic accomplishments. First lady Michelle Obama drove some members of a rapt audience to tears when she declared, ‚ÄúI wake up in a house built by slaves.‚Äù Reuters photographers caught up with several convention-goers, both Republican and Democrat, and asked ‚ÄúIf you could speak to your nominee, What would you like them to know about your hopes for the future of America?‚Äù Here are some of their responses: ‚ÄúThank you for having my back,‚Äù Sharon Jackson, a delegate from Alaska at the Republican convention, said, referring to Trump. Barbara Finger, a delegate from Wisconsin at the Republican conclave, also expressed gratitude to the New York businessman. ‚ÄúKeep going the way you are,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMake America great again.‚Äù Lavon Bracy, a Democratic delegate from Florida, expressed her support for Clinton at her party‚Äôs convention, emphasizing the importance of unity. She said she hopes, ‚ÄúWe can all live together in harmony and understand that we have differences and appreciate those who are different.‚Äù Democratic delegate Alvin Peters of Panama City, Florida, said he, too, hoped for brighter days. ‚ÄúSpread the joy,‚Äù said Peters. ‚ÄúDispel the doom and gloom.‚Äù¬†  Reuters photo slideshow: reut.rs/2aAmRRd ",politicsNews,"July 28, 2016 "

Trump says was being 'sarcastic' in Russia hack comments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday tried to quell the furor over his call for Russia to find Hillary Clinton‚Äôs deleted emails, saying he was being sarcastic. In Moscow, meanwhile, a Kremlin spokesman pointedly told Washington to solve its own email problems. Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù emails from Clinton‚Äôs time at the U.S. State Department, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. Later, he dismissed concerns raised by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook that his comments raised national security concerns. ‚ÄúYou have to be kidding. His client, his person, deleted 33,000 e-mails illegally. You look at that. And when I‚Äôm being sarcastic with something ...‚Äù Trump said in a Fox News interview broadcast on Thursday. Asked if he was indeed being sarcastic, Trump snapped, ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm being sarcastic. They don‚Äôt even know, frankly, if it‚Äôs Russia. They have no idea if it‚Äôs Russia, if it‚Äôs China, if it‚Äôs somebody else. Who knows who it is? ‚ÄúBut you have 33,000 (Clinton) emails deleted, and the real problem is what was said on those emails from the Democratic National Committee,‚Äù he said, referring to hacked emails released last weekend by WikiLeaks. The DNC emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The committee is supposed to be neutral. Trump‚Äôs explanation echoed those of his campaign advisers and other supporters, who immediately tried to pass his comments off as tongue-in-cheek and not serious. But the exhortation for a U.S. adversary to use cyber intrusions against an American political candidate drew criticism from intelligence experts and other public figures, including some Republicans. Trump made the remark at a news conference in Miami that allowed him to steal some of the limelight from the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where Clinton on Thursday will accept her party‚Äôs presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúRussia, if you‚Äôre listening, I hope you‚Äôre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,‚Äù Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, told reporters. He later said on Twitter that if anyone had Clinton‚Äôs emails, ‚Äúperhaps they should share them with the FBI!‚Äù The Republican presidential nominee was referring to a private email system Clinton kept in her home in Chappaqua, New York, while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She handed over thousands of emails in 2015 to U.S. officials probing that system, but did not release about 30,000 deleted emails she said were personal and not work-related. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the sensitive Democratic Party emails to influence the election. But the Kremlin beat back those insinuations again on Thursday, saying they were driven by anti-Russian sentiment. ‚ÄúIt is so absurd it borders on total stupidity,‚Äù said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ‚ÄúThe Americans needs to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what it‚Äôs all about.‚Äù Although some Democrats have wondered aloud whether Trump committed a crime in his remarks directed at Russia, the prospect of any prosecution is considered nil because of the strong guarantee of speech rights in the United States.

France is reeling from two strikes in under two weeks by attackers who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, the first when a Tunisian plowed his truck through a crowd in Nice, the second when two men slit the throat of a priest. ‚ÄúFrance is no longer France.

Mistrust of Clinton on trade shadows her at Democratic convention,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When it comes to trade policy, Hillary Clinton is taking heat from all sides. At the Democratic National Convention this week, where Clinton will formally accept her party‚Äôs presidential nomination, opposition to trade deals was plastered on buttons, scrawled on signs and chanted by delegates. Many are worried by her past support of 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is still awaiting congressional approval. Things are unlikely to get any easier for her. Clinton has said her stance on trade has evolved, that she now opposes TPP because it does not do enough to protect jobs and that she wants changes in NAFTA, the trade deal her husband, Bill Clinton, signed during his presidency. But that allows her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to question her credibility, painting Clinton‚Äôs evolving position as a desperate attempt to catch up with his tough stance. Trump has vowed to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA, labeling it a job killer. The real estate developer has also said he would pull the United States out of the 12-nation TPP. Even among the Democrats there are doubts about Clinton‚Äôs resolve, particularly among supporters of her former Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, the U.S. Senator from Vermont whose opposition to trade deals featured prominently in his speeches during the Democratic primary season. The concern about trade was on display at the convention during a speech delivered on Wednesday night by Clinton‚Äôs running mate, Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia who once supported TPP. Delegates waved anti-TPP placards as Kaine spoke, even though he changed his position after joining Clinton‚Äôs ticket. Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, said trade was ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù a danger for Clinton in the race against Trump, saying she had to show her commitment to opposing it and not just ‚Äúmake pronouncements.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Trump campaign is smart enough that they will exploit this issue,‚Äù Cohen said. Sanders supporters have said they intend to keep fighting TPP through the November election via a new group called ‚ÄúOur Revolution‚Äù that is dedicated to championing issues that Sanders pushed on the campaign trail. The frustration that a post-recession recovery has failed to translate into better wages and opportunities for million of working Americans has become one of the leading themes of the 2016 presidential campaign. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken in March showed that 65 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans believed that trade cost some U.S. jobs even though many also agreed that trade helps to keep the costs of goods low. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, told Reuters that Clinton has told all of the major unions that endorsed her that she wanted to re-work NAFTA, echoing similar comments by Dennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers union. Trumka said Clinton‚Äôs campaign has told him that she would take ‚Äúa whole new approach‚Äù on trade and he said he was convinced that he could trust her on the issue. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not giving lip service to it. She‚Äôs committed to it,‚Äù he said. Consulted about Clinton‚Äôs talks with unions regard NAFTA, a senior Mexican government official said the TPP already provided the United States with a platform to strengthen the rights of workers compared to NAFTA, although U.S. union activists say the new pact weakens rather than strengthens workers‚Äô protection. ‚ÄúThey have the solution in their hands, if they back it,‚Äù the official said, noting Congress had yet to ratify the TPP. The official added that it would be in Mexico‚Äôs interests to strengthen the rules of origin in TPP that determine which country a product comes from, but sometimes allow foreign components in it. He cautioned, however, that re-opening trade deals was a highly complex undertaking. Morris Fiorina, a political science professor at Stanford University, said Clinton should try to address workers‚Äô concerns but avoid a wholesale dismissal of free trade. ‚ÄúWere I advising her I‚Äôd suggest she try to thread the needle - explain that free trade has great benefits for the country as a whole, but past and pending agreements do not adequately recognize and compensate the losers.¬†She will remedy that failure,‚Äù Fiorina said. However, such nuanced approach may prove self-defeating in the light of Trump‚Äôs challenge and internal dissent. Robin Biro, a field director for the Democratic Party in Atlanta and a Clinton supporter, said TPP was a make or break issue for Clinton to attract Democrats who voted for Sanders in the primary. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only going to get the support of the Bernie people if she comes out strongly on that issue,‚Äù Biro said.

U.S. theory on Democratic Party breach: Hackers meant to leave Russia's mark,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some U.S. intelligence officials suspect that Russian hackers who broke into Democratic Party computers may have deliberately left digital fingerprints to show Moscow is a ‚Äúcyberpower‚Äù that Washington should respect.  Three officials, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said the breaches of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were less sophisticated than other cyber intrusions that have been traced to Russian intelligence agencies or criminals. For example, said one official, the hackers used some Cyrillic characters, worked during Russian government business hours but not on Russian religious or political holidays.‚ÄùEither these guys were incredibly sloppy, in which case it‚Äôs not clear that they could have gotten as far as they did without being detected, or they wanted us to know they were Russian,‚Äù said the official. Private sector cyber security experts agreed that the evidence clearly points to Russian hackers but dismissed the idea that they intentionally left evidence of their identities. These experts - who said they have examined the breach in detail - said the Cyrillic characters were buried in metadata and in an error message. Other giveaways, such as a tainted Internet protocol address, also were difficult to find. Russian hacking campaigns have traditionally been harder to track than China‚Äôs but not impossible to decipher, private sector experts said. But the Russians have become more aggressive and easier to detect in the past two years, security experts said, especially when they are trying to move quickly. False flags have grown more common, but the government and private experts do not believe that is involved in the DNC case. The two groups of hackers involved are adept at concealing their intrusions, said Laura Galante, head of global threat intelligence at FireEye, whose Mandiant subsidiary conducted forensic analysis of the attack and corroborated the findings of another cyber company, CrowdStrike. Russian officials have dismissed the allegations of Moscow‚Äôs involvement as absurd. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in his only response to reporters, said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to use four-letter words.‚Äù  While private cyber experts and the government were aware of the political party‚Äôs hacking months ago, embarrassing emails were leaked last weekend by the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group just as the Democratic Party prepared to anoint Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election. DNC chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The committee is supposed to be neutral. The U.S. intelligence officials conceded that they had  based their views on deductive reasoning and not conclusive evidence, but suggested Russia‚Äôs aim probably was much broader than simply undermining Clinton‚Äôs campaign. They said the hack fit a pattern of Russian President Vladimir Putin pushing back on what he sees as the United States and its European allies trying to weaken Russia. ‚ÄúCall it the cyber equivalent of buzzing NATO ships and planes using fighters with Russian flags on their tails,‚Äù said one official. Two sources familiar with Democratic Party investigations into the hacking said the private email accounts of Democratic Party officials were targeted as well as servers.  They said that the FBI had advised the DNC that it was looking into the hacking of the individual officials‚Äô private accounts. They also said the FBI also requested additional information identifying the personal email accounts of certain party officials. The DNC hired CrowdStrike to investigate the hack. It spent  about six weeks, from late April to about June 11 or 12,  monitoring the systems and watching while the hackers - who they believed were Russian - operated inside the systems, one of the sources said. What actions, if any, the Obama administration will take are unclear and could depend on what diplomatic considerations may ultimately be involved, a former White House cyber security official said. In past cases, administration officials have decided to publicly blame North Korea and indict members of China‚Äôs military for hacking because the administration decided that the net benefit of public shaming ‚Äì and increased awareness brought to cyber security ‚Äì outweighed potential risks, the former official said. But ‚Äúthe Russia calculation is far more difficult and precarious,‚Äù the former official said. ‚ÄúRussia is a much more aggressive, capable foreign actor both in the traditional military sense and in the cyber realm‚Äù and that made public attribution or covert retaliation much less likely. The former official, and a source familiar with the Democratic Party investigations, said that they also were unaware of any U.S. intelligence clearly demonstrating that WikiLeaks had received the hacked materials directly from Russians or that WikiLeaks‚Äô release of the materials was in any way directed by Russians.

"In clash of billionaires, Bloomberg calls Trump White House race 'a con'","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - New York media mogul Michael Bloomberg assailed fellow billionaire Donald Trump on Wednesday, calling his U.S. presidential race a ‚Äúcon‚Äù and ripping into his history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. ‚ÄúTrump says he wants to run the nation like he‚Äôs running his business? God help us,‚Äù Bloomberg told the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to roaring applause. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one.‚Äù Formerly a Republican and now an independent, Bloomberg was for the most part greeted warmly by the audience in the Wells Fargo Center arena where he threw his support behind the Democrats‚Äô presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. The owner of the Bloomberg media empire and a former New York City mayor, Bloomberg was an odd choice for a speaker at the Democratic conclave, where many party progressives have railed against the influence of billionaires in politics. ‚ÄúLet me thank all of you for welcoming an outsider here, to deliver what will be an unconventional convention speech,‚Äù he said when he took the stage, eliciting cheers. ‚ÄúI am not here as a member of any party. I am here for one reason: to explain why I believe it is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States.‚Äù Bloomberg had considered running for the White House as an independent this year but dropped the idea in March, saying it could increase the chances Trump would win. Bloomberg has known Trump casually for years and twice appeared on Trump‚Äôs reality TV show ‚ÄúThe Apprentice.‚Äù  But since Trump entered the race for president in June 2015, Bloomberg has taken issue with him, lashing out at his policies and fiery rhetoric, especially his call to ban Muslims from entering the country and his promise to wall off the Mexican border and deport millions of undocumented foreigners. On Wednesday, he went a step further and favorably compared his own business record to Trump‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve built a business, and I didn‚Äôt start it with a million-dollar check from my father,‚Äù Bloomberg said. Forbes lists Bloomberg, 74, as America‚Äôs sixth wealthiest American, with a fortune amounting to $47.7 billion.  Trump, 70, who often boasts about his extravagant wealth and success in the real estate business, is listed 113th with $4.5 billion, though that figure has been widely challenged. A Reuters review of Trump‚Äôs federal filings showed he had cash and other liquid investments worth between $60 million and $180 million in May, far short of the amount he would need to self-fund his campaign.

Trump draws ire after urging Russia to find 'missing' Clinton emails,"MIAMI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù emails from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time at the U.S. State Department, vexing intelligence experts and prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. ‚ÄúRussia, if you‚Äôre listening, I hope you‚Äôre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,‚Äù Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, told reporters. Trump made the remark at a testy news conference at his Doral golf resort in Florida that allowed him to steal some of the limelight from the Philadelphia convention where Clinton on Thursday will accept the Democratic presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. The Clinton campaign shot back that Trump was posing a possible national security threat by encouraging a foreign power to conduct espionage in the United States. Some intelligence experts said the comments raised questions about Trump‚Äôs judgment. A spokesman for Trump, Jason Miller, tried to tamp down the storm of protest, saying Trump did not urge Russia to hack Clinton‚Äôs emails. Trump said on Twitter that if anyone had Clinton‚Äôs emails, ‚Äúperhaps they should share them with the FBI!‚Äù The criticism of Trump‚Äôs comments reverberated at the Democratic National Convention where speakers brought up the episode to try to intensify Democratic support for Clinton, who is running neck and neck with Trump in the polls. ‚ÄúDonald Trump today once again took Russia‚Äôs side. He asked the Russians to interfere in American politics,‚Äù longtime Clinton supporter and former CIA Director Leon Panetta said. ‚ÄúDonald Trump ... is asking one of our adversaries to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts against the United States of America to affect the election.‚Äù Another speaker, retired U.S. Rear Admiral John Hutson, said of Trump: ‚ÄúThis morning, he personally invited Russia to hack us. That‚Äôs not law and order, that‚Äôs criminal intent.‚Äù Trump was referring in his remarks to a private email system Clinton kept while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She handed over thousands of emails in 2015 to U.S. officials probing that system, but did not release about 30,000 emails she said were personal and not work-related. A Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of the issue found no basis for criminal charges, but FBI Director James Comey said this month there was evidence Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in her handling of classified information. Trump dismissed suggestions that WikiLeaks‚Äô release of embarrassing Democratic Party emails last week was engineered by Russia to help nudge the U.S. election toward Trump, who has been called ‚Äúvery talented‚Äù by Russian President Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia,‚Äù said Trump. ‚ÄúI never met Putin. I don‚Äôt know who Putin is.‚Äù  The Democratic Party chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned on Sunday after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, for the presidential nomination. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the sensitive party emails in order to influence the presidential election. Throughout a day of campaigning, Trump suggested the culprit could be China or even, as he said in Scranton, Pennsylvania, ‚Äúa 400-pound person lying in bed.‚Äù ‚ÄòFOUR-LETTER WORDS‚Äô Russia has brushed aside suggestions it was involved. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to use four-letter words,‚Äù Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday. Trump has alarmed European allies and many U.S. national security experts with talk of forcing NATO nations to pay more for the U.S. security umbrella. ‚ÄúBy the way, if they don‚Äôt pay, bye bye,‚Äù he said in Toledo, Ohio, on Wednesday night. He has praised Putin in the past and said this week that if elected, he would seek an alliance with Moscow to take on Islamic State militants. But he sought to distance himself from Putin at his news conference, saying his closest interaction with Russia was selling a Florida home to a Russian for more than he paid for it. A U.S. State Department spokesman declined to comment on Trump‚Äôs remarks on Wednesday. Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, took a different approach from the Republican nominee, saying he expected the FBI to get to the bottom of the matter. ‚ÄúIf it is Russia, and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences,‚Äù Pence said in a statement. During the news conference, which lasted more than an hour, Trump also called Barack Obama, a Democrat, the most ‚Äúignorant‚Äù president ever and said Vice President Joe Biden was not bright. Asked if he would recognize Crimea as Russian territory, Trump said he would be ‚Äúlooking into that.‚Äù Crimea has long been part of Ukraine, but Russia annexed it in 2014 after pro-Russian separatists and special forces took over the region. The U.S. government considers it still part of Ukraine. ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2016 "
Activist Steyer expands agenda in bid to defeat 'dangerous' Trump,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer is expanding his political agenda beyond climate change to embrace issues ranging from immigration to income inequality, which he expects will be critical to mustering votes for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November presidential election. Steyer, who four years ago left the hedge fund firm he co-founded in order to devote himself full-time to environmental activism, said he hoped the broader agenda for his NextGen Climate organization would help undermine Republican nominee Donald Trump. He derided the New York real estate magnate‚Äôs policies as ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and ‚Äúdelusional.‚Äù  Steyer has directed NextGen, his main advocacy arm, to delve into immigration, racial justice, wealth inequality and education instead of just environmentalism to better drive youth and minority voter turnout for the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about a broader group of connected issues,  and we don‚Äôt think any of them stand without the others,‚Äù Steyer told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, explaining the shift. NextGen has already produced ads in California attacking Trump on immigration and his temperament. In one, a group of young people are filmed listening to Trump describe Mexicans as rapists and drug dealers and promising to wall off the border. In another, women look into the camera as Trump‚Äôs voice is heard calling women fat, disgusting, and ugly. Steyer said he hoped the broader agenda for NextGen would help undermine Trump. ‚ÄúI show him no respect,‚Äù Steyer said. A Trump spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. NextGen‚Äôs shift into new issues began a few months ago, Steyer said, and was inspired by his work on California‚Äôs progressive Fair Shake commission, launched last year by a group of high-profile activists, academics and former politicians focused on wealth inequality in the state.  ‚ÄúThat was the genesis to some extent. It allowed us to look deeply at all the related issues,‚Äù he said.  NextGen has spent about $20 million so far on the U.S. election, and is likely to spend at least another $55 million by election day.  Steyer, who has earned a reputation as America‚Äôs most influential environmental advocate, has had mixed results in his crusade on climate change, despite the money he has poured into mobilizing voters around the issue. Steyer has battled large-scale oil industry infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by the administration of President Barack Obama last year, and has sought to bolster climate-friendly politicians. In 2014, NextGen pumped around $75 million into efforts to support six climate-friendly Democratic candidates in mid-term elections, but only two of whom won their contests. In the current presidential contest, NextGen has fallen short of its aim make climate change a critical issue, eclipsed by voter rage over issues including immigration, the economy and national security.  Reuters/Ipsos polling shows only about 25 percent of likely American voters will make a choice on the basis of a candidate‚Äôs views on climate change, although most agree that the United States should act to combat it. Steyer endorsed Clinton last month after she clinched the Democratic nomination following a heated battle against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Clinton has said she would seek to advance renewable energy use, boost regulation and reduce U.S. consumption of oil and coal if elected.  ‚ÄúI can take them at their word that they are going to prioritize this,‚Äù Steyer said. Trump has called climate change a hoax and has vowed to cut U.S. environmental regulation to expand U.S. drilling and coal mining, part of his bid to win over blue collar voters. Steyer called that position dangerous.  ‚ÄúIt would be funny if it weren‚Äôt so serious,‚Äù he said. ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2016 "
Senior U.S. lawmakers want information on DNC hack declassified,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrats on the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees called on Wednesday for the White House to consider declassifying and releasing any intelligence community assessments of the hack into the Democratic National Committee email system. Experts have attributed the breach to Russian hackers. ‚ÄúGiven the grave nature of this breach and the fact that it may ultimately be found to be a state-sponsored attempt to manipulate our presidential election, we believe a heightened measure of transparency is warranted,‚Äù Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff wrote in a letter to President Barack Obama. Obama said in an interview broadcast by NBC News on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the leak of more than 19,000 DNC emails, which showed the committee had favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders for the party‚Äôs presidential nomination.

"WTO chief won't debate Trump, but rallies support for trade","GENEVA (Reuters) - The head of the World Trade Organization said on Wednesday he would not get into an argument with U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has described the global trade body as a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù and threatened to quit it. But WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told a news conference he thought the arguments in favor of global trade needed to be put more forcefully. He said he had warned before Britain‚Äôs referendum last month of the risks of leaving the European Union, saying it would require years of complex trade talks to complete, but ‚Äúsometimes people don‚Äôt want to hear the arguments‚Äù.  Appearing on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù on July 24, Trump said U.S. companies that move production to Mexico should be taxed and shrugged off suggestions this would break WTO rules. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to renegotiate or we‚Äôre going to pull out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe think trade is so obviously positive for every economy that it‚Äôs like trying to argue with a friend that he needs to breathe,‚Äù Azevedo said, adding: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we do enough in making the case for trade.‚Äù Azevedo, who said earlier on Wednesday that he would seek a second four-year term as the head of the WTO, said he was impressed by the number of people who had responded to Trump by speaking up for trade, ‚Äúsometimes from unexpected quarters‚Äù. He declined to comment on what would happen if the United States did withdraw from the 21-year-old trading club, which now boasts 163 members and governs the vast majority of global commerce through a system of mutually agreed rules. Under President Barack Obama, the WTO has been an important arena for the United States to defend its commercial interests against China, India and other major trading powers.  A debate over trade also raged before Britain‚Äôs June 23 referendum on leaving the European Union. Britain voted in favor of Brexit despite warnings from Azevedo and others about the risks, and the country now faces years of protracted and complex trade talks to try to extricate itself from the EU. Asked how to improve the quality of debate and help voters understand the issues, Azevedo said people sometimes make decisions ‚Äúon a basis of things that is completely foreign to the rationale of the issue that you are discussing. It has nothing to do with how trade helps or does not help‚Äù. ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2016 "

"No plans to release tax returns as pressure mounts, Trump aide says","(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ‚Äúwill not be releasing‚Äù his tax returns due to a federal audit, his campaign manager said on Wednesday, despite pressure to release them and provide a window into his finances before the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has said that his taxes are under audit, and he will not be releasing them,‚Äù campaign manager Paul Manafort said in an interview with CBS on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThat issue will be dealt with when the audits are done.‚Äù His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has released tax returns and called on Trump to put out his. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has called it ‚Äúdisqualifying‚Äù for a party‚Äôs White House nominee not to make tax returns public.  Trump has come under new pressure to release financial information and show whether he has any ties to Russia. That came after U.S. officials this week said there was evidence that Russia was involved in the recent release of sensitive Democratic Party emails, potentially to influence the U.S. election. Trump has often praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ‚Äústrong leader,‚Äù but on Tuesday he said it was ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for Democrats to suggest Russia would try to help his election bid. ‚ÄúFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia,‚Äù Trump wrote on Twitter. Manafort said on CBS on Wednesday that Trump‚Äôs hesitance to release his tax returns has nothing to do with Russia. Asked to clarify that Trump has no financial relationships with any Russian oligarchs, Manafort responded, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what he said. ...

Make Hillary Likable Again: Democrats seek to recast Clinton,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - When Hillary Clinton first ran for president in 2008 she was badly stung by a backhanded compliment from rival Barack Obama, who called her ‚Äúlikable enough‚Äù before going on to win the Democratic nomination and the White House. Eight years later, with her party‚Äôs nomination to succeed Obama firmly in hand, the question of her likability, trustworthiness and honesty still hangs over her bid to become America‚Äôs first woman president, this time in a Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump. The Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this week is, in part, an effort to reintroduce her to American voters, more than half of whom view her unfavorably, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. The criticisms have dogged her for years: She can appear stiff in front of crowds, struggling to show off the compassion her supporters say she shares in private and leaving some voters with the impression she is not giving straight answers to tough questions. Clinton recognizes the problem, aides say. ‚ÄúShe knows that she has work to do to earn people‚Äôs trust,‚Äù said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton‚Äôs communications director. ‚ÄúShe also realizes there aren‚Äôt some magic words you can say to earn that trust overnight.‚Äù Speaker after speaker at the convention took the stage on Monday and Tuesday to offer testimonials on her behalf, including her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who filled his prime-time speech on Tuesday with anecdotes and private moments shared by America‚Äôs best-known political couple. Gay basketball player Jason Collins told of the support she offered when he went public with his homosexuality; a grandmother described how her daughter‚Äôs battle with drug addiction inspired Clinton to address the drug crisis. A parade of others offered behind-the-scenes glimpses of the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, describing how she drove through a blizzard to attend a funeral, planned birthday parties and visited survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  Clinton‚Äôs personal image, which has fluctuated during her 25 years in the public eye, slumped after a divisive Democratic primary, a lingering controversy over her use of a private email system while serving as the top U.S. diplomat, and repeated Republican attacks on ‚Äúcrooked Hillary.‚Äù Reuters/Ipsos polling showed 55 percent of Americans had an unfavorable view of Clinton. Trump is even less popular, with 61 percent holding an unfavorable view. Many Americans think both candidates struggle with the truth. Some 59 percent of Americans believe she is not ‚Äúhonest and truthful,‚Äù while 53 percent think the same of Trump, according to the poll. Republican strategist John Feehery said it was too late to rehabilitate Clinton‚Äôs image. ‚ÄúYou only get one decade to make a first impression,‚Äù he said.  Instead, a  better strategy would be to focus on tearing down Trump, given that his negatives surpass her own, Feehery added. Clinton‚Äôs campaign appears to be trying just that, running an ad in which Trump can be seen in newsclips, as children watch, swearing, condemning Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers, and mocking a disabled journalist. Clinton, 68, has been a lightning rod for conservative attacks for more than two decades and Republicans serenaded speakers at their convention in Cleveland last week with chants of ‚ÄúLock Her Up‚Äù and signs touting ‚ÄúHillary for Prison.‚Äù  For many Democrats who back Clinton, the poor polling numbers are the result of those relentless attacks - along with a strong dose of sexism toward a woman seeking power. ‚ÄúIf you have somebody who is out there pounding you and pounding you and pounding you, eventually it‚Äôs going to take a toll,‚Äù Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve said this and I‚Äôve said it publicly: Hillary Clinton has to do A+ work to get a C-.‚Äù For Democrats, this week affords perhaps their best chance before the election to fortify her against inevitable attacks by Trump that could further dent her image. Praise came from invitees ranging from party superstars (First Lady Michelle Obama) to unknowns (former White House interns).    In one video broadcast to delegates, Clinton embraces and comforts an 11-year-old girl who fears her parents will be deported. In another, shown before the appearance of the Mothers of the Movement - mothers who lost children to gun violence or in police-involved incidents - she encourages them in a private meeting to band together and speak out. ‚ÄúA 30-minute meeting turned into two hours because she listened to us. Nobody else listened to us,‚Äù said Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old whose fatal shooting death by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012 launched a series of protests around the country. Actress Eva Longoria said it was time for Democrats to rally to Clinton‚Äôs defense. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs had a 25-year smear campaign run against her. It‚Äôs understandable Americans are confused about what is true and what is not,‚Äù she told a women‚Äôs delegate caucus on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2016 "
Kremlin says allegations it hacked U.S. Democratic Party 'made-up horror stories',"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed allegations Russia had hacked Democratic Party emails as ‚Äúhorror stories‚Äù dreamt up by U.S. politicians, saying it never interfered in other countries‚Äô election campaigns. ‚ÄúMoscow is at pains to avoid any words that could be interpreted as direct or indirect interference in the election process,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters. ‚Äú...

Bill Clinton portrays Hillary as 'change-maker' in speech to Democrats,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Former President Bill Clinton portrayed his wife Hillary on Tuesday as a dynamic force for change and a longtime fighter for social justice as he made a case for her historic 2016 bid for the White House.      The ex-president told the Democratic Party convention in Philadelphia that Hillary Clinton was ‚Äúa natural leader‚Äù with an in-built sense of responsibility. ‚ÄúHillary is uniquely qualified to seize the opportunities and reduce the risks we face, and she is still the best darn change-maker I have ever known,‚Äù he said. Earlier in the day, Hillary Clinton secured the Democratic Party‚Äôs nomination for the Nov. 8 election, coming back from a stinging 2008 defeat in her first White House run and surviving a bitter primary fight to become the first woman to head the ticket of a major party in U.S. history. Bill Clinton told the convention in a keynote speech that Hillary had been an activist for social justice since the couple‚Äôs early days as law students together. He told how she gave legal aid services to poor people and went undercover to expose a segregationist school in Alabama in the 1970s.   After a tough battle with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the state-by-state nominating contests, Clinton is now the party‚Äôs standard-bearer against Republican nominee Donald Trump.  Bill Clinton said Republicans led by Trump had made Hillary out to be ‚Äúa cartoon‚Äù but the real thing was nothing like the their portrayal of her.      ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre running against a cartoon. Cartoons are two-dimensional, they‚Äôre easy to absorb. Life in the real world is complicated and real change is hard, and a lot of people even think it‚Äôs boring,‚Äù he said. Then speaking directly to the crowd, he said to cheers and applause: ‚ÄúGood for you because earlier today you nominated the real one.‚Äù     President from 1993 to 2001, Bill Clinton, 69, left office with high approval ratings and is known as one of the most powerful political orators in the country. His speech offered an unusual twist to the warm spousal endorsement of a presidential candidate traditionally given in party conventions by a wife, not a man - let alone a former president of the United States. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs nomination was a milestone in America‚Äôs 240-year-old history. U.S. women got the right to vote in 1920 after ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.  Supporters of Hillary Clinton say her Washington credentials show she has the experience needed for the White House during troubled times as the United States tries to speed up its economic recovery and faces security challenges abroad. Detractors view her as too cozy with the establishment and say she carries political baggage dating back to the start of Bill Clinton‚Äôs first White House term in the 1990s.

"Trump, Pence master delicate art of dancing together on campaign trail","MIAMI (Reuters) - Donald Trump was in the middle of creating another nickname for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton - ‚ÄúHillary Rotten Clinton!‚Äù - when he suddenly thought of his mild-mannered vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence. ‚ÄúYou think Mike Pence would say this?‚Äù he smiled to the audience in Roanoke, Virginia. ‚ÄúWhat a high-quality person.‚Äù On their first campaign swing together this week, Trump and Pence are giving voters an initial look at their odd-couple pairing as they prepare to battle against Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, the Virginia governor, in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Their public routine is a work in progress, but it‚Äôs clear that they‚Äôve learned from their first joint appearance, a sometimes awkward interview on CBS‚Äôs ‚Äú60 Minutes.‚Äù In that session, Trump frequently talked over Pence and Pence went out of his way to wave off his differences with Trump on policies like his past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump wants to renegotiate. They now have a system: When they campaign together, Pence introduces Trump enthusiastically as the modern-day equivalent of 1980s Republican President Ronald Reagan and speaks of himself as the son of a combat veteran and the father of a U.S. Marine. Then he steps aside. The Trump-Pence union was a political marriage of necessity. The combustible, free-wheeling Trump needed the staid, staunchly conservative Pence, the governor of Indiana, to give him some credibility with establishment Republicans and a boost in the Midwest. The risks for Pence seem minimal and the upsides are huge. He opted out of the 2016 Republican presidential sweepstakes in the fallout over his fight over a religious freedom law in Indiana that critics said was anti-gay, and he faced a potentially difficult re-election race for governor. With his experience as a former member of Congress, he could serve as a conduit to lawmakers in a Trump administration, something that could be important for a presidential candidate who has never held elective office. In the two weeks since he was named Trump‚Äôs running mate, Pence has become a lightning rod for criticism from Democrats who portray him as holding extreme right-wing views. Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, John Podesta, described Pence as ‚Äúan incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families.‚Äù Pence seems to be still getting accustomed to Trump‚Äôs worldview. While introducing Trump in Roanoke on Monday, he hewed closely to the establishment Republican position in criticizing Clinton for not doing more to ensure that a contingent of U.S. troops was left in Iraq after a U.S.-Iraqi agreement expired. ‚ÄúRemember, it was Hillary Clinton who squandered the gains that were made at the close of our presence in Iraq, the failure in judgment that sent ISIS on the loose,‚Äù Pence said in Roanoke, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group. That was at odds with Trump‚Äôs view that the American invasion of Iraq was wrong. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to go to Iraq,‚Äù Trump said moments after Pence spoke. Still, Pence‚Äôs loyalty to Trump seems absolute.  In his speech introducing Trump at their appearance before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday, Pence tried to show what Trump is like behind all the bluster. ‚ÄúI know this man‚Äôs heart,‚Äù Pence said. ‚ÄúI know the way he speaks, when the cameras are off.‚Äù Trump chose Pence over former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the two other finalists. Although Republican elites have been divided over Trump‚Äôs presidential bid, many approve his choice in a No. 2. ‚ÄúMike Pence is a good man. He will add value to the ticket,‚Äù tweeted Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and one of Trump‚Äôs former rivals for the nomination. Gingrich said via email that Pence is proving to be ‚Äúa good balance for Trump‚Äôs powerful personality.‚Äù  Trump himself jokingly brought up the vetting process that led him to Pence, describing a candidate who was squeaky clean compared to others whose background checks turned up ‚Äúmany pages‚Äù of materials. ‚ÄúWith Mike, they came back with like nothing. He‚Äôs the most perfect human being, this guy. I love him. Where is he? I love him,‚Äù Trump said. ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 "
Obama says it is possible Russia would try to sway U.S. election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said it was possible that Russia  would try to influence the U.S. presidential election, after a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that experts have attributed to Russian hackers. ‚ÄúAnything is possible,‚Äù Obama told NBC News in an interview broadcast on Tuesday when asked if the Russians would try to influence the Nov. 8 election. Obama said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the leak on Friday of more than 19,000 DNC emails, which showed the committee had favored Hillary Clinton over  Senator Bernie Sanders for the party‚Äôs presidential nomination. ‚ÄúI know that experts have attributed this to the Russians,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWhat we do know is that the Russians hack our systems, not just government systems but private systems,‚Äù he said. The email leak forced Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida to resign as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.

What I do know is that Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin,‚Äù Obama  said. Trump has often praised Putin, calling him a ‚Äústrong leader.‚Äù The New York businessman also told the New York Times last week that with him in the White House, NATO might not automatically defend the Baltic states that were once part of the Russian-led Soviet Union. ‚ÄúI think that Trump has gotten pretty favorable coverage back in Russia,‚Äù Obama said.

UAW chief says Clinton told him she would renegotiate NAFTA,"(Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams said on Tuesday that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has assured him she would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement if she is elected president. Williams‚Äô comments come as Clinton is under pressure on international trade deals from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and supporters of her former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton has previously said she wanted to rework NAFTA. Her campaign on Tuesday declined to comment on the meeting with Williams. Williams said he met with Clinton one-on-one prior to the union‚Äôs endorsement of her in May, when Sanders was still in the race to be the Democratic party‚Äôs nominee. The UAW has more than 400,000 members.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs committed to me that not only would (she) dig into NAFTA but she made every indication that she would sit down and try to redo NAFTA,‚Äù Williams told reporters during a telephone press conference from Philadelphia, where he is attending the Democratic National Convention. Williams said Clinton ‚Äúrecognizes that NAFTA was not the success that it was supposed to be,‚Äù when her husband, Bill Clinton, pushed for it as president two decades ago. Stephen Miller, senior policy adviser to the Trump campaign, said Hillary Clinton ‚Äúwill never renegotiate Bill Clinton‚Äôs NAFTA.‚Äù The Trump campaign adviser said, ‚ÄúYou can be certain when she was personally getting paid millions and millions by Wall Street and big banks to deliver secret speeches she wasn‚Äôt breathing a word against globalist trade pacts.‚Äù  NAFTA, which eliminated most tariffs on trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada, was promoted as a way to support economic growth by eliminating barriers to trade. Opponents say it has robbed Americans of jobs because it makes it easy for U.S. companies to move operations to Mexico where wages are much lower.   Williams said he hopes that an updated treaty would help foster stronger worker unions in Mexico, where many auto manufacturers have factories. ‚ÄúShe told us all that,‚Äù AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in an interview, referring to Clinton‚Äôs assurances to labor unions that she would rework NAFTA. The AFL-CIO, a federation of unions which includes the UAW,  stayed neutral during the Democratic primary but endorsed Clinton in June once it was clear she would become the party‚Äôs nominee. The UAW endorsed Clinton in May. Williams said that support among UAW members for a Trump presidency has fallen to about 19 percent from 28 percent last year, before Trump said that new automotive industry jobs could be placed in states without strong union support at lower wages than those earned by UAW members.

Democrats beat Republicans in first night TV convention audience,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrats beat Republicans in U.S. television ratings, according to Nielsen data released on Tuesday for the first night of the Democratic National Convention. An estimated 26 million people watched Monday evening  between 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. Eastern time, when first lady Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders were among the key speakers, Nielsen said.

The total is about three million more TV eyes than for the first night of the Republican convention last week when White House contender Donald Trump‚Äôs wife Melania was the keynote speaker. All in all, some 23 million Americans watched the first night of the Republican convention last week - in line with the audience for the 2012 gathering. Trump‚Äôs big acceptance speech on Thursday night last week, however, failed to deliver the record audiences many TV executives had been expecting.

U.S. expands Central American refugee screening program,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration announced a broad expansion on Tuesday of a program to let people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras enter the United States as refugees, and said Costa Rica agreed to temporarily shelter some of those with no other recourse. Under the plan, Costa Rica will host up to 200 applicants at a time deemed too vulnerable to remain in their homelands while the U.S. Department of Homeland Security evaluates them for possible resettlement, which could take up to six months. The United States will also expand a program for child refugees and allow some people to apply for refugee status in their home countries. The steps, after months of criticism of President Barack Obama‚Äôs handling of the crisis, are modest in comparison to plans announced by Secretary of State John Kerry in January to open several refugee processing centers in the region. ‚ÄúOur current efforts to date have been insufficient to address the number of people who may have legitimate refugee claims,‚Äù Amy Pope, deputy homeland security adviser at Obama‚Äôs National Security Council, told a telephone briefing for reporters. Many details, including how the program would be financed or how many people might be eligible, were unavailable. Advocates said they were pleased the administration was  moving to provide the migrants, especially children, with an alternative to staying home with their lives at risk or relying on smugglers for the dangerous journey through Mexico. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really the way the program should have been established from the start, but even belatedly we‚Äôre happy to see that this is the direction that they‚Äôre taking it,‚Äù said Bill Frelick, director of the refugee rights program at Human Rights Watch. Since October, nearly 80,000 children and families from the three countries have been apprehended at the U.S. border with Mexico. The crisis has fueled heated debate on the campaign trail over whether to welcome migrants fleeing violence or build a wall to keep them out, a centerpiece of Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs run for president. Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, called the plan an abuse of the law. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs expansion of the Obama Administration‚Äôs policy is simply a continuation of the government-sanctioned border surge,‚Äù he said in a statement. The program also met resistance in the region. Guatemalan government officials rejected the description of those seeking to leave the country as refugees. The administration also will expand its Central American Minors program, which allows those under 21 with a parent in the United States legally to seek refugee status. The program will now allow siblings, care givers or another parent to do so. Only 267 minors have entered the United States since the program began in December 2014. Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said 2,880 applicants have been approved and are awaiting resettlement. The New York Times reported in January that the United States planned to admit up to 9,000 Central American refugees. Costa Rican Minister of the Presidency Sergio Alfaro told a news conference in San Jose the government reserved the ‚Äúexplicit right‚Äù to ask for more information if there were doubts about those granted the six-month humanitarian visas. Carlos Maldonado of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said the UNHCR and International Organization for Migration would handle costs incurred as applicants were processed in Costa Rica. If approved, they would most likely head to the United States, but could go to Canada, Sweden, Argentina, Brazil, Chile or Uruguay. Convincing countries to host a center has been difficult amid concern slow processing would lead to a backlog of people with nowhere to go, U.S. sources said. Nearly 8,000 Cubans migrating to the United States were stuck in Costa Rica recently when neighboring Nicaragua closed its border. Costa Rica‚Äôs location is also a challenge. Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans seeking to move to the United States must travel south, across Nicaragua, to get there. ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 "
Kremlin says idea it hacked U.S. Democratic Party emails absurd,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin dismissed as absurd on Tuesday allegations it was behind the hacking of U.S. Democratic Party emails, saying unidentified individuals were trying to cynically exploit fear of Russia for electoral purposes. It responded after cyber security experts and U.S. officials said there was evidence Russia had engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails in order to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The emails, released by activist group WikiLeaks at the weekend, appeared to show favouritism within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for Hillary Clinton and prompted the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. President Vladimir Putin has tried to avoid giving the impression he favours any U.S. candidate, but has hailed Republican Party nominee Donald Trump as being ‚Äúvery talented‚Äù. Russian state TV, which hews closely to the Kremlin‚Äôs world view, has left little doubt however that Moscow would prefer Trump. It casts Clinton, whom Putin accused of stirring up protests against him in her role as U.S. Secretary of State in 2011, as a warmonger. ‚ÄúWe are again seeing these maniacal attempts to exploit the Russian theme in the U.S. election campaign,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the leaked emails.  ‚ÄúThis is not breaking new ground, this is an old trick which is being played again. This is not good for our bilateral relations, but we understand that we simply have to get through this unpleasant period.‚Äù U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier on Tuesday he had raised the hacking issue at a meeting in Laos with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to use four-letter words,‚Äù was Lavrov‚Äôs only  response to reporters when asked whether Russia was responsible for the email hack. Earlier this month, Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Trump, visited Moscow, where he gave a lecture complaining that Western governments had often had a hypocritical focus on democratisation in the post-Soviet world. Analysts say the Kremlin would welcome a Trump win because the billionaire U.S. businessman has repeatedly praised Putin, spoken of wanting to get along with Russia, and has said he would consider an alliance with Moscow against Islamic State.  Trump‚Äôs suggestion he might abandon NATO‚Äôs pledge to automatically defend all alliance members is also likely to have gone down well in Moscow, where the military alliance is cast as an outdated Cold War relic.

Clinton held a three-point lead on Friday, which was also within the credibility interval.  Clinton has solidly led Trump in the poll throughout most of the 2016 presidential race. The only times that Trump has matched her level of support were when the Republican Party appeared to be roughly aligned with his campaign.  In early May, Trump briefly pulled even with Clinton after his remaining rivals for the party nomination dropped out of the running. He held a 0.3 percentage point lead over Clinton on May 9, the last time he was nominally ahead.  Trump fell back in the poll as he feuded with party bosses over comments he made about Hispanics, Muslims and immigrants, but he rebounded this month as his candidacy took the national spotlight at the Cleveland convention.  The Democratic party is hoping for a similar boost during its convention this week in Philadelphia, but the confab had a rough start: the Wikileaks website released emails on Friday that enraged many voters who had supported Clinton‚Äôs rival for the nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, showing that party officials had looked for ways to undermine his candidacy.  The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, announced her resignation afterward.  On Monday, some speakers at the Democratic convention were booed by Sanders supporters, and hundreds of protesters took to the streets to protest Clinton‚Äôs candidacy.  Presidential candidates usually get a boost in popularity following their party conventions.  In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney jumped by 5 percentage points to pull about even with President Barack Obama after the Republican convention. After the Democrats held their convention, Obama then rose by a few percentage points and again pulled ahead.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with about 962 likely voters.

U.S. opens door to a change in blood donation policy for gay men,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration opened the door on Tuesday to a change in its blood donor deferral recommendations, which currently prohibit donations from gay men for a year following their last sexual encounter in order to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In December the FDA overturned a 30-year ban on all blood donations from men who have sex with men, saying the change was based on science showing an indefinite ban was not necessary to prevent transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. The FDA is now signaling it may go further. Gay rights advocates say the latest update did not go far enough and that the agency‚Äôs recommendations should move closer to individual risk assessments, which could, for example, look at whether an individual has been in a monogamous relationship. Their criticism intensified in the wake of a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June, which saw many gay men unable to donate blood even as blood banks put out calls for donors. In a notice posted to the Federal Register, the FDA said it was establishing a public docket for comment about its current recommendations and that interested people should submit comments, backed by scientific evidence, supporting alternative potential policies to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.  Such suggestions ‚Äúcould include the feasibility of moving from the existing time-based deferrals related to risk behaviors to alternate deferral options, such as the use of individual risk assessments.‚Äù The agency said it would take the comments into account ‚Äúas it continues to reevaluate and update blood donor deferral policies as new scientific information becomes available.‚Äù The FDA‚Äôs action comes after 115 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, led by Democrat Mike Quigley, vice chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, wrote to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf calling on him to end the current policy, saying it discriminated against men who have sex with men. A similar letter was signed by 22 senators. In a statement on Tuesday, Quigley said he was ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù by the FDA‚Äôs announcement. ‚ÄúThe tragedy at Pulse nightclub in Orlando highlighted the discrimination gay and bisexual men face when attempting to donate blood to those in need,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMoving towards an individual risk assessment would provide for a fair, equitable, nondiscriminatory blood donation policy, one based in science that allows all healthy Americans to safely donate blood.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 "
Trump pledges reforms at Veterans Administration if elected,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sought to turn a scandal involving the Veterans Administration to his political advantage on Tuesday, pledging to war veterans that he would clean up a mess he blamed on Washington politicians. ‚ÄúOur debt to you is eternal,‚Äù Trump told a gathering of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Charlotte, North Carolina. ‚ÄúYet our politicians have totally failed you.‚Äù The 2014 VA scandal revolved around long wait times for patients and other negligent activities. Trump spoke shortly after the crowd heard from Bob McDonald, President Barack Obama‚Äôs secretary of Veterans Affairs. The scandal fits in with Trump‚Äôs effort to portray himself as a political outsider dedicated to fixing the problems left by Washington special interests. ‚ÄúThe VA scandals that have occurred are widespread and totally inexcusable,‚Äù he said. Trump is on his first campaign swing with his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, after they were nominated last week at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. They made two stops in North Carolina, a state that could be crucial to their chances in the Nov. 8 election. The New York real estate developer pledged to set up a White House hot line for a ranking official to keep track of reform efforts in the VA to ensure they are carried out. If a problem cannot get solved, he said, ‚ÄúI will pick up the phone personally and get it completed and get it taken care of.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 "
"Orban says Trump's migration, foreign policy plans 'vital' for Hungary","BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Tuesday said the migration and foreign policy plans of U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump were ‚Äúvital‚Äù for Hungary, whereas those of rival Democrat Hillary Clinton were ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù.  The outspoken conservative leader Orban is the first European head of state to express a clear preference for either of the two candidates, who will face each other in elections in November 2016. Orban has in the past upset fellow members of the European Union over policy, most recently with his tough stance on Europe‚Äôs migrant crisis, objecting to EU resettlement plans and having a fence built along Hungary‚Äôs southern border.  Orban said the U.S. Democrats supported migration as well as what he described as ‚Äúdemocracy export‚Äù, while Hungary - like Trump - opposed both, ‚Äúmaking it clear where Hungary‚Äôs interests lie.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Democrats‚Äô foreign policy is bad for Europe, and deadly for Hungary,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe migration and foreign policy advocated by the Republican candidate, Mr Trump, is good for Europe and vital for Hungary.‚Äù Orban had on Saturday called Trump‚Äôs security policies ‚Äúvaliant.‚Äù His remarks came after Trump raised ire for telling the New York Times last week that he would tie any U.S. military help to NATO allies to conditions in the event of a Russian attack. Clinton‚Äôs campaign struggles to contain the political fallout from a leak of thousands of emails in a hacker attack that they said were designed to help Trump. Experts and U.S. officials say the attack came from Russia. Both Moscow and the Trump campaign have said those claims were ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù. Orban‚Äôs government has unnerved some partners with its close ties to Russia. It secured large business deals with Moscow, such as the construction of a big new nuclear power plant, and criticized the European Union‚Äôs embargo on Russia. ‚ÄúHungary‚Äôs foreign policy has borne an eerie resemblance to Russian diplomatic interests in recent years, and indeed has been little short of an extended arm of the Russian government in foreign policy matters,‚Äù Political Capital analyst Peter Kreko said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Putin is behind the budding relationship between Trump and Orban but both are interested in improving Russian ties so theirs is an alliance of interests.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 "
"Behind Democrats' email leak, U.S. experts see a Russian subplot","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If the Russian government is behind the theft and release of embarrassing emails from the Democratic Party, as U.S. officials have suggested, it may reflect less a love of Donald Trump or enmity for Hillary Clinton than a desire to discredit the U.S. political system. A U.S. official who is taking part in the investigation said that intelligence collected on the hacking of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails released by Wikileaks on Friday ‚Äúindicates beyond a reasonable doubt that it originated in Russia.‚Äù The timing on the eve of Clinton‚Äôs formal nomination this week for the Nov. 8 presidential election has raised questions about whether Russia may have been trying to hurt her, to help Trump, her Republican rival, or to fan populist sentiment against establishment politicians as it has sought to do across Europe in recent years. ‚ÄúCertainly Russia has become a master at manipulating information¬†for their strategic goals: Witness the information bubble they have created for their threatening behavior in the Crimea, the Ukraine and elsewhere,‚Äù said former CIA and National Security Agency director Michael Hayden. ‚ÄúA step like this, however, would be really upping their game.‚Äù The emails showed that DNC officials explored ways to undermine U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders‚Äô presidential campaign against Clinton and raised questions about whether Sanders, who is Jewish, was really an atheist. The disclosures confirmed Sanders‚Äô frequent charge that the party played favorites against him and clouded a party convention Clinton hoped would signal unity, not division. Two U.S. intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the hack could be part of a broader campaign by Russian President Vladimir Putin to push back against what he thinks is an effort by the European Union and NATO, a military alliance of European and North American democracies, to encircle and weaken Russia. One of the officials called the fear ‚Äúa hangover‚Äù from Putin‚Äôs service in the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency. ‚ÄúTime and again, we‚Äôre seeing Russia push back at what Putin considers Russia‚Äôs mortal enemies,‚Äù said the other official. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been actively attacking the U.S.-backed rebels in Syria, buzzing ships and planes in the Black Sea and the Baltic, not to mention invading Ukraine and seizing Crimea. This fits the pattern.‚Äù Despite Clinton‚Äôs short-lived attempt as secretary of state to ‚Äúreset‚Äù U.S.-Russian relations after U.S. President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the leaked emails could damage a candidate the Kremlin may consider hostile and benefit her opponent, who has been friendlier. Putin accused Clinton of stirring up protests against his rule after a December 2011 Russian parliamentary election that was marred by allegations of fraud, saying she had encouraged ‚Äúmercenary‚Äù Kremlin foes by criticizing the vote. ‚ÄúShe set the tone for some opposition activists, gave them a signal, they heard this signal and started active work,‚Äù Putin told supporters. Asked about claims that Russian intelligence had hacked the DNC to obtain the emails, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange told NBC News‚Äô Richard Engel ‚Äúthere is no proof of that whatsoever‚Äù and said ‚Äúthis is a diversion‚Äù pushed by the Clinton campaign. TRUMP‚ÄôS WARMER TONEAnalysts said Russia‚Äôs goal may be much broader than simply meddling in the U.S. presidential election. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a gross oversimplification to suggest that the Russian government is all-in for Donald Trump,‚Äù said Andrew Weiss, a Russia analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in Russia‚Äôs interest ... to portray the United States as riven with popular discontent, xenophobia and high-level political corruption,‚Äù Weiss said. ‚ÄúIt fits nicely with the Kremlin‚Äôs standard narrative ... that the White House rushes to criticize others without getting its own house in order.‚Äù The Russian leader may well have been encouraged by Trump‚Äôs comments to The New York Times last week that with him in the White House, NATO might not automatically defend the Baltic states that were once a part of the Russian-led Soviet Union. ¬†¬†¬†¬†Despite public Trump-Putin exchanges of praise, Eugene Rumer, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia, warned against reaching any quick conclusions about Putin‚Äôs view of Trump. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúWe can say with some degree of confidence that they don‚Äôt like Hillary,‚Äù Rumer said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs less clear that they like Trump, although over the years the Russians have said they prefer to deal with the Republicans ‚Äì (that) they are kind of hard-line but they can do deals.‚Äù A diplomat with experience working on Russia said the Kremlin also might be betting that Clinton will win and is sending a shot across her bow. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúMessing with her like this now puts her on notice that these are tough guys that she‚Äôs got to be really careful with,‚Äù said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A U.S. intelligence official who is reviewing the emails as part of the investigation into their origin said that those emails describing the privileges the Democratic National Committee showers on its wealthiest donors bolster the Russian narrative of an American political system rigged by the wealthy and riddled with corruption. ‚ÄúIn addition to countering the U.S. narrative that the Russian government is a corrupt oligarchy, leaking these emails fits rather conveniently with Trump‚Äôs charges about a rigged system and ‚Äòcrooked Hillary‚Äô,‚Äù said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss domestic politics.

Some in Sanders' army seem determined to march on without him,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - It should have been a triumphant night for Hillary Clinton when her rival Bernie Sanders gave a rousing speech urging his supporters to vote for her in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Instead it turned into a sign of potential trouble for her White House bid. His speech on Monday to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia urging the party to unite against Republican Donald Trump was met with some jeers when he endorsed Clinton ‚Äì a sign he had lost control of his own movement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm beyond disappointed,‚Äù California delegate Aleece Depuey, 49, said after Sanders sought to rally support for his one-time rival.   Hundreds of Sanders supporters marched through the streets on Day One of the four-day convention, chanting: ‚ÄúWe want Bernie!‚Äù Delegates wore ‚ÄúBernie or Bust‚Äù buttons. Others donned Robin Hood-style hats, a call to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor.  When he spoke, a scuffle broke out between a Sanders supporter and a Clinton supporter in the hall.  The backlash raised questions over whether - and how - Clinton could ever win over Sanders supporters.  With opinion polls showing the Clinton-Trump race tightening, Clinton needs Sanders‚Äô voters more than ever. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, arrived in Philadelphia with 1,894 of 4,763 delegates after winning 13 million votes in the Democratic nominating contest. To many of Sanders‚Äô backers, Clinton is a bridge too far. They see her as the kind of political insider, backed by reams of corporate money, that drove them to Sanders and his fight to rein in Wall Street and remove income inequality. Others simply do not trust her, opinion polls show.  In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released at the end of June, some 15 percent of Sanders‚Äô backers said they would vote for Trump, and 19 percent would support neither Clinton nor Trump. Sanders won the states of Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, and New Hampshire in the run-up to the convention, and nearly won Iowa - all states that could be closely contested by Trump in the general election. Clinton likely will need some portion of Sanders‚Äô support to stay competitive in those states.  Clinton‚Äôs campaign had hoped in Philadelphia to put the bare-knuckle primary fight behind it, but Sanders‚Äô voters were enraged by Friday‚Äôs embarrassing release of internal party emails by the activist group WikiLeaks showing party officials clearly favored Clinton over their candidate.  Sanders supporters seemed to be everywhere, often with a bigger presence than Clinton supporters, a jarring sight at an event where she is due to be formally nominated as the party‚Äôs presidential candidate.   At a delegate welcoming event on Sunday night, shouts of ‚ÄúBernie!‚Äù filled the air as his supporters circulated a petition to force convention organizers to hold an extended roll-call vote on the floor this week that would require each delegate to declare his or her support. Others pledged to contest Clinton‚Äôs choice of Democrat Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, as her running mate.  When at mid-day Sanders addressed more than a thousand of his delegates at the city‚Äôs convention center, the crowd erupted in fury when he asked them to switch their allegiance to Clinton. ‚ÄúBrothers and sisters,‚Äù he said over their jeers, ‚Äúthis is the real world that we live in. Trump is a bully and a demagogue.‚Äù People started shouting back: ‚ÄúSo is Hillary!‚Äù Sanders did not mention Clinton again. But he already had lost the attention of some of his most fervent fans. ‚ÄúAs soon as he said back Clinton, everyone stopped listening,‚Äù said Cindy Melchert, a protester who listened to the appeal over a loudspeaker at a local park. A Michigan native, Melchert said she would not vote for Clinton in November under any circumstances. For her, the movement now was less about Sanders and more about showing the Democratic National Committee ‚Äúthey had us and absolutely lost us.‚Äù Another protester, Michael Arnold of Atlanta, would not have been out of place at a Trump rally, sporting a T-shirt that read ‚ÄúHillary for prison.‚Äù  Fearing a similar scene on the convention floor would embarrass Clinton, Sanders‚Äô campaign emailed delegates before Monday night‚Äôs program, urging them to restrain themselves. ‚ÄúOur credibility as a movement will be damaged by booing, turning of backs, walking out or other similar displays,‚Äù it read. Some Sanders supporters appeared willing to set aside their qualms about Clinton, largely out of a desire to see Trump defeated in the election. Diana Hatsis-Neuhoff, a delegate from Florida adorned with buttons backing Sanders, said she planned to vote for Clinton in the general election. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll hold our nose and vote.‚Äù Others felt their fellow Sanders supporters had taken the movement too far. ‚ÄúWe are surrounded by people who are so selfish and so self-absorbed,‚Äù said Melissa Robbins, who worked for the Sanders campaign in Philadelphia. ‚ÄúNot voting for Hillary is a sure win for Donald Trump.‚Äù But that may not be enough to sway Sue Spicer from Indiana, who said she had trouble imagining voting for either Clinton or Trump. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to feel they have our best interests in mind,‚Äù she said.

"An Obama, not the president, brings down the house at Democratic convention","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Democrats divided over the future of their party agreed on at least one thing at their national convention in Philadelphia on Monday night: Michelle Obama was a star. The first lady gave a speech in support of a former first lady, presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, and described America as ‚Äúthe greatest country on earth‚Äù, clashing with Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù slogan and bringing an arena crowd riven by a fierce fight for the nomination to its feet. ‚ÄúI wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters - two beautiful, intelligent, black young women ‚Äì playing with their dogs on the White House lawn,‚Äù Michelle Obama said.  Obama‚Äôs husband, President Barack Obama, for years has drawn praise for his oratorical skills. But Monday night belonged to her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let anyone ever tell you that this country isn‚Äôt great, that somehow we need to make it great again, because this right now is the greatest country on earth,‚Äù she said. The speech triggered wild applause among delegates in the Wells Fargo Center, where anger over Senator Bernie Sanders‚Äô loss in the primary elections against Clinton had taken the form of jeers during speeches earlier in the day.  Some Sanders supporters had called out at some points early in Obama‚Äôs speech, but were shushed. Garry Mauro, head of the Clinton delegation for Texas, called Michelle Obama‚Äôs speech ‚Äústunningly good.‚Äù Several Twitter users said the speech brought them to tears, while others marveled at its positive tone in an election year marked by blunt exchanges.¬† ‚ÄúMrs. Obama deconstructed Trump‚Äôs entire campaign without using a single pejorative word,‚Äù Twitter user @weddady said in a post after the speech. ‚ÄúMrs Obama‚Äôs speech also disassembled Trump‚Äôs entire narrative without ever mentioning his name.‚Äù Michelle Obama became the top searched speaker of the night on Google.¬†On Twitter, about 40 tweets mentioning the first lady were posted every second, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.

I love you, Michelle,‚Äù he wrote in a Twitter post, using an acronym for first lady of the United States. His tweet became the most re-tweeted post of the night. Michelle Obama, a lawyer who has advocated for military families and working women during her seven-and-a-half years as first lady, has earned a reputation for inspirational speeches.  Last week, during the Republican National Convention, Trump‚Äôs wife Melania delivered a speech that appeared to borrow phrases from Michelle Obama‚Äôs convention speech in 2008, drawing accusations of plagiarism.

Email leak may hurt Democratic party chair's re-election bid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An email leak that led to the resignation of Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz could plague her bid for re-election to Congress, after a challenger said on Monday he would file a complaint alleging she had broken election rules. Political newcomer Tim Canova, who is challenging Wasserman Schultz in the Aug. 30 Democratic primary for her House of Representatives seat representing Florida‚Äôs 23rd Congressional District, said he would file the complaint against her with the U.S. Federal Election Commission. Wasserman Schultz said on Sunday she would be stepping down as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee after Wikileaks released more than 19,000 emails showing Democratic officials had worked to undermine U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in his presidential primary battle with Hillary Clinton. Canova suggested that the leaked emails also showed Wasserman Schultz had used the party‚Äôs resources in her congressional campaign against Canova in south Florida. Sanders has endorsed Canova in that race.  ‚ÄúThe Wikileaks emails indicate that¬†Debbie¬†Wasserman Schultz used DNC resources to assist her reelection campaign in violation of federal law. According to the emails, top DNC officials used party resources to monitor, respond to, and impede my campaign on numerous occasions,‚Äù Canova said in a statement emailed to Reuters by his campaign. ‚ÄúMy campaign election lawyers are investigating these circumstances and preparing a complaint against Wasserman Schultz with the Federal Election Commission,‚Äù Canova said. He also repeated his call for a series of campaign debates with Wasserman Schultz. Searching for Canova‚Äôs name in the cache of emails released by WikiLeaks turned up dozens of emails. One indicated Wasserman Schultz had asked staffers to take Canova‚Äôs name out of a headline on a statement that was being sent out in response to Sanders‚Äôs endorsement of Canova. Sanders told CNN in May that he favored Canova, saying ‚ÄúHis views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultz‚Äôs.‚Äù  Canova‚Äôs south Florida campaign for Congress has reflected some of the themes that Sanders used nationwide to appeal to progressives, including a push for campaign finance reform. Canova has also been a critic of financial deregulation and the Federal Reserve Board under former Chairman Alan Greenspan, according to his biography on the website at Nova Southeastern University, where he is a professor of law and public finance. Sanders made attacks on Wall Street a central theme of his presidential campaign, and called for structural reforms in the Fed. Since Sanders‚Äô endorsement, Canova has almost caught up with Wasserman Schultz in fundraising. Canova has raised $2.27 million so far; Wasserman Schultz has raised $2.81 million, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission filings.    There are also two Republicans seeking Wasserman Schultz‚Äôs seat in Congress, Martin Feigenbaum and Joe Kaufman. ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 "
Trump says he would consider alliance with Russia over Islamic State,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican nominee Donald Trump said on Monday that if elected U.S. president he would weigh an alliance with Russia against Islamic State militants but rejected any suggestion Russian President Vladimir Putin might be trying to help him win. Speaking at a rally in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Trump dismissed any suggestion that Putin‚Äôs intelligence services might have had a hand in hacking the Democratic National Committee‚Äôs email system. Emails leaked last week disclosed that some party officials had been in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton winning the Democratic presidential nomination over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and sought ways to thwart Sanders. The uproar over the WikiLeaks revelations prompted Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign as DNC chairwoman, and Trump eagerly injected himself into the controversy. Trump dismissed a charge from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook that Russian hackers might have stolen the emails and leaked them to embarrass Democrats and help Trump defeat Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here, and I think that‚Äôs disturbing,‚Äù Mook told CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union.‚Äù Trump dismissed what he called ‚Äúone of the weirdest conspiracy theories‚Äù he said he had heard. He said he had never met Putin. But over the course of his year-long campaign, Trump has praised the Russian leader and one of his top foreign policy advisers, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, had dinner with Putin last December. ‚ÄúWhen you think about it, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we got along with Russia?‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we got together with Russia and knocked the hell out of ISIS?‚Äù he added, using another name for Islamic State. As it happens, skeptics in the U.S. government, European allies in the anti-Islamic State coalition and the main Syrian opposition, distrustful of Russia‚Äôs intentions, are questioning Secretary of State John Kerry‚Äôs own latest proposal for closer U.S.-Russian cooperation against militant groups in Syria. Trump, kicking off a three-day campaign swing with his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, returned to his freewheeling style after giving a scripted speech on Thursday accepting the Republican presidential nomination. During an earlier event in Roanoke, Virginia, Trump labeled Clinton ‚Äúlow-energy,‚Äù the same characterization he lobbed at Republican rival Jeb Bush; attacked her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia; and complained about the air conditioning in the hotel ballroom where he spoke. ‚ÄúI think the ballroom and the people who own this hotel ought to be ashamed of themselves,‚Äù Trump said. Trump made light of Democratic disunity as party loyalists gathered in Philadelphia on Monday to anoint Clinton as their nominee this week, after a week in which Republicans struggled to unite behind Trump at their convention in Cleveland. Trump waved away Republican disunity as essentially isolated pockets of resistance and made an apparent reference to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who was booed in Cleveland when he would not endorse Trump after losing to him in a bitter primary race. ‚ÄúWe had a couple people who probably destroyed their career, but who knows,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúLook what‚Äôs going on in Philadelphia. ... We had no riots, no nothing. It was unbelievable. I‚Äôll never forget it as long as I live.‚Äù On Twitter, Trump added, ‚ÄúWow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 "
Democrats in disarray on eve of convention to nominate Clinton,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The head of the Democratic Party resigned on Sunday amid a furor over embarrassing leaked emails, hoping to head off a growing rebellion by Bernie Sanders supporters on the eve of the convention to nominate Hillary Clinton for the White House. Lingering bitterness from the heated primary campaign between Clinton and Sanders erupted after more than 19,000 Democratic National Committee emails, leaked on Friday, confirmed Sanders‚Äô frequent charge that the party played favorites in the race. In a statement, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the best way for the party to accomplish its goal of putting Clinton in the White House was for her to step aside after the convention. Sanders had demanded earlier in the day that Wasserman Schultz resign. The furor was a blow to a party keen on projecting stability in contrast to the volatility of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who was formally nominated at a raucous convention in Cleveland last week. It also overshadowed preparations in Philadelphia for Clinton‚Äôs coronation as the nominee to face Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election. She will be the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.  The four-day Democratic convention will open on Monday. In some good news for Clinton, The New York Times reported that businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will endorse her in a prime-time speech on Monday, saying she will be the best choice for moderate voters in 2016. The cache of emails leaked on Friday by the WikiLeaks website disclosed that DNC officials explored ways to undermine Sanders‚Äô insurgent presidential campaign, including raising questions about whether Sanders, who is Jewish, was really an atheist. Sanders said Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative from Florida, had made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party. ‚ÄúThe party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race,‚Äù he said. The Clinton camp questioned whether Russians may have had a hand in the hack attack on the party‚Äôs emails and were interested in helping Trump, who has exchanged words of praise with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs disturbing to us is that experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these emails and other experts are now saying that Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of helping Donald Trump,‚Äù Clinton campaign chairman Robby Mook said on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union.‚Äù Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the Clinton camp was trying to distract from its party discord ahead of the convention. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in those emails show that it was a clearly rigged system, that Bernie Sanders ... never had a chance,‚Äù Manafort said on ABC.  Clinton, 68, a former secretary of state, and Sanders, 74, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont who ran for president as a Democrat, waged a bruising months-long battle for the nomination. Branding himself a democratic socialist, Sanders galvanized young and liberal voters with his calls to rein in Wall Street and eradicate income inequality.    But Sanders repeatedly voiced frustration with a DNC and party establishment he felt was stacked against him, and the resentment from Sanders and his supporters threatened to disrupt the convention. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not shocked but I‚Äôm disappointed,‚Äù Sanders said of the emails earlier on Sunday on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù The emails showed DNC officials pondering various ways to undercut Sanders. Brad Marshall, the DNC‚Äôs chief financial officer, apologized on Facebook on Saturday for an email in which he discussed how some voters in upcoming nominating contests in Kentucky and West Virginia would reject an atheist. ‚ÄúHe had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage,‚Äù Marshall wrote in a May 5 email to three top DNC officials. No names were mentioned, but Sanders was the only Jewish candidate. ‚ÄúI think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.‚Äù Clinton told CBS‚Äôs ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù in an interview that aired on Sunday that she had not read any of the emails but it was ‚Äúwrong and unacceptable‚Äù to bring religion into the political process. The emails angered many Sanders supporters who were already dismayed by Clinton‚Äôs choice on Friday of low-key U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her vice presidential running mate. Kaine, 58, who could appeal to independents and moderates, has never been aligned with party liberals. Sanders, who has endorsed Clinton and will speak on her behalf to the convention on Monday, said he would have preferred she pick U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the party‚Äôs liberal wing, as her No. 2. ‚ÄúI have known Tim Kaine for a number of years. ... Tim is a very, very smart guy. He is a very nice guy,‚Äù Sanders said on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe is more conservative than I am. Would I have preferred to see somebody like an Elizabeth Warren selected by Secretary Clinton? Yes, I would have,‚Äù he said.  Carrying pitchforks meant to portray Clinton as the devil, hundreds of Sanders supporters took to the streets of Philadelphia earlier on Sunday to say they felt betrayed by the DNC. ‚ÄúIt just validated everything we thought, everything we believed to be true, that this was completely rigged right from the beginning, and that you know it was really about what they were doing everything to set it up so she would win,‚Äù Sanders supporter Gwen Sperling said. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election, the DNC said on Twitter. ",politicsNews,"July 24, 2016 "
"U.S. lawmaker wants new budget requests for Iraq, Afghanistan troops","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee called on the Obama administration on Monday to ask Congress for more money to fund its plans for Iraq and Afghanistan, amid expectations of a defense budget battle when lawmakers return to Washington this fall. ‚ÄúThe administration needs to come over with a supplemental (budget request),‚Äù Republican Representative Mac Thornberry said at a roundtable discussion with reporters shortly after returning from a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan. He said U.S. and allied forces were making progress in Afghanistan and in the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq, but that stiff challenges remained in both campaigns. Thornberry and other congressional Republicans have been saying President Barack Obama must formally request additional funds for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1 since he announced plans earlier this month to send more troops to Iraq and keep more in Afghanistan than had been expected. The request for more troops, without a plan to pay for them, added another wrinkle to the simmering dispute between the Republican-led Congress and the Democratic administration over spending. Obama has threatened to veto a $602 billion defense policy bill because of its use of special funds for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to avoid mandatory budget limits. Democrats say the Department of Defense should be subject to the same spending restrictions as non-military programs. Republicans accuse Democrats of stinting on national security in order to fund pet domestic projects. ‚ÄúThat is holding our military hostage,‚Äù Thornberry said. The congressman said he had had no official numbers from the Pentagon but that he had been told it faces roughly $6 billion more in expenses than when the administration made its budget request earlier this year. He said military commanders in Afghanistan were grappling with how to handle Obama‚Äôs plan to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 8,448 by December 31 from about 9,800 currently. They are looking into using more contractors and whether some functions can be moved out of Afghanistan, Thornberry said.  Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said the Pentagon was evaluating how to proceed, comparing its estimated costs with what is already in its budgets. ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 "
"Illinois Republican lawmaker resigns, cites Facebook, Twitter hacks","CHICAGO (Reuters) - A prominent Illinois Republican has resigned from the state legislature, citing multiple incidents of fake Facebook and Twitter accounts set up in his name in recent weeks.  ‚ÄúAfter some cyber security issues arose, I began to re-evaluate my continued public service,‚Äù Representative Ron Sandack, House Republican floor leader, said in a resignation letter dated Sunday and provided on Monday by the Republican Caucus. Sandack, known as an adamant defender of Republican Governor Bruce Rauner‚Äôs initiatives on the floor of the Democratic-dominated House, was up for re-election in November against Democrat Greg Hose. His resignation comes as both major U.S. political parties are increasingly bedeviled by hacking, including Friday‚Äôs leak of emails that have embarrassed Democrats as they gather for the party‚Äôs convention in Philadelphia this week. Sandack had been battling since July 4 to remove multiple fake Facebook and Twitter accounts in his name, he told Capitol Fax, a respected political blog based in Springfield, the state capital. It is not clear what, if anything, the fake accounts posted in his name. Sandack, who was an active user of social media, has shut down his Facebook and Twitter accounts and has filed a police report regarding the fake ones, Capitol Fax reported. A spokeswoman for Jim Durkin, leader of the House Republicans, did not respond to a question on who would replace Sandack as Republican candidate for his seat. Rauner did not respond to reporters‚Äô questions about Sandack following an event on Monday morning.  Sandack is a Chicago lawyer and former mayor of Downers Grove, Illinois. He was appointed in 2010 to the Illinois Senate to fill in for a senator who resigned, and went on to be elected as representative for his suburban Chicago district. In his resignation notice he also said he was no longer willing to miss so many family events. ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 "
"Democratic Party email leak points to Russia: cyber experts, U.S. officials","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said on Monday there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election. The FBI said it was investigating a cyber intrusion at the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which has led to discord as  the party‚Äôs convention in Philadelphia opens on Monday to nominate former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton as its candidate. Although the hacking of the DNC was known to officials and cyber security experts a month ago, the timing of the release of the contents of communications within the party is what is causing concern for U.S. authorities. A U.S. official involved in the investigation said that the classified information collected on the hack so far ‚Äúindicated beyond a reasonable doubt that it originated in Russia.‚Äù  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the timing of the release of emails ‚Äúhas all the hallmarks of a classic intelligence operation intended to damage a perceived adversary.‚Äù The official said, however, that it may be impossible to prove definitively that Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs government directed the attack. The emails, released by activist group WikiLeaks at the weekend, appeared to show favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race for the nomination for the Nov. 8 election. The committee is supposed to be neutral and the disclosure forced chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida, to resign. The U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee has been briefed and will seek information on any potential connection to Russia or any other state, said Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the panel. ‚ÄúThat foreign actors may be trying to influence our election - let alone a powerful adversary like Russia - should concern all Americans of any party.‚Äù Schiff said in a statement. On Sunday, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN that the campaign had been told by ‚Äúexperts‚Äù that the emails were released by suspected Russian hackers to help Republican Party nominee Donald Trump. The businessman‚Äôs campaign dismissed the allegation as absurd. Trump has often praised Putin, calling him a ‚Äústrong leader.‚Äù Trump is a critic of NATO and last week he  told The New York Times that he might not back countries in the alliance if they were attacked by Russia, unless he was sure they had made sufficient contributions to the group.  Russia has long been considered among the most elite U.S. adversaries in cyberspace, though its actions are generally viewed as efforts at covert intelligence gathering. ‚ÄúUsually, the Russians are not ham-handed,‚Äù said Jim Lewis, a cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said Russia was believed to have hacked Democratic and Republican campaigns in 2008, but that it did not leak material. ‚ÄúIt would be a bold move to try and shape the election, but we can‚Äôt rule it out,‚Äù Lewis said. CrowdStrike, a cyber firm that helped clean up the breach, said last month it had identified two hacking groups that infiltrated the DNC and that both were believed to be working on behalf of two competing arms of the Russian government. Its findings were later supported by similar conclusions reached by FireEye‚Äôs (FEYE.O) Mandiant unit and Fidelis, two other U.S.-based cyber companies.   Experts said that forensic analysis of the breach also links the same hackers to attacks at the White House, the State Department, the German Bundestag and private companies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to say when its probe of the hack began. ‚ÄúA compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,‚Äù it said in a statement. WikiLeaks released more than 19,000 DNC emails on Saturday. On Twitter it rejected as speculation claims made that Russia was the source of the cache. The group also said that there would be more leaks related to the U.S. election. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he could not speak to the veracity of private sector conclusions pointing to Russia as the culprit in the DNC hack, but that he was confident the FBI would thoroughly investigate the matter.

Florida man admits helping funnel 2012 foreign political contribution,"(Reuters) - A Florida man pleaded guilty on Monday to working with another man to illegally funnel $80,000 in foreign contributions to U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs joint fundraising committee in 2012 so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event. William Argeros, 57, pleaded guilty in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, to charges that he knowingly and willfully made foreign contributions and donations and made a false  declaration to a federal grand jury, prosecutors said. U.S. law prohibits contributions from foreign nationals to candidates or fundraising committees in federal elections. A lawyer for Argeros did not respond to a request for comment. The Tampa, Florida, resident is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 9. The proceedings came a month after an earlier guilty plea in the case by Bilal Shehu, a New Jersey limousine driver to whom prosecutors said Argeros facilitated the transferring of $80,000 from a foreign source. Prosecutors said Shehu, a Paramus, New Jersey resident, then provided the money to Obama‚Äôs joint fundraising committee so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event on Oct. 8, 2012, in San Francisco. In announcing both guilty pleas, prosecutors have not specifically identified the foreign source of the money or the foreign national. But the cases came after a Republican congressman in 2013 called for investigations into the purchases by Shehu‚Äôs family of two $40,000 tickets for a San Francisco fundraiser, one of which was used by now-Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. At the October 2012 event, Rama, the Albanian Socialist Party leader, was photographed with Obama. U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California at the time contended the photo was then used for ‚Äúdeceitful‚Äù purposes by Rama to imply a relationship with Obama during Albania‚Äôs own election, which brought him into leadership. Prosecutors have said that the foreign national in the case was denied entry to the campaign event but was allowed to be photographed with Obama. Prosecutors said no one on the joint election committee has been accused of any wrongdoing and that it had cooperated fully in the investigation. ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 "

Democrats in disarray on eve of convention to nominate Clinton,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The head of the Democratic Party resigned on Sunday amid a furor over embarrassing leaked emails, hoping to head off a growing rebellion by Bernie Sanders supporters on the eve of the convention to nominate Hillary Clinton for the White House. Lingering bitterness from the heated primary campaign between Clinton and Sanders erupted after more than 19,000 Democratic National Committee emails, leaked on Friday, confirmed Sanders‚Äô frequent charge that the party played favorites in the race. In a statement, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the best way for the party to accomplish its goal of putting Clinton in the White House was for her to step aside after the convention. Sanders had demanded earlier in the day that Wasserman Schultz resign. The furor was a blow to a party keen on projecting stability in contrast to the volatility of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who was formally nominated at a raucous convention in Cleveland last week. It also overshadowed preparations in Philadelphia for Clinton‚Äôs coronation as the nominee to face Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election. She will be the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.  The four-day Democratic convention will open on Monday. In some good news for Clinton, The New York Times reported that businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will endorse her in a prime-time speech on Monday, saying she will be the best choice for moderate voters in 2016. The cache of emails leaked on Friday by the WikiLeaks website disclosed that DNC officials explored ways to undermine Sanders‚Äô insurgent presidential campaign, including raising questions about whether Sanders, who is Jewish, was really an atheist. Sanders said Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative from Florida, had made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party. ‚ÄúThe party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race,‚Äù he said. The Clinton camp questioned whether Russians may have had a hand in the hack attack on the party‚Äôs emails and were interested in helping Trump, who has exchanged words of praise with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs disturbing to us is that experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these emails and other experts are now saying that Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of helping Donald Trump,‚Äù Clinton campaign chairman Robby Mook said on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union.‚Äù Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the Clinton camp was trying to distract from its party discord ahead of the convention. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in those emails show that it was a clearly rigged system, that Bernie Sanders ... never had a chance,‚Äù Manafort said on ABC.  Clinton, 68, a former secretary of state, and Sanders, 74, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont who ran for president as a Democrat, waged a bruising months-long battle for the nomination. Branding himself a democratic socialist, Sanders galvanized young and liberal voters with his calls to rein in Wall Street and eradicate income inequality.    But Sanders repeatedly voiced frustration with a DNC and party establishment he felt was stacked against him, and the resentment from Sanders and his supporters threatened to disrupt the convention. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not shocked but I‚Äôm disappointed,‚Äù Sanders said of the emails earlier on Sunday on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù The emails showed DNC officials pondering various ways to undercut Sanders. Brad Marshall, the DNC‚Äôs chief financial officer, apologized on Facebook on Saturday for an email in which he discussed how some voters in upcoming nominating contests in Kentucky and West Virginia would reject an atheist. ‚ÄúHe had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage,‚Äù Marshall wrote in a May 5 email to three top DNC officials.

"Attacking Trump, Democrat Kaine makes campaign-trail debut","MIAMI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Tim Kaine made his first appearance on the campaign trail as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs vice presidential running mate on Saturday, touting an optimistic view of America and leaping to attack Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs record. Joining Clinton at a rally in the battleground state of Florida, the bilingual Kaine peppered Spanish-language phrases into a speech focused on introducing himself to voters unfamiliar with the low-key U.S. senator from Virginia. Kaine criticized Trump‚Äôs recent suggestion he might not honor U.S. security commitments to NATO in Europe, and the real estate mogul‚Äôs history of casino bankruptcies and founding the failed Trump University. ‚ÄúWhen Donald Trump says he has your back, you better watch out,‚Äù Kaine said, with Clinton sitting at his side nodding. ‚ÄúHe leaves a trail of broken promises and wrecked lives wherever he goes. We can‚Äôt afford to let him do the same thing to our country.‚Äù In contrast, he said, Clinton ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt insult people, she listens to them. What a novel concept.‚Äù He said they shared a common creed: ‚ÄúDo all the good you can.‚Äù Clinton unveiled her choice of Kaine late on Friday, grabbing the political spotlight from Trump, who accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday night after a chaotic four-day convention. The former secretary of state will formally be nominated as her party‚Äôs presidential candidate in the Nov. 8 election at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, which opens on Monday. In choosing the soft-spoken Kaine, a former Richmond mayor and Virginia governor with a long establishment resume, Clinton opted for a steady and experienced hand who she hopes will offer a clear alternative to Trump‚Äôs volatile campaign and his Republican vice presidential choice Mike Pence. ‚ÄúSenator Tim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not. He is qualified to step into this job and lead on day one,‚Äù Clinton told the Miami crowd. Trump was unimpressed, saying on Twitter he had watched the joint appearance and ‚ÄúISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don‚Äôt look presidential to me!‚Äù In his speech, Kaine said he was an optimist and described his childhood in Kansas City helping his father in his metal-working shop and his Catholic mission to Honduras, where he helped teenagers with carpentry and welding and they taught him Spanish. He said in Honduras he learned the values ‚ÄúFe, familia, y trabajo‚Äù ‚Äî faith, family, and work. Kaine became emotional when he recalled the 2007 shooting deaths of 32 people at Virginia Tech University during his stint as governor, calling it the worst day of his life. He promised to take on the National Rifle Association and fight for ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù gun control. Judith Sweeney, 58, from West Park, Florida, said she knew little about Kaine before attending the speech but was impressed by his resume and liked his civil rights work and school reform efforts. ‚ÄúWonderful, very experienced, an innovator,‚Äù she said. Peter Daou, a former adviser to Clinton who now owns a media company, said Kaine‚Äôs speech would turn around some of the doubters about the choice. ‚ÄúThe combination of his tone, his demeanor, his life story -it just said a lot about her capacity to choose the right person and not listen to pressure from the outside,‚Äù he said. Clinton is hoping Kaine will help her appeal to independents and moderates, but some supporters of Clinton‚Äôs Democratic primary rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, were dismayed by the choice because of Kaine‚Äôs past advocacy for an Asian free-trade pact. But in a nod to party liberals, the Clinton campaign said Kaine will not support the final version of the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership, which is pending in the Senate. A spokeswoman for Kaine confirmed his opposition to the pact. The decision drew cheers from liberal groups and labor leaders. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad to see the Clinton-Kaine ticket taking steps to campaign on big, bold, populist ideas that voters want to hear from Democrats,‚Äù said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progessive Change Campaign Committee. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said Kaine‚Äôs decision to join Clinton in opposing the trade pact ‚Äúsets an irretrievable, progressive path forward for America.‚Äù In picking Kaine, Clinton passed over liberal candidates who would have generated more grassroots enthusiasm like U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Hispanic Cabinet members Julian Castro and Thomas Perez. Clinton tried to reassure party liberals, offering an extended list of Kaine‚Äôs efforts on behalf of low-income workers, education and civil rights, and for expanded gun control laws and immigration reform. ‚ÄúHe fights for the people he represents, and he delivers real results,‚Äù Clinton said, applying one of her favorite self-descriptions to him. ‚ÄúWhen I say he‚Äôs a progressive who likes to get things done, I mean it.‚Äù Sanders supporters lost their bid to eliminate or reduce the influence of superdelegates, party leaders who are not bound to any candidate, during a meeting of the convention rules committee in Philadelphia. Sanders had complained about the superdelegates, which overwhelmingly backed Clinton. But enough committee members backed the effort to let them take the fight to the convention floor during next week‚Äôs convention, participants said.   ",politicsNews,"July 23, 2016 "

"Democrat Clinton picks Kaine as running mate, bypassing liberals","WASHINGTON/TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton named U.S. Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate on Friday, opting for an experienced governing partner who will help her present the Democratic ticket as a steady alternative to the unpredictable campaign of Republican presidential rival Donald Trump. The selection of Kaine, a self-described ‚Äúboring‚Äù Virginian with a reputation for low-key competence, could appeal to independents and moderates, but it quickly angered liberal groups that object to his advocacy for an Asian free-trade pact. The Spanish-speaking former Virginia governor and Richmond mayor fit Clinton‚Äôs long-stated criteria that the vice presidential choice be a capable and reliable partner who is ready to take over the presidency if necessary. Clinton made the announcement via Twitter and a text message to supporters after the first day of a two-day campaign swing in Florida. She called Kaine to tell him about 40 minutes before the announcement, and called President Barack Obama shortly after Kaine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled to tell you this first: I‚Äôve chosen Sen. Tim Kaine as my running mate. Welcome him to my team,‚Äù she said in her text message. Kaine, 58, edged out two other finalists - Cory Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, according to a Democratic source familiar with the discussions. Clinton also bypassed candidates who would have generated more excitement among liberal and Hispanic activists, including progressive favorite U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and two Hispanic members of Obama‚Äôs Cabinet, Julian Castro and Thomas Perez. The former secretary of state will be formally nominated as the party‚Äôs presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election at next week‚Äôs Democratic convention in Philadelphia. She leads Trump in many opinion polls. Clinton‚Äôs choice of a running mate could give her campaign momentum heading into the convention, as the fight for the White House begins a more than three-month push to the finish.             Clinton, 68, acknowledged in an interview earlier this week that even Kaine admits he is boring, and said she did not mind. ‚ÄúI love that about him,‚Äù she told Charlie Rose of CBS News and PBS. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs never lost an election. He was a world-class mayor, governor and senator and is one of the most highly respected senators I know.‚Äù A campaign official said Clinton was impressed with Kaine‚Äôs down-to-earth style when she campaigned with him in Virginia last week. Afterwards, Kaine went back to her house in Washington, D.C., for a 90-minute evening meeting. Two days later, Kaine and his wife, Anne, joined Clinton in New York for lunch, along with Clinton‚Äôs husband, former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea and Chelsea‚Äôs husband. Kaine was the only vice presidential candidate to have a private family lunch during the vetting process, the official said. Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, John Podesta, who led the search, offered her advice. ‚ÄúIt needs to be someone who whenever they walk into a room you are glad to see them and want to have them as part of any conversation,‚Äù the campaign official quoted Podesta telling her. Kaine‚Äôs first appearance with Clinton will be on Saturday at an event in Miami, a campaign aide said. ‚ÄúJust got off the phone with Hillary. I‚Äôm honored to be her running mate. Can‚Äôt wait to hit the trail tomorrow in Miami,‚Äù Kaine said on Twitter. Liberal groups, which had pressured Clinton not to pick Kaine because of his support for fast-track authority for the White House to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, were dismayed by the choice. Critics of the Asia free-trade deal, including Trump and Clinton‚Äôs Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders, say it would be unfair to U.S. workers and kill jobs. Clinton praised the deal when she was secretary of state, but has since distanced herself from it. ‚ÄúRepublicans will run hard against Democrats on trade this year. Unfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue,‚Äù said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Hispanic activists also may be annoyed with the pick of Kaine given that Latino candidates were again passed over, though some Latino advocacy groups praised the choice. ‚ÄúShe has chosen a running mate that has a track record of advocating and fighting for the issues that affect the Latino community and our nation: immigration, healthcare, women‚Äôs rights and the environment,‚Äù said Ben Monterroso, executive director of Mi Familia Vota.  Top Republicans were quick to criticize Clinton‚Äôs choice. The Trump campaign called Kaine ‚Äúan ethically challenged insider‚Äù and called Clinton and Kaine a ‚ÄúStatus Quo‚Äù ticket. ‚ÄúIf you think Crooked Hillary and Corrupt Kaine are going to change anything in Washington, it‚Äôs just the opposite,‚Äù campaign aide Jason Miller said in a statement. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus condemned the pick, saying Clinton spent the past week pandering to Sanders and grassroots Democrats, and now ‚Äúhas chosen someone who holds positions that she‚Äôs spent the entire primary trying to get to the left of.‚Äù But Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has been critical of Trump, said on Twitter that he was trying to count the ways he hated Tim Kaine. ‚ÄúDrawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend,‚Äù Flake said.  Kaine could help Clinton in Virginia, a heavily contested swing state, and choosing Kaine will not cost Democrats a seat in the Senate, where Republicans now hold a majority. Virginia‚Äôs Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton friend and ally, will name a replacement for Kaine if he and Clinton win the White House. Some Democrats who know Kaine well dismissed fears that he lacks the toughness to stand up to Republican attacks, given how deftly Trump chewed up ‚Äúlow-energy‚Äù Jeb Bush and ‚Äúlittle Marco‚Äù Rubio in the Republican primaries. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the Donald Trump sledgehammer. But he‚Äôs not a shrinking violet,‚Äù said Luke Albee, a former chief of staff to Democrat Mark Warner, the senior U.S. senator from Virginia. ¬†¬†¬† Albee, who has watched Kaine up close over the years, added, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mistake a thoughtful and genial disposition for an inability to really forcefully articulate differences.‚Äù Kaine has good relations with senators from the opposing party, according to senior Senate Republican congressional aides. One aide speculated Kaine would be effective in reaching out to congressional Republicans if he becomes vice president, a role that Vice President Joe Biden has played for Obama. Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, has been a leading voice calling for a formal authorization of war against the Islamic State militant group. He played an important role in securing congressional review of the 2015 international deal on Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, although he eventually backed it. He has a track-record of backing liberal causes such as ending across-the-board automatic budget cuts and providing a pathway to citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants.        Kaine, a Catholic who became fluent in Spanish speaker while serving as a missionary in Honduras, has expressed personal opposition to abortion, but has a public record in support of abortion rights.

Trump pulls nearly even with Clinton after Republican convention: Reuters/Ipsos poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pulled nearly even with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for the first time since May, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken over the course of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week.  The July 18-22 national online poll found that 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 38 percent supported Trump. Given the poll‚Äôs credibility interval of about 4 percentage points, Trump and Clinton should be considered to be about even in the race.  MORE ELECTION 2016 COVERAGE: Just before Republicans opened the convention on Monday, Trump had trailed Clinton by nearly 10 percentage points in the poll.  The New York businessman-turned-politician formally accepted the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election during a convention at which the party at times struggled to show unity.  The week started with a dustup between convention leaders and delegates who wanted to change the party‚Äôs rules to derail Trump‚Äôs nomination. Later in the week, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who dropped out of the nomination race in May, refused to endorse Trump in a prime-time speech.  Yet, on the final night of the convention, Republicans gave Trump a standing ovation as he pledged to take back a country that he said is plagued by crime, terrorism and ineffective leadership.  Party conventions are partly meant to introduce the candidate to the country, and nominees tend to get a boost in opinion polls afterward. In 2012, then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney rose by about 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos poll after his party‚Äôs convention.  Clinton, who is expected to be formally nominated by her party at its convention in Philadelphia next week, has led Trump most of the year in the poll.  The last time Trump drew about even with Clinton was in mid-May, after his last two rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out of the race and party leaders started to get behind his campaign.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in English in all 50 states with 1,036 likely voters.  ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 "
Women in male-dominated career fields watch a unique U.S. presidential campaign,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dr. Linda Liau works with the precision of a master, peering into a patient‚Äôs head with magnifying loupes as she removes a brain tumor. When Liau was called into an emergency room as a surgeon more than 20 years ago to help treat a car crash victim, another member of the medical team assumed she was a nurse. Even today, the 49-year-old neurosurgeon sometimes gets a surprised reaction from new patients who were expecting a man.  Such an assumption is common in career fields dominated by men. Neurosurgery, welding, venture capitalism, construction, film directing and the electrical trade - these are six jobs where U.S. women have made inroads but are still vastly outnumbered. And one position, U.S. president, has never been filled by a woman. With presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton seeking to become the first to break that barrier, several women in career fields made up mostly of men told Reuters that they saw her candidacy as significant. ‚ÄúI think ultimately the goal would be to be gender-blind completely, so the fact that we‚Äôre even talking about having a female president as a novelty is, in a way, sad,‚Äù Liau said. On a construction site, Joundi White, 31, has often been reminded of her gender. Early in her career, the reminders were pet names such as ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù and ‚Äúhoney.‚Äù Now, she can rarely shake the sense that she is outnumbered. ‚ÄúI eat lunch alone,‚Äù White said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have people to relate to at work.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I identify more with the guys, but to them, ultimately, I‚Äôm just a girl.‚Äù Wearing a hard hat, White passes under heavy steel beams, walking along the commuter train tracks she is helping build in her working-class neighborhood in southern Los Angeles.  Welder Darlene Thompson, 45, is also no stranger to the construction site, or to the hostility that she says women often encounter in the field. These days, she teaches others as an instructor at Los Angeles Trade Technical College.  In a heavy coat and blue gloves, she looks from under her helmet at the white-hot flame of a welding torch.  It was a fight to learn these skills. More than a decade ago, when she began receiving job training as a welfare recipient, Thompson had to argue for the chance to study welding. Public assistance administrators wanted to push her toward cosmetology or culinary arts, she said.  Thompson did not say how she would cast her ballot in November but said she would not vote for Clinton just because the candidate is a woman. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs slogan has resonated with her. ‚ÄúWhen they talk about ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs make America great again,‚Äô‚Äù Thompson said, ‚Äúwhat I think of is the companies in Detroit, the automotive industry going back to Detroit and giving back jobs.‚Äù A well-paid job as an electrician has opened up opportunities for Hannah Cooper, 28. For one thing, she was able to buy a house in the expensive Los Angeles real estate market. Sometimes, she will encounter someone on a construction site who knows her mother, Kelly Cooper, who also was an electrician.  ‚ÄúEveryone remembers her because there‚Äôs only a few women,‚Äù Cooper said. Kelly Cooper began as an apprentice in 1975. ‚ÄúYou have to have thick skin to be anyone in the trade,‚Äùshe said. ‚ÄúTo be a woman in the trade, you have to have a particularly thick skin.‚Äù  She is now director of construction for the Los Angeles Department of General Services. Eva Ho, 44, is a woman working in the technology field, which is unusual enough. But she is also a venture capitalist, which is rarer still. ‚ÄúIn some ways the V.C. career has really been an old boys club, and it‚Äôs been dominated by white men for the last three or four decades,‚Äù Ho said.  A graduate of Harvard and Cornell, Ho said she was drawn to work in technology because of its ability to drive social change. But she came late to it, never having used a computer until college. For the Burtons, who work together as filmmakers through their company Five Sisters Productions, their career had its seeds in their childhood as the daughters of a writer and a former professional musician.  Both parents were feminists who thought their five daughters could do anything, said Ursula Burton, a director, producer and actor.  Now the possibility of a female president could help create more opportunities for women, she said.  ‚ÄúHaving a woman president opens up the presidency for girls,‚Äù Burton said, ‚Äúand it will shift the perception for boys of what girls can do.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"July 23, 2016 "
Hungary's Orban likes what he hears of 'valiant' Trump's security plans,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Saturday said Donald Trump had proposed security policies that Europe should take to heart to solve a security crisis he blames on uncontrolled immigration. Speaking at a summer university in Baile Tusnad, Romania, the Hungarian leader tied increased security threats to increased migration and cited Trump‚Äôs proposals at the Republican National Convention to combat terrorism. Orban is one of Europe‚Äôs most outspoken politicians and has in the past upset fellow members of the European Union over policy. Most recently he has taken a tough stance on Europe‚Äôs  migrant crisis, objecting to EU resettlement plans and calling for a razor wire fence to be built along his country‚Äôs southern border. Trump accepted the Republican nomination for president on Thursday with a speech that outlined an increased intelligence effort, an end to a ‚Äúfailed policy of nation-building and regime change‚Äù and a total suspension of immigration from states ‚Äúcompromised by terrorism.‚Äù He wants a wall to be built along the U.S. border with Mexico. Orban sought to buttress his own security proposals with Trump‚Äôs points. ‚ÄúI am not a Donald Trump campaigner,‚Äù he said in the televised speech. ‚ÄúI never thought I would ever entertain the thought that, of the open options, he (Trump) would be better for Europe and for Hungary. ‚ÄúBut I listened to the candidate and I must tell you he made three proposals to combat terrorism. And as a European I could have hardly articulated better what Europe needs.‚Äù Orban has accused the EU of weakness in the face of a what he sees as a fundamental threat from more than a million migrants who arrived on the continent last year, with hundreds of thousands following them this year. For the most part, the migrants are fleeing the war in Syria. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called Orban ‚ÄúViktator‚Äù - a pun on Viktor and dictator - as a way of putting down the Hungarian‚Äôs views. But Orban also has supporters. Slovak premier Robert Fico, joined Orban‚Äôs court challenge of the EU‚Äôs mandatory migrant resettlement quotas. Tapping into Trump‚Äôs proposals to create ‚Äúthe best intelligence-gathering organisation in the world,‚Äù Orban said that Europe too needs to create a network of national intelligence agencies that ranks with the world‚Äôs best. He then took aim at some of his EU colleagues. ‚ÄúThe second thing, said this valiant American presidential candidate, is to abandon the policy of exporting democracy. I could not have said it more precisely.‚Äù Orban said Western countries acted recklessly to remove the undemocratic but stable regimes in Libya, Syria and Iraq without guaranteeing stability in the aftermath, exposing Europe to a mass wave of migration. Worse, he said, instead of supporting the regimes that try to control the civil-war-torn countries in North Africa and the Middle East, Europe criticises them for democratic shortfalls. ‚ÄúIf we keep prioritising democracy over stability in regions where we are unlikely to succeed with that, we will create instability, not democracy.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 23, 2016 "
Alaska's top court rejects parental notice for abortions,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - An Alaska law requiring doctors to notify the parents of girls under the age of 18 seeking an abortion violates the state‚Äôs constitution and cannot be enforced, the state‚Äôs top court ruled on Friday. The 4-1 decision marks a long-awaited victory for Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights advocates in Alaska who argued the 2010 law violates the privacy of pregnant teens. It also comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of abortion rights in America in more than two decades. A woman‚Äôs right to abortion was established in the court‚Äôs landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, but several states have tried to restrict access to abortion through their own laws.  In Alaska, Planned Parenthood and doctors argued that the notification law was particularly threatening to vulnerable teens who live in abusive homes. Justice Daniel Winfree, writing for the majority, said that the notification law‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscriminatory barrier to those minors seeking to exercise their fundamental privacy right to terminate a pregnancy violates Alaska‚Äôs equal protection guarantee.‚Äù Another justice, Dana Fabe, in a concurring opinion, wrote that ‚Äúthe Alaska Constitution permits a parental notification law, but not one that contains provisions that are among the most restrictive of any state‚Äôs notification laws.‚Äù The office of Alaska‚Äôs Attorney General did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Alaska‚Äôs law required 48-hour advance notice to parents before a physician may terminate a minor‚Äôs pregnancy, though it allowed a minor to seek a judge‚Äôs permission to bypass the notice process and granted an exception for medical emergencies. The law took effect in 2010 after a Superior Court ruled that the state had an interest in promoting communication between a pregnant girl and her family. Christine Charbonneau, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands, said in a statement that ‚ÄúWe all want teens to be safe - and the sad truth is that some teens live in dangerous homes and can‚Äôt go to their parents.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 23, 2016 "
Kaine's crime-busting past may hurt Clinton's outreach to blacks,"RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs pick of Tim Kaine as her vice presidential running mate could hamper her efforts to reach out to African-American voters because of Kaine‚Äôs past embrace of crime-fighting strategies that have driven up the U.S. prison population and are unpopular in the black community. The now-defunct Project Exile that Kaine backed was so unusual it was championed by Republicans and Democrats alike and by both the top U.S. gun lobby group and gun-control advocates. But the federal program launched in 1997 in Richmond, Virginia, was also criticized at the time as a racially biased initiative that condemned young black men to lengthy prison terms. Clinton has come under fire herself from black activists for her past support for tough-on-crime policies of the 1990s now blamed for a surge in U.S. prison population and heightened tensions between law enforcement and black communities. One of her fundraisers got disrupted earlier this year by activists who asked her to ‚Äúapologize for mass incarceration.‚Äù  Clinton named Kaine as her running mate late on Friday, making what is considered a safe choice for her battle against Republican presidential rival Donald Trump. As Richmond mayor from 1998 to 2001, Kaine, 58, was a vocal supporter of Project Exile, crediting it with reducing the city‚Äôs murder rate. Its goal was to literally live up to its name by making illegal gun possession a federal, not a state, crime, which allowed prosecutors to send convicted felons, most of them black, to a distant federal penitentiary for at least five years. Sam Sinyangwe, co-founder of Campaign Zero, a group focused on curtailing police violence, said Kaine‚Äôs choice could exacerbate Clinton‚Äôs problems rallying support of African-Americans, particularly younger people. ‚ÄúTo select somebody like (Kaine) is not a sign of good leadership potential in a president,‚Äù Sinyangwe said. Nicole Lee, a civil-rights lawyer and activist in Washington, D.C. who is African-American, also expressed concern. ‚ÄúProject Exile broke black families,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is not a benign thing to be for. These measures were not used against white kids in the suburbs with guns, they were used against black kids in the cities.‚Äù To defeat Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election, Clinton needs high turnout among blacks and other minority voters to offset Trump‚Äôs popularity among white voters. During the 1990s, she supported tough-on-crime initiatives backed by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, but now vows to ‚Äúend the era of mass incarceration.‚Äù Her campaign is trying to walk a political tightrope after the killings of two black men by police and the shooting deaths of police officers in Texas and Louisiana. She has offered support for the Black Lives Matter movement, while also strongly condemning the killings of police officers. Officials who were in Richmond during Kaine‚Äôs mayoral tenure believe the community, ravaged by the crack-cocaine epidemic and an escalating murder rate, had to take dramatic steps. Amy Dudley, a spokeswoman in Kaine‚Äôs Senate office, said the senator stood by the program, believing that it reduced gun violence. Jerry Oliver, the police chief at the time and an African-American, said the program focused on black communities out of necessity. ‚ÄúWe had to be where the problems were,‚Äù he said.  The National Rifle Association, the nation‚Äôs biggest gun lobby, was an early proponent of Project Exile as was the gun-control advocacy group Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.  As Richmond‚Äôs first white mayor in more than a decade, Kaine was widely credited for helping to bridge racial divisions in the city, but Project Exile drew fire from defense lawyers and community advocates who argued that the program unfairly targeted African-Americans. Kevin Ring, vice president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a Washington advocacy group lobbying against federal sentencing minimums, said that Kaine, like Clinton, will have to demonstrate to black voters that he has ‚Äúevolved‚Äù on the issue.  ‚ÄúThere are some that will be bothered. There will be questions,‚Äù Ring said. Kaine supports legislation that would roll back some mandatory minimum federal sentences and give judges more discretion, although his office says he still supports firm sentences for illegal gun possession. Kaine‚Äôs backing of Project Exile also makes him odd bedfellows with Trump, who has made law and order a central theme of his candidacy. Trump has called for the program‚Äôs revival and his campaign website said it was ‚Äútremendous.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 23, 2016 "
Judge tentatively rejects bid to toss Trump University lawsuit,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday tentatively rejected Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs bid to dismiss a lawsuit by Trump University students who said they were defrauded through its real-estate seminars. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego told a hearing he would take under consideration arguments on both sides in the case and issue a written ruling in the coming weeks.  The 2013 lawsuit, one of three over the defunct Trump University venture, was filed on behalf of students who paid up to $35,000 to learn Trump‚Äôs real estate investing ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù from his ‚Äúhand-picked‚Äù instructors.  The plaintiffs have sought class-action status. The cases against Trump University have regularly cropped up during the presidential campaign. Trump was roundly criticized in May when he accused Curiel, who is of Mexican descent, of being biased against him because of the candidate‚Äôs pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico.  Curiel, who was born in Indiana, is presiding over two of the cases, with one set for trial in late November. A separate lawsuit by New York‚Äôs attorney general is pending in that state. Trump‚Äôs lawyers say Curiel should toss the 2013 California lawsuit on the grounds that the New York real estate mogul, though personally involved in developing the concept and curriculum, relied on other executives to manage Trump University by the time the plaintiffs purchased their seminars. ‚ÄúBy 2007, his involvement was fairly minimal. He was not the person running this company. He founded it, he established it and he went off and let other people run it. It‚Äôs like any other celebrity endorsement,‚Äù Trump attorney Daniel Petrocelli said during the hearing. Trump‚Äôs lawyers claim references in marketing materials to ‚Äúsecrets,‚Äù ‚Äúhand-picked‚Äù instructors or ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù were mere sales ‚Äúpuffery.‚Äù According to the defense, there is no evidence Trump intended to defraud students. Lawyers for the students say the wealthy developer conducted the marketing for Trump University more than anyone else, starring in and approving promotional materials. They claim Trump University instructors were high-pressure sales people, not ‚Äúprofessors and adjunct professors‚Äù as Trump touted, and that New York authorities told Trump back in 2005 to stop calling his unaccredited venture a university.  ‚ÄúSomehow, belligerence trumps substance,‚Äù plaintiff‚Äôs attorney Jason Forge said. ‚ÄúIf we say it loud enough, forcefully enough, it becomes true. Well, it doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, plaintiffs‚Äô court papers say. ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 "
Obama signs into law opioid addiction bill to protect newborns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law a measure that pledges greater efforts to protect drug-dependent newborns and assist their parents. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act also stresses drug treatment and overdose prevention to help stanch the nation‚Äôs heroin and opioid drug epidemic. Obama said in a statement that 78 Americans die from opioid overdose every day, and noted that the legislation included only modest steps to address the epidemic. ‚ÄúI am deeply disappointed that Republicans failed to provide any real resources for those seeking addiction treatment to get the care that they need,‚Äù Obama said.¬†‚ÄúIn fact, they blocked efforts by Democrats to include $920 million in treatment funding.‚Äù The bill was passed nearly unanimously by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Efforts to enforce provisions to protect newborns and help their parents come in response to a Reuters investigation last year titled ‚ÄúHelpless & Hooked.‚Äù The new law requires that the federal government and every state follow a 2003 law that was routinely ignored. That law called on states to require hospitals and social services to report, track and assist drug-dependent newborns and their families. Reuters found that no more than nine states were following that requirement. Most children born to addicted mothers, including many mothers who were taking prescribed methadone, were not being reported by hospitals as required by law. Often, that was because medical workers feared involving child protective services, as the existing law requires. When cases were reported to social services, Reuters found, efforts to protect the child and help the parents often were limited. The failures came at a cost. Reuters found more than 110 babies since 2010 died under preventable circumstances after being sent home to families ill-equipped to care for them. Experts said far more children have likely died but gone uncounted. The new law promises a non-punitive approach that includes ‚Äúsafe care plans‚Äù aimed at keeping newborns at home with their parents, who will receive additional help. ‚ÄúThis is a step forward for vulnerable babies who, due to an opioid dependency, will begin their lives facing enormous challenges,‚Äù said Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, the ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee on children and families. ‚ÄúReuters‚Äô initial reporting shined a light on a darkness that had enveloped far too many lives. There is much more work to do but this is a genuine step forward.‚Äù Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican who chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which initiated the measure, said it will track state actions. ‚ÄúThese reforms are an important part of our broader efforts to combat the nation‚Äôs opioid epidemic and provide these vulnerable families a better chance at a brighter future,‚Äù Kline said in a statement. In 2013, the latest year with nationwide hospital reporting, 27,315 babies were diagnosed with newborn drug withdrawal syndrome, a five-fold increase from a decade earlier. Reuters found that one drug-dependent baby was born on average every 19 minutes in the United States. Some suffer shaking, crying and feeding problems as they battle withdrawal. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the broader addiction law was ‚Äúno more than a half measure‚Äù without more funding. Wyden has co-sponsored a measure setting aside money for substance abuse treatment for parents in danger of losing their children. It passed the House but stalled in the Senate. Jim Greenwood, a former Pennsylvania congressman who championed the 2003 law, said the deaths Reuters revealed represent ‚Äúa national disgrace and glaring failure at the federal, state and local level to implement Plans of Safe Care for infants.‚Äù Greenwood, now president of a Washington, D.C.-based biotechnology group, applauded the new measure ‚Äúto improve the health and safety of these babies and their families.‚Äù Stephen Patrick, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University and leading researcher on the condition, said the new law is ‚Äúgood news‚Äù but added: ‚ÄúWish there was funding that came with it.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 "
Trump leaves some on Wall Street wary and confused," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump has said a lot of things that, were he a sitting U.S. president instead of a candidate for the job, could be expected to roil financial markets.  If investors were taking the Republican presidential nominee at his word, they would be selling shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Ford Motor Co (F.N), and cashing out of Mexican equities - all targets of Trump threats of boycotts, barrier walls or import taxes. Investors betting on a Trump presidency would be buying shares of U.S. companies that dealt exclusively with domestic customers and suppliers.  Yet the Trump trade is not much in evidence on Wall Street, where some market strategists and investors told Reuters they find it difficult to position their portfolios for his possible presidency, in part because many of his proposals are contradictory or lack specific implementation details.  MORE BUSINESS COVERAGE: Ex-Goldman banker Gordon Dyal beefs up M&A boutique Amazon makes its debut in the¬†student loan business¬† More pain for U.S. crude Should Trump win the Nov. 8 election, some investors said, it is not clear how the New York businessman could push through policies that clash with mainstream Republican party views on free trade and low taxes.  ‚ÄúThe investment community in particular is having trouble figuring out what (Trump) is about,‚Äù said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.  ‚ÄúThey are not taking individual items as seriously as they would with other candidates,‚Äù he said.  Traders said they will be watching Trump‚Äôs speech at the Republican convention on Thursday night for signs of how he would address business and tax issues, though they expect scant detail.  The Trump campaign did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment on how investment strategists viewed his policies.  U.S. stock indexes have rallied to new highs as Trump received the nomination of his party on a platform that includes a proposal to reinstate the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that would require a breakup of the largest U.S. banks.  A Trump presidency ‚Äúwould not be good for markets at all,‚Äù because of the uncertainty among investors about his true priorities, said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York.  Zemsky, however, said he has not so far been selling securities because of Trump. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to react to things that are said because of the lack of specificity, and the probability of him being elected is still low so changing your portfolio because of him is not likely to be profitable,‚Äù he said.  To be sure, Trump has supporters on Wall Street. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, has backed Trump and said he would be good for the economy because he would cut back on business-limiting regulations, such as those governing bank investments and labor policies. He also thinks Trump would bring in tax reform.  Although never elected to public office, Trump defeated 16 Republican rivals to win the nomination. He trails Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 7 percentage points, narrowing the gap from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.  If Trump‚Äôs stated proposals were carried out, that could leave the economy significantly weaker because they would result in large federal budget deficits and an anti-global stance that could hurt trade, according to a June analysis by Moody‚Äôs Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi.  Zandi forecast the loss of 3.5 million jobs during a Trump administration alongside a drop in stock prices and real estate value.  Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, build a wall between the United States and Mexico to stop illegal immigrants, and raise a 35 percent tariff on products made in Mexico by Ford and United Technologies Corp‚Äôs (UTX.N) Carrier Corp.  Yet there has been no selloff of Mexican stocks, which are up 10 percent so far in 2016. That is the best gauge of investment reaction to Trump, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.  ‚ÄúFor the most part,‚Äù Ablin said, ‚Äúthat suggests to me the investment community has not considered a Trump presidency a probable scenario at this point.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "
Obama: dark Trump vision 'doesn't really jibe' with facts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The dark vision of America under siege described by Donald Trump in his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination does not mesh with reality, U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday. Obama noted that the ‚Äúbirds were chirping and the sun was out‚Äù for most Americans after Trump‚Äôs Thursday night speech, which expounded on the threats to America from illegal immigrants, Islamic State militants, and race-related violence. ‚ÄúThis idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn‚Äôt really jibe with the experience of most people,‚Äù Obama said at a White House news conference after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Obama said the violent crime rate in America has been lower during his 7-1/2 years in office than any time during the last three or four decades, despite an ‚Äúuptick‚Äù in murders in some cities this year, and the recent high-profile killings of black men and police officers. The timing of Obama‚Äôs quickly arranged short meeting with Pena Nieto presented both leaders with a convenient platform from which to criticize Trump. Just three weeks ago, Obama - who has six months left in the White House - invited the Mexican president to visit one last time before the U.S. president leaves on Jan. 20. Trump has pledged to build a wall at the Mexico border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to force Mexico to pay for it. The New York businessman has also promised to slap tariffs on some U.S. products made in Mexico, and seek radical changes or even discard the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Pena Nieto was first to mention Trump, but said he respected both Trump and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and would work with constructively and in good faith with whoever wins the Nov. 8 election. In March, Pena Nieto likened Trump‚Äôs ‚Äústrident tone‚Äù to the ascent of dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. But he said on Friday that he had never pointed the finger at any of the candidates, saying that anything he had said had been taken out of context. And he stressed that the two nations‚Äô futures were closely bound. ‚ÄúThe closeness between the United States and Mexico is more than a relationship between governments. It‚Äôs a solid and unbreakable relationship between millions of people who live in both nations,‚Äù Pena Nieto said. Obama said the rate of illegal immigration is down from past decades, and praised Mexico for helping to address a flood of migrants fleeing Central America and for work on drug trafficking. ‚ÄúA Mexico that has a healthy economy, a Mexico that can help us build stability and security in Central America, that‚Äôs going to do a lot more to solve any migration crisis or drug trafficking problem than a wall,‚Äù Obama said. Obama and Pena Nieto praised the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal as addressing some of the criticisms of NAFTA. Both Trump and Clinton have said they oppose the TPP, which has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Congress. ‚ÄúThere are going to be different visions about where we should go as a country,‚Äù Obama said, running down a list of economic issues facing the nation. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre not going to make good decisions based on fears that don‚Äôt have a basis in fact,‚Äù he said.

Former Ku Klux Klan leader Duke runs for U.S. Senate in Louisiana,"BATON ROUGE, La.

Duke, a Republican, is a former Louisiana state legislator and unsuccessful candidate for governor who served a 15-month federal prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2002 to felony charges of tax evasion and mail fraud. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew criticism in February for failing to quickly disavow support from Duke. At a news conference in Baton Rouge after officially filing as a candidate to succeed outgoing Republican Senator David Vitter, Duke, 66, said he watched Trump‚Äôs speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday in Cleveland and heard echoes of his own past political platforms. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really care what Donald Trump says about me. I respect what he‚Äôs doing,‚Äù Duke said. In an online video announcing his candidacy, Duke also said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I‚Äôve championed for years.‚Äù In his video, Duke said he believes in equal rights and respect for all Americans but ‚Äúwhat makes me different is I also demand respect for the rights and heritage of European-Americans.‚Äù Duke‚Äôs announcement came as Louisiana‚Äôs capital grapples with racial tensions after the fatal July 5 shooting by police of a black man named Alton Sterling and the July 17 shooting deaths of three police officers by a black U.S. Marine Corps veteran. In his comments to reporters, Duke called the Black Lives Matter protest movement that arose after a series of killings of black men by police in various U.S. cities a ‚Äúterrorist group.‚Äù Duke said that ‚ÄúEuropean-Americans‚Äù need a politician to fight for their interests and that white people are threatened in the United States. Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, said he was no longer affiliated with the group. ‚ÄòHATE-FILLED FRAUD‚Äô Duke‚Äôs announcement drew and swift and scathing condemnation from Republican leaders and others. The Republican Party of Louisiana called Duke a ‚Äúfelon and hate-filled fraud‚Äù who does not embody Republican values. Ward Baker, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which supports Republican candidates in Senate races, said Duke will never get the organization‚Äôs backing. Louisiana does not hold party primaries. Instead, candidates from all parties are placed on the same ballot. If no one wins a simple majority in the Nov. 8 election, the top two vote-getters enter a runoff. Duke used this system to his advantage when he ran for governor in 1991 and made it to a runoff against former Governor Edwin Edwards, who had left office under a cloud of controversy for misconduct in office. Other candidates seeking to replace Vitter in the Senate include Republican U.S. congressmen Charles Boustany and John Fleming. Vitter did not seek re-election to the Senate after a prostitution scandal helped derail his bid to become Louisiana governor. ‚ÄúI strongly denounce the racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism of David Duke. His views are a relic of ancient history and are repugnant to Louisianians,‚Äù Boustany said.  A spokesman for Fleming said the congressman ‚Äúis wholly focused on uniting Louisiana voters of all races, creeds and religions.‚Äù  In February, Trump initially blamed his failure to reject Duke‚Äôs support on not having heard an interviewer clearly.  ‚ÄúI disavowed David Duke all weekend long, on¬†Facebook, on¬†Twitter, and obviously, it is never enough,‚Äù Trump told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show after being widely criticized.

"Trump accepts Republican nomination, vows to put 'America first'","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Donald Trump accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of a legacy of ‚Äúdeath, destruction, terrorism and weakness‚Äù as U.S. secretary of state and vowed to be tough on crime and illegal immigrants in a speech on Thursday accepting the Republican presidential nomination. Trump‚Äôs 75-minute speech was designed to set the tone for the general election campaign against Clinton, an answer to Republicans who say the best way he can unify the divided party is to detail why the Democrat should not be elected on Nov. 8. As the crowd chanted: ‚ÄúLock her up‚Äù for her handling of U.S. foreign policy, Trump waved them off and said: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs defeat her in November.‚Äù Thousands of supporters who were gathered in the convention hall roared their approval.  When it was over, Trump was joined on stage by family members as balloons cascaded from above and confetti blew around the arena. A CNN snap poll of viewers of the speech said 57 percent had a ‚Äúvery positive reaction‚Äù to the address and 18 percent a somewhat positive reaction, while 24 percent said it had a negative effect. Social media sentiment toward Trump based on tweets that mentioned his name was slightly more negative than positive shortly after his speech.  The acceptance speech by Trump, 70, closed out a four-day convention that underscored his struggle to heal fissures in the Republican Party over his anti-illegal-immigrant rhetoric and concerns about his temperament. The event was boycotted by many big-name establishment Republicans, such as 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and members of the Bush family that gave the party its last two presidents. Trump presented a bleak view of America under siege from illegal immigrants, threatened by Islamic State militants, hindered by crumbling infrastructure and weakened by unfair trade deals and race-related violence. Accusing illegal immigrants of taking jobs from American citizens and committing crimes, Trump vowed to build a ‚Äúgreat border wall‚Äù against the border-crossers. ‚ÄúWe will stop it,‚Äù Trump said. Trump took positions in conflict with traditional Republican policies. He said he would avoid multinational trade deals but instead pursue agreements with individual countries. He would renegotiate the NAFTA trade accord linking the United States, Canada and Mexico. He would penalize companies that outsource jobs and then export their foreign-made products back into the United States. ‚ÄúWe will never sign bad trade deals,‚Äù Trump thundered. ‚ÄúAmerica first!‚Äù The New York businessman, who has never held elected office, filled his speech with some of the bravado he used to win the Republican nomination over 16 rivals, punctuating his rhetorical points by waving an index finger. ‚ÄúI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúNobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.‚Äù In his speech, Trump portrayed himself as a fresh alternative to traditional politicians, willing to consider new approaches to vexing problems and help working-class people who may feel abandoned. Laying out his case against Clinton, he denounced nation-building policies that were actually put in place to some extent by George W. Bush, without mentioning by name the Republican president who launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump said policies pursued by Clinton in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria had made a bad situation worse. He blamed her for the rise of Islamic State militants and blasted her willingness to accept thousands of Syrian refugees. ‚ÄúAfter 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,‚Äù Trump said. Clinton senior adviser John Podesta dismissed the speech as painting ‚Äúa dark picture of an America in decline‚Äù and called it a reminder that Trump ‚Äúis temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States.‚Äù John Weaver, a senior adviser to Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich, a former presidential rival to Trump, said in a tweet that Trump had delivered the ‚Äúsaddest, darkest, most depressing acceptance speech in modern history.‚Äù  Trump needed a strong performance on Thursday night to improve his chances of getting a boost in opinion polls as Democrats prepare for their own, more scripted convention next week in Philadelphia. In a contest that pits two politicians viewed as unfavorable by large segments of the American people, Trump also accused Clinton, 68, of being the puppet of big business, elite media and major donors who want to preserve the current political system. ‚ÄúThat is why Hillary Clinton‚Äôs message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change ‚Äì and they have to change right now,‚Äù Trump said. Trump said he would speedily address the violence that has dominated headlines, such as the shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers earlier this month. He vowed to defeat ‚Äúthe barbarians of ISIS,‚Äù the acronym for Islamic State. ‚ÄúI have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on Jan. 20, 2017, safety will be restored,‚Äù Trump said. The next president takes office on Jan. 20. The prevailing narrative at the Cleveland convention has not been about Trump‚Äôs positions, but dominated instead by the failure of he party‚Äôs various factions to unite behind Trump. A series of distractions at the convention largely thwarted a bid by the Trump campaign to show him as a caring father and magnanimous business leader who would bring greater prosperity and safety to the United States.  But in the end, many of these points were made when Ivanka Trump, Trump‚Äôs daughter, introduced her father. ‚ÄúI have seen him fight for his family. I have seen him fight for his employees. I have seen him fight for his company and now I am seeing him fight for our country,‚Äù she said. Trump‚Äôs text of his speech, released by his campaign,  included extensive footnotes to show where the material originated. That was perhaps in reaction to the speech given on Monday night by Trump‚Äôs wife Melania, who was accused of plagiarism when she repeated lines from a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama, Obama‚Äôs wife. A staff writer for the Trump Organization later took responsibility for the misstep. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "

Undocumented immigrants given roles at Democratic convention,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Democratic Party has selected a handful of undocumented immigrants for official roles at next week‚Äôs Democratic National Convention, in a bid to highlight the gaping policy divide on immigration between White House hopeful Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton is hoping to drive Latino voters to the polls on Nov. 8 to shore up her chances against Trump, who has campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration by building a wall along the Mexican border and deporting millions of undocumented foreigners if elected. ‚ÄúOur nation is a nation of immigrants that believes in being inclusive, and that‚Äôs exactly what we will continue to work toward,‚Äù said¬†Leah Daughtry, the chief executive officer of the committee organizing the July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia. ‚ÄúThe voices of our nation‚Äôs brave undocumented youth will be heard loud and clear,‚Äù Daughtry added. The picks include two members of the convention credentials and platform committees, as well as several speakers. The positions are unpaid, officials said. Trump‚Äôs campaign, which has argued that unchecked immigration hurts American workers and undermines national security, criticized the move. ‚ÄúApparently speaking at Hillary Clinton‚Äôs convention is just one more job Hillary Clinton thinks Americans won‚Äôt do,‚Äù a Trump campaign aide said in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúShe should have instead invited unemployed Americans, or victims of crime, or law enforcement.‚Äù  The selections are legal because of a ‚Äúdeferred action program‚Äù adopted by President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration, which postpones deportations and provides work authorization for some immigrants brought to the United States as children. The Supreme Court blocked efforts to expand those protections last month. The nominations mark the first time a major U.S. political party‚Äôs convention has featured so many undocumented workers among its ranks. While there was an undocumented speaker at the 2012 Democratic convention, the party has not previously tracked the immigration status of its committee members. ‚ÄúIt changes the whole conversation when you have someone directly affected at the table,‚Äù said Cesar Vargas, a Mexican immigrant chosen for the party‚Äôs policy platform committee.  Hareth Andrade, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Bolivia who was approved under a deferred action program, was picked for the credentials committee.¬†The convention will also feature at least two undocumented immigrant speakers, Astrid Silva and Francisca Ortiz. Clinton already has overwhelming support from minorities. Some 70 percent back her, compared with 9 percent for Trump, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling, suggesting that she could have a strong chance in states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado that swing between voting Democratic and Republican in presidential elections.  However, voter turnout among Latinos has traditionally been low, hitting only about 40 percent in 2012, meaning her challenge is to get more of them to cast ballots this year. Luis Fraga, co-director of the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame, said showing a commitment to progressive reform of U.S. immigration policy could help Clinton do that.  He called immigration a gateway issue for minority voters that can help engage them. That‚Äôs especially so because even Latinos born in the United States are often not far removed from family members who are immigrants themselves.  ‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs not their individual experience, it is their family‚Äôs experience,‚Äù Fraga said.

A divided Republican party: Donald or Ivanka for president?," CLEVELAND/NEW YORK (Reuters) - At times, the speech was drowned out by the cheering crowds in the arena of the Republican National Convention. Social media crowned a new political star. Some Republicans said they were seeing the U.S. president they longed for.  It was Ivanka Trump‚Äôs night.  The eldest daughter of New York businessman-turned-presidential nominee Donald Trump almost stole the show on Thursday night with a speech about her father that roused a packed Cleveland convention hall, broadcast to millions.  READ OUR TOP STORIES:¬† Verizon emerges as front-runner in Yahoo auction OPINION - Dumb money:¬†How political mega-donors got it wrong Silicon Valley leads avalanche of quarterly reports On Google, there were more searches for Ivanka Trump than for her father.  The 34-year old businesswoman and former model talked about her father‚Äôs yearning to improve America, childcare, equal pay for women and other issues close to her heart, with a poise some found befitting of the White House.  ‚ÄúOkay, why isn‚Äôt @IvankaTrump running for President?‚Äù television actor Anson Mount said in a Twitter post.  ‚ÄúOne of the best speeches - if not the best speech - tonight,‚Äù said Chris Herrod, a 50-year-old delegate from Utah who had worked for Trump‚Äôs vanquished rival Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas.  One of Trump‚Äôs five children, Ivanka was chosen to introduce her father, who then officially accepted the Republican Party‚Äôs presidential nomination. Since Trump announced his intention to run for the White House last year, she has been steadily drawn into her father‚Äôs presidential campaign along with her 35-year-old husband Jared Kushner.  The couple both take part in the Trump campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúfamily meeting‚Äù each Monday morning, helping make decisions about spending and strategy, according to a source familiar with the meetings.  Among the children, Ivanka is the one who is often the bridge to women voters and seems to have the mission of selling her father‚Äôs softer side. When she is not involved in the campaign, she helps to run the family‚Äôs sprawling business empire from its New York City headquarters.  This week in Cleveland she has been everywhere, lobbying for her father with delegates and donors, appearing in television interviews and leaving a trail of picture-taking fans in her wake. One man, a Republican delegate in Cleveland, carried a placard all week around the convention that read: ‚ÄúIvanka, 2024. First Female President.‚Äù  Her star turn in Cleveland was one of the top trending topics on Twitter late on Thursday, with about 121 tweets mentioning her name posted every minute. Overall sentiment on her was more positive than negative by a ratio of 3 to 1, according to analytics firm Zoomph.  Ivanka missed her one chance to date to vote for her father: she had not changed her party registration from Democrat to Republican in time to cast a ballot in the April 19 New York primary election.  She more than compensated on Thursday night, some convention delegates said.  ‚ÄúShe gave us enormous insight into him and the kind of man he is,‚Äù said retiree Fernando C. deBaca, a 78-year-old New Mexico delegate. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs (an) enormously capable young lady, as is her brother.

"To wonks hungry for policy details, Trump team serves lighter fare","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - People seeking a deeper understanding of Donald Trump‚Äôs economic policy came up empty-handed this week at the Republican National Convention. Best known to Americans previously as a reality TV host and having never held public office, the New York businessman on Thursday accepted the party‚Äôs nomination for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The party establishment has fretted over some of his plans to curb illegal immigration, renegotiate trade deals and levy tariffs on China. Trump‚Äôs skepticism about free trade puts him at odds with Republican orthodoxy. Wall Street investors are wary and confused. In speeches from the main stage and in panel discussions on the sidelines, the four-day convention was notable for a paucity of policy details, the result perhaps of a desire to play down differences among the party faithful. The lack of specifics was too much for one head of a multinational corporation, who complained at a business forum that he had no idea what to expect from Trump, a New York real estate developer.  ‚ÄúWe feel anxious,‚Äù said Michael Thaman, chief executive officer of Owens Corning, which operates in 25 countries. ‚ÄúIn business, obviously details matter.‚Äù Trump offered little insight himself in his convention-ending acceptance speech. He spoke in broad, thematic strokes without much detail, sticking closely to positions he had outlined during 13 months of campaigning. ‚ÄúAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo,‚Äù Trump said. Speakers in Cleveland placed a greater emphasis on defeating the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, than on what Trump has called the failed economic policies of President Barack Obama. On Tuesday night, when the theme was ‚ÄúMake America Work Again‚Äù and the economy was the designated topic, a rough search by Reuters of the prime-time speeches found some 80 mentions of the word ‚ÄúClinton‚Äù compared to about 15 mentions of ‚Äúeconomy.‚Äù According to transcripts of the speeches delivered at the convention, only Trump‚Äôs son Donald Trump Jr. mentioned Dodd-Frank, the financial oversight law many Republicans rail against.  Asked on Thursday, before the older Trump‚Äôs speech, about the shortage of policy specifics, his campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said:  ‚ÄúThe campaign is pleased with the convention program, the content of which has been diverse and dynamic and we look forward to an exciting conclusion tonight.‚Äù Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was chief economic policy adviser to Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008, was not satisfied with his experience. He described taking part in a panel discussion on Wednesday with two Trump advisers, television commentator Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore of the conservative Heritage Foundation, that he said was light on details. ‚Äú‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt Mr. Trump bad on trade?‚Äô‚Äù he said someone would ask.  ‚Äú‚ÄòYes, but we‚Äôre going to fix it. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äô ‚Äú‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt his tax plan a problem that‚Äôs going to lose $12 trillion?‚Äô  ‚Äú‚ÄòYes, but we‚Äôll fix it. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äô‚Äù Kudlow and Moore also appeared on Tuesday at an event hosted by conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks, along with donor Andy Puzder, the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns fast-food restaurants Hardee‚Äôs and Carl‚Äôs Jr. The group discussed trade and immigration policy, with panelists at times shrugging off Trump‚Äôs lack of specifics. ‚ÄúAll you really need to know is the alternative is Hillary Clinton,‚Äù Puzder said at one point, reinforcing the week‚Äôs theme.  Republicans typically use their nominating conventions to emphasize their candidates‚Äô main policy points. Think tanks and lobby groups hold panel discussions. Experts circulate white papers.  With Trump, the events were built more around his personality and the need for the party to unite behind him.    There were some such gatherings in Cleveland, but fewer than usual, Holtz-Eakin said. Some advisers to past Republican candidates suspected Trump was not relying on a vast team of policy advisers.  Lanhee Chen, an adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, sorted through convention speeches in 2012 before speakers delivered them because, he said, he wanted to make sure they hewed closely to Romney‚Äôs positions. ‚ÄúI imagine the Trump campaign doesn‚Äôt have that process in place because they don‚Äôt have a lot of policy to talk about,‚Äù Chen said. ‚ÄúIt just says that policy hasn‚Äôt been a priority for them. You end up with a situation where the candidate is making pronouncements that don‚Äôt seem particularly well informed.‚Äù Some delegates who spoke to Reuters seemed unconcerned by the policy-light approach to the convention, arguing that it was more important for the gathering to whip up enthusiasm among the delegates and forge unity. ‚ÄúThis is more of a party,‚Äù said Ray Suttle, a 53-year-old lawyer and delegate from Virginia. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like people talking shop at a cocktail party, do you?‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 "
"Clinton faces pressure to pick VP who is tough on trade, Wall Street","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the Democratic Party‚Äôs liberal wing on Thursday nervously awaited Hillary Clinton‚Äôs announcement in coming days of a vice presidential running mate, urging her to choose someone who opposes a massive Pacific free trade deal and backs tough Wall Street reform. Two U.S. senators, Tim Kaine and Cory Booker, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack were among the contenders, according to a Democratic source with knowledge of the discussions. ‚ÄúAfter promising to oppose the TPP, it‚Äôs important for Clinton to pick someone who shares that position,‚Äù said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee The Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal, known as TPP, became a key issue during the primary season, with critics contending that it would be unfair to American workers. Clinton‚Äôs chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it. The Democratic source said that while Clinton‚Äôs decision was being closely held, there were ‚Äúvibes‚Äù she may be leaning toward Kaine as a partner to take on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence in the Nov. 8 election. But the source said that the consideration of Vilsack, a former governor of Iowa, ‚Äúis real,‚Äù even if Kaine, a senator from Virginia who is also a former governor of the state, might have an edge. Clinton ‚Äúwants somebody who will be a reliable partner she can trust and make the policy decisions‚Äù and potentially step into the presidency, the source said, adding that Clinton sees Kaine as someone who would ‚Äúfit that bill.‚Äù Hispanic-Americans, meanwhile, continued to push for a first-ever Latino on the Democratic ticket. ‚ÄúFor our members that kind of a message would certainly resonate,‚Äù said Yvanna Cancela, political director for the Culinary Workers Union in Las Vegas. ‚ÄúIt is way past the time for when we have a Latino in one of the highest offices in the country.‚Äù Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro had both been mentioned. Others have also come under consideration. The source added that U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the party‚Äôs liberal wing and a fierce critic of Wall Street, received close consideration by Clinton but would not provide the ‚Äúright balance‚Äù for the ticket. Others have also been under consideration in recent days, including Booker, to see if they hit a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù chord with Clinton, the source said. Booker, an African-American, is a first-term senator and a former mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Both Kaine and Vilsack have backed free-trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiation by the Obama administration, encompassing about 40 percent of the world‚Äôs economies stretching from Japan to Chile. Critics include Trump as well as Sanders. Clinton herself has distanced herself from the trade deal.  Taylor said that it is ‚Äúalso important she pick someone committed to strong Wall Street reform,‚Äù saying that the ‚Äúwrong pick‚Äù could hamper Democrats‚Äô drive to keep Trump from winning the White House. Booker traveled to Cleveland to defend the Clinton campaign, which has come under continued attack at the Republican convention there this week. ‚ÄúThe vile and the viciousness, it doesn‚Äôt reflect who we are as a country,‚Äù Booker said of the Republican convention, in an interviewed with MSNBC. Asked about his appearance Thursday on Clinton‚Äôs official Instagram account, Booker said it should not be read as tea leaves about a potential vice presidential pick.  ‚ÄúYou have a social media-minded person and I understand this platform,‚Äù he said.  The Democratic source knowledgeable about the process said Clinton could announce her running mate as early as Friday in Florida. She will campaign there in the run-up to next week‚Äôs Democratic convention in Philadelphia, where Clinton is expected to be formally nominated. Another Democratic source said Clinton might wait until Saturday to help keep the media focused on the Republican convention in Cleveland, where opposing wings of that party were in open warfare.  Television interviewer Charlie Rose, speaking with Clinton recently, noted that some view Kaine as ‚Äúboring.‚Äù Clinton responded, ‚ÄúI love that about him.‚Äù Susie Tompkins Buell, a founder of the Esprit fashion label and close friend of Clinton, on Thursday would not comment on who might be the choice. But Buell, a major donor to Clinton‚Äôs campaign, said the person would be a ‚Äúhigh contrast‚Äù to Trump‚Äôs choice of Pence. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "
Trump NATO plan would be sharp break with decades-long U.S. policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican foreign policy veterans and outside experts warned that the suggestion by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that he might abandon NATO‚Äôs pledge to automatically defend all alliance members could destroy an organization that has helped keep the peace for 66 years and could invite Russian aggression. ‚ÄúStatements like these make the world more dangerous and the United States less safe,‚Äù Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump critic who is one of the Republican Party‚Äôs leading foreign policy voices and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. ‚ÄúI can only imagine how our allies in NATO, particularly the Baltic states, must feel after reading these comments from Mr. Trump. I‚Äôm 100 percent certain how Russian President Putin feels ‚Äì he‚Äôs a very happy man,‚Äù he said.Trump‚Äôs comments in a New York Times interview ‚Äúwould seem to put him on the same page with Mr. Putin,‚Äù Richard Armitage, who was deputy secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration, said in an interview with Reuters. In the New York Times interview, Trump, in response to a question about potential Russian aggression toward the Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - said that if Moscow attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing whether those nations ‚Äúhave fulfilled their obligations to us.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIf they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the end of NATO,‚Äù Robert Hunter, a former U.S. ambassador to the alliance under President Bill Clinton, told Reuters. ‚ÄúThe essence of NATO, more than any other single factor, is the commitment of the United States of America to the security of the other 27 members.‚Äù Asked about Trump‚Äôs comments, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the EU knows it needs to ‚Äúwork more on our defense capabilities,‚Äù but said the United States needs to keep solidarity with its allies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very simple to realize that in the world of today, which is quite a complicated one and quite a dangerous one, you need friends,‚Äù said Mogherini, who spoke in Washington at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. A letter signed by a bipartisan group of 39 national security experts said Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúinflammatory remarks‚Äù do not represent the interests of the United States. ‚ÄúThe strength of our alliances is at the core of those interests,‚Äù said the group, which includes prominent Republicans such as former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and former State Department official Eliot Cohen. The United States must uphold the North Atlantic Treaty Organization‚Äôs commitments ‚Äúto all of our allies, including Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,‚Äù the letter said. U.S. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the mutual defense commitment was the essence of the Atlantic alliance. But he added that both Republicans and Democrats ‚Äúare becoming exasperated that most members of the alliance are not honoring their obligations‚Äù for military spending, Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said in a statement. Responding to Trump‚Äôs suggestion that his decisions would depend in part on whether states that were attacked were meeting their financial commitments to the alliance, former diplomat Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said it is important not to see NATO or any alliance solely in budget terms. ‚ÄúMore important is the net benefit the U.S. derives from the stability and security of the country and region affected and the price the U.S. would pay if stability were to be lost or its interests undermined,‚Äù Haass told Reuters. Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO in 1949 and calls an attack on one member an attack on all, has been invoked once - to help defend the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Following the attacks, NATO sent AWACS planes to patrol over U.S. skies, with more than 800 crew members from 13 NATO countries flying over 360 sorties. As part of the eight measures approved to support the United States, NATO, about three weeks later, sent elements of its Standing Naval Forces to patrol the Eastern Mediterranean and monitor shipping, expanding that to include the entire Mediterranean several months later. A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also noted that the alliance ‚Äúdeployed a third of the troops in Afghanistan for over a decade, where over one thousand soldiers from non-U.S. NATO allies and partners gave their lives.‚Äù Still, some experts downplayed Trump‚Äôs comments, even as they criticized them. Kurt Volker, who was U.S. ambassador to NATO under both Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama, said it was inadvisable to create doubts in adversaries‚Äô minds about the consequences they would face if they invaded a country. ‚ÄúPutin loves it,‚Äù Volker said. But he said the general European attitude was to take Trump‚Äôs pronouncements with a grain of salt. ‚ÄúEveryone knows it‚Äôs an election campaign,‚Äù he said. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "

"As Republicans anoint Trump, party grapples with identity crisis","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - On the floor and corridors of the basketball arena hosting the Republican National Convention, in restaurants and bars, hotel lobbies and conference rooms across Cleveland, the talk was of the rise of Donald Trump, whose unlikely presidential candidacy has caused seismic fractures in the Republican Party. While the venues changed, the question didn‚Äôt: Where do we go from here? This was the week that Trump was officially nominated as the Republicans‚Äô 2016 presidential candidate and was effectively given control of a party whose leaders have criticized him for his incendiary rhetoric, personal attacks on fellow Republicans, and tendency to stray from decades-old party orthodoxy.  He packed the convention hall with his grassroots army of supporters, who seemed almost completely disinterested in his policy positions, even though they could reshape the party for years to come on core issues like trade, immigration and foreign policy. Those who were interested - party veterans, lawmakers, donors and lobbyists - found little clarity in any of the speeches delivered from the convention stage or in conversations with members of the Trump campaign. Are we still a party that embraces free trade and free markets, they asked. Are we still committed to ending abortion rights? Do we want to create a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants or ship all of them out of the country? Paul Ryan, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and the most powerful elected Republican, acknowledged that Trump has transformed his party. But he hedged on whether he believes Trump‚Äôs impact will be lasting or simply a temporary phenomenon that will dissipate if he loses on Nov. 8.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the answer to that question. I really have no idea,‚Äù Ryan said at an event in Cleveland. Trump had changed the party, he said, but ‚Äúhow specifically and in what direction, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  Even after two days of speeches, Utah delegate Matt Throckmorton was still trying to figure out what a Trump presidency would mean for the Republican Party. ‚ÄúWhat happens next?‚Äù asked Throckmorton. In many way the uncertainty about Trump reflects the conflict within the Republican electorate. The party has struggled to find consensus on a number of key issues, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling during the 2016 campaign season. For example, when asked in March about international trade, the same number of Republicans said it ‚Äúcreates jobs‚Äù as said it ‚Äúcauses job losses.‚Äù When asked about abortion in June, the number of Republicans who wanted it to be illegal ‚Äúin all cases‚Äù was matched by those who wanted it to be legal ‚Äúin most cases.‚Äù  Trump had his biggest stage on Thursday night, when he officially accepted the party‚Äôs nomination, to spell out his vision of where he would take the Republican Party if he won the presidency. But his speech, rich in rhetoric, offered scant detail beyond sweeping promises to put ‚ÄúAmerica first.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf this Trump speech - and this GOP platform -  defines what a Republican is today, then it‚Äôs hard to say I‚Äôm one. Hard for a lot of us,‚Äù tweeted Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman under President George W Bush.  A week earlier, Republican activists were celebrating the adoption of a deeply conservative political platform that condemned gay marriage and opposed abortion with no exceptions, among other things. Trump‚Äôs lineup of speakers at the convention this week barely referenced it.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little bit frightening,‚Äù said Chris Herrod, another Utah delegate, explaining that the platform was one of the main ways delegates could help shape party policy. ‚ÄúAnd he seems to have an attitude of just completely disregarding it.‚Äù  Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump was ‚Äúthe future of the Republican Party.‚Äù Away from the floor, some anti-Trump Republicans were quietly debating whether it would be better in the long-term interests of the party to lose the White House in November. ‚ÄúThis week we‚Äôre having some real anguished discussions,‚Äù said Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota. ‚ÄúPeople are falling in line‚Äù with Trump, Weber said, ‚Äúbut what does this party believe?‚Äù Take trade, for example. Republicans have long been the party of free trade, but Trump has said current trade deals have impoverished American workers and wants to renegotiate them or in some cases block them altogether, like President Barack Obama‚Äôs signature Trans-Pacific Partnership. Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and a close Trump ally, worked to ease fears that a Trump administration would derail the U.S. economy by scrapping trade alliances. ‚ÄúHe has no interest in breaking up the world market,‚Äù Gingrich told a group of diplomats, adding that Trump was, in fact, committed to free trade with some added protections for American companies.  ‚ÄúNow how Trump will work this out, I have no idea,‚Äù Gingrich added. Some attendees at the convention expressed the hope that Trump would align himself with many of their cherished conservative values but admitted they just didn‚Äôt know what he would do once he was in office. They would have found little solace in Gingrich‚Äôs remarks to the diplomats. ‚ÄúYou will not know what he‚Äôs doing every morning, because he will not know what he‚Äôs doing every morning,‚Äù Gingrich told them, suggesting a Trump presidency would be similar to his candidacy - reactive, spontaneous and centered almost entirely around Trump‚Äôs instincts. But Trump‚Äôs instincts are sometimes at odds with key elements of the party. For example, he has been more accepting of gay rights and has see-sawed on abortion rights, first defending them and then saying he opposes abortion.  ‚ÄúConservatives are prepared to believe Trump might be wrong 20, 25, maybe 30 percent of the time,‚Äù Richard Viguerie, a veteran Republican activist, told Reuters at an anti-abortion event. But, Trump‚Äôs opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, ‚Äúwill be wrong 100 percent of the time.‚Äù Asked if Trump supported the conservative social values espoused in the platform, he laughed. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to wait and see.‚Äù Some lawmakers at the convention dismissed some of Trump‚Äôs most provocative proposals, like his vow to deport an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, as unlikely to be implemented.  ‚ÄúFull-blown deportation is not going to sell politically and I don‚Äôt think a Republican Congress, or any Congress, would stand by and watch it happen,‚Äù Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma told a group of convention attendees.   Some Republicans believe should Trump lose, the party will simply return to its more traditional conservative principles.  ‚ÄúThe Republican Party is bigger than any one candidate, even a presidential candidate,‚Äù said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. But Trump supporters said those Republicans were in denial and that Trump had permanently wrested control of the party away from the establishment elites.  ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mitt Romney, where are the Bushes?‚Äù said Mary Lou McCoy, who had traveled to Cleveland from Buffalo, New York, referring to the 2012 Republican nominee and the Bush political dynasty. ‚ÄúThe people have spoken.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 "
"Glitzy parties, bowling: Scenes from the other Republican convention","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Bourbon¬†flowed, a jazz band played, and pink and violet lights bathed the vaulted stone ceilings at a party thrown by a liquor producers‚Äô lobby group on Monday¬†for attendees of the Republican National Convention. Seven blocks away in Cleveland, in the arena where Donald Trump was to officially accept his party‚Äôs nod for the White House, a fight boiled over between Trump supporters and foes about the rules concerning his nomination. Delegates shouted at each other. The chairman tasked with keeping order briefly abandoned the podium. Microphones went dead. Typically, the Republican convention that takes place every four years is a tale of two conventions. At the official one, activists from all 50 states come to hear testimonials about their party‚Äôs presidential nominee and watch the candidate‚Äôs official coronation. At the other, Republicans in the professional class - strategists, lobbyists, pollsters, lawmakers - rub elbows at cocktail hours and concerts, woo donors at power breakfasts and toss back booze at night, all the while conducting informal business, swapping pledges of support and plans for the future. This year, the disconnect between the two conventions seemed more pronounced, several lobbyists and activists said, and some parties were more subdued. The Distilled Spirits Council‚Äôs soiree, normally a jam-packed affair, drew a more modest crowd this year, according to some Republicans who have attended it at past conventions. The council‚Äôs senior vice president, Frank Coleman, pooh-poohed the idea that attendance was down. ‚ÄúIt was a very large venue,‚Äù he said, saying that the party still attracted about 700 people over the course of the evening. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said there was a muted tone at some Cleveland gatherings, which he attributed to the unique relationship between Trump and his party‚Äôs establishment. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate and a former Massachusetts governor, and Senator John McCain, the party‚Äôs 2008 nominee, hailed from the establishment and had extensive ties with businesspeople and strategists who are convention regulars. By contrast, Trump, a real estate developer and former reality TV star who has never held elective office, clinched the Republican nomination by touting his outsider status.¬† ‚ÄúYou have a non-politician, a Hollywood entertainer trying to show Americans he‚Äôs fit for office, and you have Republicans who are used to coming to these things for years,‚Äù Bonjean said. The two groups, he said, weren‚Äôt mixing so smoothly. Inside the convention arena on Thursday evening, Trump fans cheered, danced to a band and roared support for a succession of speakers as they awaited the event‚Äôs finale - Trump‚Äôs speech formally accepting the nomination.¬†But in bars and parties nearby, there was hardly any clapping and cheering as those same scenes flashed across televisions. Some Republicans flew in to Cleveland for only for a day or two, to host events for lawmakers and clients, then left before Trump‚Äôs¬†Thursday¬†night speech. One lobbyist for a large industrial conglomerate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had a mission in Cleveland that had little to do with Trump: mingling with congressional Republicans and showing support for their re-election efforts. The informal convention did still take place, although more subdued. One strategist skipped a night of speeches and pageantry to gamble at a nearby casino. He won $8,000. A group of three made quick glances at a TV screen as Trump‚Äôs wife, Melania, spoke on Monday night, checking on her progress between turns at a bar with bowling lanes that had been converted to a private lounge. But there were constant reminders that Cleveland was different. As an outsider, Trump lacks the kind of donor network that is typical of major party candidates and only recently has begun to ramp up his fundraising. Before the convention started, companies that habitually donate to the RNC withheld pledges or withdrew them, leading organizers to ask casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, a generous party benefactor, for an urgent donation. A strategist who asked for help to raise a last-minute $15,000 to sponsor food and drinks at a country music concert for delegates could not find any corporate donors willing to pony up. Eight of the 12 people he contacted said they were skipping the convention entirely. On Tuesday, Trump passed up a chance to forge closer ties with more big donors when he failed to appear¬†at a breakfast  held on the field of the new football stadium in town, according to a report in Time magazine. Later that day, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie met with donors to brief them on plans for a team that would ease Trump into office if he wins the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Such gatherings often attract billionaires and other moneyed luminaries. A man in charge of fundraising surveyed attendees in the modestly sized conference room and declared, ‚ÄúI think I see about $600,000 in here.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 "
"They held a convention in Cleveland, and (so far) few protesters came","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Kirtland Park, on the shores of Lake Erie near downtown Cleveland, was designated as a place where hundreds of protesters could camp during the Republican National Convention. It is less than a quarter full. One measure of the shortfall: With about 10 transportable toilets on hand Tuesday night and about 15 tents, the city was providing one plastic commode for every two campers.  U.S. political conventions typically are protest magnets, and the Republican National Convention that nominated Donald Trump as its presidential candidate after a bitter primary campaign had been seen as a major draw. But three days in, the crowds were far smaller than expected.  Activists said deadly attacks on police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Dallas had scared off some would-be protesters. Others saw the presence of ‚Äúopen carry‚Äù gun-rights advocates as a threat to their safety. Cleveland‚Äôs heavy police presence discouraged others, protest leaders said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely disappointed with turnout,‚Äù said Lee Garnett, a 39-year-old tech worker who came from San Francisco to protest Trump‚Äôs nomination. As he stood in Kirtland Park on Tuesday night, about two dozen activists listened to a man strum a guitar and sing. Garnett said friends had backed out. ‚ÄúIt was fear of violence. Fear of violence from the police and fear of violence from the Trump supporters,‚Äù he said, citing Trump‚Äôs prediction in March of riots if he were denied the nomination.  City records show three of five officially permitted protests planned for the first three days of the convention did not occur. Either organizers canceled events or supporters failed to take part, city officials said.  The American Civil Liberties Union had won a court battle to reduce the size of the security area around the convention hall, arguing that people needed more space to exercise their free speech rights. But the designated 1.7-square-mile (440-hectare) ‚Äúevent zone‚Äù easily accommodated the few hundred protesters on hand at any given time. At rallies, police officers appeared swiftly and often outnumbered the protesters. On Wednesday, police arrested 18 people - the biggest number of the convention so far - after they scuffled with police while trying to set fire to an American flag near the convention entrance. Cleveland has put 500 police officers on the streets, backed by about 3,000 reinforcements from as far away as California and Texas. Hundreds of cops on bicycles, with others on foot and horseback, have directed and controlled crowds.  ‚ÄúIt has a chilling effect on the exercise of free speech, which is so critical in a democratic society,‚Äù said Terry Gilbert, a veteran Cleveland civil rights lawyer. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs dangerous. I think that could change the whole dynamic of protest.‚Äù Cleveland police say the events have gone smoothly so far, with little violence and only 23 convention-related arrests through Wednesday. Cleveland activist Art McCoy, founder of civil rights group Black Man‚Äôs Army, which often protests against police use of force, said his group is not marching. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided to be still and observe,‚Äù McCoy said, adding that he doubted convention protests would change relations between minorities and local police. ‚ÄúThe convention is just a distraction.‚Äù Local activist Rachelle Smith said the Dallas shooting, in which five people were killed, influenced her choice to act as a legal observer and adviser rather than leading protests. ‚ÄúI expected numbers to be bigger ‚Äì whether from people coming in from out of town or people from Cleveland getting involved,‚Äù she said. But Christine Link, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said Clevelanders have little experience assembling large-scale protests.  ‚ÄúCleveland is not Chicago or New York,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the activist networks, we don‚Äôt have the populations of those cities.‚Äù Ann Wright, 70, a member of the antiwar group Code Pink who  traveled from Honolulu, said the same fear that caused some to stay home prompted her to travel to Cleveland.  ‚ÄúPeople who have privilege - I‚Äôm a white woman, I‚Äôm a retired lieutenant colonel - have to do this because we can,‚Äù said Wright, a former U.S. Army officer and former U.S. diplomat. Protest organizers were not giving up. On Wednesday, a group of immigrant-rights activists donned ponchos with a brick pattern and stood shoulder to shoulder in what they called a human wall. Trump has promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a beautiful sight,‚Äù Ivan Vargas, a 28-year-old business consultant from Atlanta, said as the march kicked off. ‚ÄúThese are people who are ready to put their bodies on the line.‚Äù  At the end of the event, piles of unworn ponchos remained on the ground.

Pentagon revises law of war manual after criticism of press treatment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Friday updated its law of war manual after a previous version came under fire for appearing to allow commanders to treat journalists as belligerents or spies. The U.S. Department of Defense manual, the first and most comprehensive of its kind, was first released last June. It compared some of the tasks of journalism to spying or other hostile actions by an enemy. The manual said some journalists may be considered ‚Äúunprivileged belligerents‚Äù ‚Äî a legal category with fewer protections than combatants, such as prisoner-of-war status. ‚ÄúReporting on military operations can be very similar to collecting intelligence or even spying,‚Äù one passage of the manual said. Press freedom advocates said the manual‚Äôs wording blurred the line between journalists and combatants and gave commanders the authority to detain reporters without charge. They also warned that it would erode U.S. credibility abroad at a time when journalists are being targeted by governments and militant groups. Sixty-nine journalists were killed for their work in 2015, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, up from 61 in 2014. In 2015, 199 journalists were being detained worldwide, compared to 221 in 2014. After the manual‚Äôs release last year, news organizations including Reuters met with Pentagon officials to protest the language and ask for changes.  The revised manual provides greater detail on the legitimate purposes that journalists serve and makes clear that journalists have all the rights of civilians. Press freedom groups, including CPJ and Reporters Without Borders, praised the revisions. Advocates said the new manual acknowledged journalists‚Äô right to interview enemy combatants and placed the onus on commanders to discern between the actions of reporters and combatants. ‚ÄúThese are major changes,‚Äù said Frank Smyth of the CPJ. ‚ÄúThis affirms the rights and the practice of open and independent reporting on the battlefield.‚Äù The Pentagon eliminated the passages comparing reporting to spying or hostile acts, but gives specific examples of how an act of reporting could result in the loss of civilian status. Journalists could still be considered unprivileged belligerents, the manual states, if they were a member of a non-state armed group and were carrying out propaganda ‚Äúor other media activities.‚Äù Journalists could also lose their civilian status in certain cases, such as relaying target coordinates for an artillery strike against opposing forces, the manual said.  The new manual also eliminates language that called for journalists to seek permission from ‚Äúrelevant authorities‚Äù for their work ‚Äúto avoid being mistaken for spies.‚Äù That passage drew criticism for setting an unrealistic standard for war reporting, in which frontlines can shift quickly. To cover conflicts in Libya or Syria, for instance, reporters often have to cross borders illegally. Pentagon officials also said they would be willing to revise the manual again if needed. ‚ÄúThe department‚Äôs mission is to defend the very freedoms that journalists exercise,‚Äù the Pentagon‚Äôs top lawyer, Jennifer O‚ÄôConnor, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe have learned a lot during this process, and the department and the manual are better off for the experience.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 "
Peter Thiel tells Republican convention he is 'proud to be gay',"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, the only big-name supporter of Donald Trump from the country‚Äôs technology hub, spoke on Thursday at the Republican National Convention to urge the country to discard petty cultural battles and turn its attention to solving the United States‚Äô economic decline. Thiel offered a full-throated endorsement of Trump, echoing the Republican candidate‚Äôs themes of economic decline while  lambasting economic and foreign policies that have allowed the country to get embroiled in ‚Äústupid wars.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur nuclear bases still use floppy disks. Our newest fighter jets can‚Äôt even fly in the rain,‚Äù Thiel said on the final evening of the four-day convention in Cleveland. ‚ÄúInstead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East.‚Äù A co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook Inc  who sits on that company‚Äôs board of directors, Thiel is well-known for contrarian and even eccentric views: a Libertarian who supports gay rights and legalizing marijuana, and who has proposed floating cities beyond the government‚Äôs reach while encouraging students to drop out of college and start companies. His support of Trump has been both a source of curiosity and the butt of jokes in Silicon Valley, where Trump‚Äôs anti-immigrant, anti-trade positions are regarded with horror. Many tech executives lean Democratic, and prominent Republican tech executives such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman have also rejected Trump. Thiel, who is gay, was expected to address gay rights in front of a political party whose platform rejects gay marriage and gay rights in general. He stopped short of such an appeal, however, addressing his sexuality only when saying: ‚ÄúI am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American.‚Äù He is only the second openly gay man to address the Republican National Convention, CNN reported. ‚ÄúWhen I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union, and we won,‚Äù Thiel said. ‚ÄúNow we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?‚Äù Thiel said his support for Trump was based on the belief that the candidate could address the country‚Äôs economic decline. He cited the space program and other government technology achievements as examples of what has been lost. Thiel drew parallels between himself and Trump each as a ‚Äúbuilder.‚Äù His family emigrated from Germany when Thiel was one year old, and arrived in Cleveland - the city hosting this week‚Äôs convention. When Thiel pointed that out, he got loud applause. Back then, Thiel said, ‚ÄúOpportunity was everywhere.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn 1968, the world‚Äôs high-tech capital wasn‚Äôt just one city.

White House calls for Malaysian transparency in wake of fund scandal,"WASHINGTON/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The White House urged Malaysia on Thursday to demonstrate good governance and a transparent business climate, a day after U.S. prosecutors sued to try and seize $1 billion in assets they said were bought with money stolen from a state development fund. The civil lawsuits present a potentially thorny issue for the two countries that have grown closer during the administration of President Barack Obama, who has visited the southeast Asian nation twice in the last two years. The lawsuits will likely affect relations, but they did not come as a surprise, said a U.S. congressional aide. ‚ÄúIt has been a concern of a lot of people for a long time. Corruption in Malaysia is a huge problem,‚Äù the aide said. No criminal charges have been filed in the scandal surrounding Malaysia‚Äôs 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, which was overseen by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Obama spoke generally with Najib on a visit to Malaysia last year about the need for transparency and good governance, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing. ‚ÄúFor business interests who are considering doing business in Malaysia, they‚Äôre going to be looking for signs that there is good business climate,‚Äù Earnest told reporters. The Malaysian government ‚Äúshould be conspicuous about making clear that they‚Äôre committed to transparency and good governance, and the kind of rules that will encourage people who are considering investing in Malaysia‚Äôs fast-growing economy to have confidence that they can do so fairly,‚Äù Earnest said. Najib said in response to the lawsuits that his government would give its full cooperation to international investigations of the 1MDB case. Malaysia‚Äôs foreign minister Anifah Aman met the U.S. Ambassador to Malaysia Joseph Yun on Thursday to discuss the lawsuits. ‚ÄúMalaysia highly values its bilateral relations with the United States and calls on the U.S. to recognize the various steps taken by the Government of Malaysia to address the 1MDB issue,‚Äù the ministry said in a statement on Thursday night. Malaysia‚Äôs Attorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali, however, expressed ‚Äústrong concerns at the insinuations and allegations‚Äù of wrongdoing against Najib in the lawsuits.  He said in a statement that none of the probes conducted by law enforcement agencies across the globe over the past year show that any funds were misappropriated from 1MDB. The U.S. investigation is the largest set of cases brought by the Justice Department‚Äôs Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, which seeks the forfeiture of the proceeds of foreign corruption. Targeting assets ranging from valuable paintings and a private jet to the 2013 hit movie ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù and rights to popular songs, the civil lawsuits said $3.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB. 1MDB said in a statement that it was not a party to the lawsuit, did not have any assets in the United States, ‚Äúnor has it benefited from the various transactions described.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "
"Trump warns he could end NATO guarantee, scrap NAFTA","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he might abandon NATO‚Äôs guarantee of mutual defense and would renegotiate or scrap the NAFTA trade deal if he is elected, drawing fire from some senior Republicans and his Democratic rival. In response to a question about potential Russian aggression against the Baltic states, Trump told the New York Times that  Washington would help defend other NATO members only if they had ‚Äúfulfilled their obligations to us.‚Äù  All three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are former Soviet republics and now NATO members. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort did not dispute the quotes, saying they were consistent with the candidate‚Äôs desire to modernize the United States‚Äô international treaties.  But national security officials and some Republicans said abandoning NATO‚Äôs mutual defense guarantee, enshrined in  Article 5 of the treaty, would abandon 66 years of U.S. foreign policy and threaten the world‚Äôs most powerful military alliance. Also weighing in was the campaign for Democrat Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Trump‚Äôs likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúTrump has apparently decided that America lacks the moral authority to advance our interests and values around the world,‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs senior foreign policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a statement.      Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN he disagreed ‚Äútotally‚Äù with Trump‚Äôs comments on NATO. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most important military alliance in world history. It remains relevant today. Many Americans don‚Äôt know that the operation in Afghanistan is a NATO operation,‚Äù McConnell said, adding: ‚ÄúI want to reassure our NATO allies that we will come to the defense of any member that is threatened.‚Äù U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a former presidential rival of Trump, said Trump‚Äôs remarks made the world more dangerous and the United States less safe. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday he would not interfere in the U.S. election campaign but that allied solidarity was a key value for the group. ‚ÄúThis is good for European security and good for U.S. security,‚Äù the NATO head said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe United States has always stood by its European allies.‚Äù Trump previously said he would force allies to shoulder more of the defense costs that the United States has borne for decades, cancel long-standing treaties he considers unfavorable, and redefine what it means to be a partner of the United States.Stoltenberg said defense spending among European allies and Canada rose last year for the first time in many years. In 2016, he said, he expected a further 3 percent increase, or $8 billion. TRADE DISPUTESTrump has railed against the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico as a U.S. job killer and was quoted as saying in the New York Times interview that he would be prepared to scrap it if he could not negotiate much better terms for the United States. The North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994 during the administration of President Bill Clinton, the husband of Hillary Clinton. Unlike the NATO treaty, U.S. laws appear to give presidents  significant authority to renegotiate foreign trade deals without consulting Congress, trade experts said. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúTrump as president would have an enormous amount of discretion,‚Äù said Barry Bosworth, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former White House staffer. ¬†¬†¬† If elected, Trump could unilaterally terminate NAFTA or any other free trade deal, although a court would likely have to decide if the president had that authority, said Gary Hufbauer, a former deputy assistant secretary for trade at the Treasury Department. ¬†¬†¬†NAFTA was enacted by a law passed by Congress, but Article 2205 of the agreement allows any party to withdraw from the deal with six months‚Äô notice, and Hufbauer said U.S. courts would likely allow Trump to make that decision.  ¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThe president has a lot more power than is generally recognized,‚Äù said Hufbauer, currently at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.¬†¬†¬†  ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "
"U.S. may take movie, music roles in Malaysia fund asset seizure","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government may become a movie and music industry player, at least temporarily, after moving to seize $1 billion in assets that prosecutors said were bought with money looted from the Malaysian state development fund.  The 2013 movie ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù and an interest in the rights of EMI Music Publishing are among the targets of civil lawsuits that are filled with allegations that Malaysian officials, their relatives and associates laundered the fund‚Äôs money and hid it in property, artwork and luxury goods in the United States. Seizures of assets by government authorities are fairly common, but they more typically involve sports cars, yachts and jewelry bought with drug trafficking proceeds or with profits from white-collar crime. The case of the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB announced on Wednesday is unusually large and involves some out-of-the-ordinary assets, such as rights associated with the dark comedy film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a corrupt New York stockbroker. The film could make another $100 million in the near future, a box office analyst said. According to the lawsuits, a Malaysian national involved in creating 1MDB, Low Taek Jho, used about $10 million from 1MDB to invest in the film and separately used about $107 million to buy ‚Äúa substantial interest‚Äù in EMI, the world‚Äôs third-largest music publishing company by revenue.  Low did not respond to requests for comment sent to his Hong Kong-based company, Jynwel Capital. U.S. government-seized assets are usually sold off at auction to raise money for victims. Until that can happen, U.S. authorities must maintain the assets, officials said. The U.S. Marshals Service manages and auctions seized assets. If a judge approves the seizure of 1MDB-linked assets, the usual process would be followed, Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said. The assets would be initially restrained so their owners could not sell or transfer them. Any profits generated would be held in escrow until the case was resolved, Carr said. ‚ÄúWe would sell those interests and, if possible and appropriate, use the proceeds of those sales for the benefit of the victim citizens in Malaysia,‚Äù Carr said in an email.  In the 1990s, the government owned shares in a California casino and through a trustee helped to manage it, putting Washington for a short time in the gambling business. A Marshals Service spokeswoman said she did not immediately know if the agency had previously auctioned film and music royalty rights. The agency had 17,564 assets on hand as of September 2015, valued at $3.1 billion, its website said. Court papers filed by the Justice Department would, if approved by a judge, grant sweeping powers to the Marshals Service to manage the 1MDB-linked assets. Under a proposed restraining order, Red Granite Pictures, which produced ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street,‚Äù would have to maintain present contracts related to the film and ‚Äúallow the United States to join in and direct key business decisions about day to day operations.‚Äù In a statement, Red Granite said that to its knowledge, none of the money it received was illegitimate and that co-founder Riza Aziz and the company did nothing wrong. Aziz is the stepson of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who oversaw the 1MDB fund. The Justice Department lawsuits said that high-level officials of 1MDB corruptly diverted more than $3.5 billion from the fund over six years. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "
"""Make Republicans Whole Again!"" A divided party struggles to rally behind Trump","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Ted Cruz was recounting to an audience how he had outlasted most of his 16 rivals for the Republican presidential nomination when a plane carrying the man who had won it all, Donald Trump, flew overhead, interrupting him mid-speech. ‚ÄúAll right, that was pretty well-orchestrated,‚Äù said Cruz, a Republican U.S. senator from Texas who waged a bitter campaign against Trump. Hours later Cruz would take his revenge, refusing to endorse Trump and urging Republicans to vote their conscience during a prime-time speech on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He left the podium to a chorus of boos, and his wife was escorted off the floor as the convention erupted in rancor. Susan Hutchison, chair of the Washington state delegation, said she confronted Cruz after his speech and called him a ‚Äútraitor to the party.‚Äù So much for party unity. Over three days in Cleveland this week, Republican leaders sought to sell a story of unity. They repeatedly said the party was getting ever closer to rallying behind Trump, who is running on the slogan ‚ÄúMake America Great Again!‚Äù and whose candidacy has divided many and exposed deep discontent among  Republicans with their leaders.  But in a few minutes on Wednesday night that show of unity was blown apart in spectacular fashion. Cruz‚Äôs non-committal speech infuriated Trump supporters among the thousands of delegates cramming the floor of the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. But their angry jeers triggered recriminations from other delegates.   ‚ÄúThey talk about unity and then they act like that. That is not going to get us to unify,‚Äù said Manette Merrill, a Cruz delegate from Washington state.  Trump will get the opportunity to rally the party when he formally accepts its nomination on Thursday night in a speech expected to be watched by millions of Americans, including undecided and independent voters. One of Trump‚Äôs key goals going into this week‚Äôs convention was to unite the party after a roughly 18-month primary season that was marked by personal attacks on candidates, sometimes violent rallies, and deep disagreement over what it means to be a Republican. In public and in private the Trump campaign tried to win over skeptics who feel the New York businessman and celebrity TV star does not represent the party‚Äôs values. It took a harder stance against opponents, for example shutting down a desperate last-minute bid on the convention floor early in the week to stop his nomination.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a slow crawl,‚Äù former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said of the unity drive as he made the rounds at the convention. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kind of doing it. You‚Äôre kind of looking around to see if anyone else is doing it,‚Äù he told Reuters.  But almost from the start there were blatant signs of party disunity.  Ohio Governor John Kasich, who lost to Trump in the nomination fight and disagrees with Trump on a host of issues, declined to attend the convention held in his own state. Instead, he greeted his supporters at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame close to the convention arena to the blaring tune of The Who‚Äôs ‚ÄúBaba O‚ÄôRiley‚Äù with lyrics like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to fight to prove I‚Äôm right.‚Äù Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told reporters that Kasich was ‚Äúembarrassing his state‚Äù by refusing to get on the Trump train. His remarks were a reminder of the sort of insults that many Republicans had hoped would disappear after a brutal primary season that was characterized by Trump‚Äôs often personal attacks on his opponents. The pleas for unity were frequent in Cleveland, led by House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican, who has been slow in warming to Trump. ‚ÄúWhat do you say that we unify this party at this crucial moment when unity is everything?‚Äù Ryan asked thousands of convention attendees on Tuesday night. It was the biggest applause line of his speech - delegates cheered, clapped and waved signs. But U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, one of the ‚Äúnever Trump‚Äù holdouts, is still not convinced.  ‚ÄúFederalism and separation of powers ‚Äì if he focuses on that, he brings along a lot of conservatives like me who haven‚Äôt been sold yet,‚Äù Lee told Reuters. ‚ÄúHe needs to make that a distinct part of his message.‚Äù Trump and his surrogates have offered scant policy details so far at the convention, nor have they been able to put to rest questions about whether they are capable of mounting a sophisticated presidential campaign to take on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The convention has been overshadowed, for example, by controversy surrounding his wife Melania‚Äôs convention speech - which included lines uttered by first lady Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008 - and the campaign‚Äôs initial reluctance to admit the plagiarism. Some Republicans thought it was an unnecessary distraction at a time when the party should be focused on selling itself and its new leader to Americans.  Others said that if Trump was really serious about uniting the party he would reach out to his vanquished foes on the campaign trail, including Cruz and Kasich.   Ken Cope, a Texas delegate who had backed Cruz for president but will vote for Trump, said the New York businessman needs to ‚Äúswallow his pride‚Äù and stress the contributions his 16 defeated rivals made to the primary process instead of belittling them. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a prideful man and he‚Äôs proud of what he is but we‚Äôre in a general election campaign and it‚Äôs going to take all of us pulling on the rope if we‚Äôre going to pull the ship to the final line,‚Äù Cope said. Still others said Trump needed to be more disciplined. Trump supporter John Whitmer, a delegate from Wichita, Kansas, said Trump made a mistake by going on Fox News on Monday night to rail against Kasich as speakers were lauding his candidacy at the televised convention. ‚ÄúYou just stepped on your best act,‚Äù Whitmer said. ‚ÄúI get that you want to talk about Kasich, but everybody needed to be watching what was going on there.‚Äù After Wednesday night, the best hope for the Republican Party to come together may rest on Clinton, who was frequently vilified at the Cleveland convention this week. She will be formally nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee at her party‚Äôs convention in Philadelphia next week. When asked if the party was unified, former Speaker of the House of Representatives and close Trump adviser, Newt Gingrich, replied: ‚ÄúNo, but we will be by the end of Philadelphia.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrump will get us to 90 percent unity. She‚Äôll get us the rest of the way.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "
"Trumping Trump, Vattenfall to build Scottish wind farm near golf resort","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden‚Äôs Vattenfall will invest 3 billion Swedish crowns ($349 million) in a Scottish offshore wind farm that U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump tried to stop being built near his luxury golf course in Scotland. State-owned utility Vattenfall, which will take 100 percent ownership of the project from Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group, described its investment as a vote of confidence in Britain after the nation‚Äôs decision to leave the European Union. ‚ÄúThe decision to invest ... comes only a few weeks after the British referendum on leaving the EU and demonstrates Vattenfall‚Äôs continuing long-term commitment to wind power in Great Britain,‚Äù the company said in a statement. Scotland‚Äôs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would not rule out the possibility of Scotland remaining in the EU. Sturgeon said that a second independence referendum is now a possibility, though she has also emphasized that another vote would not take place until it is clear that most Scots are in favor of breaking from the United Kingdom. Vattenfall said the wind farm will have capacity of 92.4 megawatts, which could potentially supply about 130,000 households with energy. It will also serve as a center for testing and developing new technologies for offshore wind power. In December last year Britain‚Äôs top court threw out a bid by Trump to stop the 11-turbine wind farm from being built near his multimillion-dollar resort. The Trump Organization had denounced the Scottish government as ‚Äúfoolish, small minded and parochial‚Äù. The Scottish National Party‚Äôs foreign affairs spokesman Alex Salmond replied that Trump was ‚Äúthree times a loser‚Äù. Construction is expected to start in the latter part of 2017, with the wind farm expected to start generating electricity in spring 2018. Onshore construction activity will start later this year.

U.S. has 'ironclad' commitment to NATO mutual defense: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has an ‚Äúironclad‚Äù commitment to mutual defense among the NATO allies, the White House said on Thursday after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump raised questions about whether he would defend NATO allies if they were attacked. White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to directly address Trump‚Äôs comments to The New York Times but said potential foes should make no mistake or miscalculation about Washington‚Äôs readiness to defend its NATO treaty allies. ‚ÄúThe U.S. commitment to that pledge is ironclad,‚Äù Earnest told a briefing. ‚ÄúThe president renewed that commitment just two weeks ago today when he traveled to Warsaw, Poland, to attend the NATO summit.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "

"Ted Cruz jeered for refusing to back Trump, exposing Republican rift","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ted Cruz refused to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the party‚Äôs convention on Wednesday, drawing angry jeers from Trump supporters and shattering the facade of party unity that has been carefully built up in Cleveland this week. Anti-Trump Republican delegate Ken Cuccinelli told Reuters he escorted Cruz‚Äôs wife, Heidi, off the floor of the Republican National Convention out of concern for her safety following her husband‚Äôs speech. For the third day in a row, what was supposed to be a carefully scripted show of unity was thrown into turmoil by unexpected events that have raised questions about whether the party can unite around Trump to defeat the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in the Nov. 8 election.  Cruz, who came in a distant second to Trump in the race for the Republican nomination, stopped short of endorsing Trump after a bitter and personal campaign and mentioned him only once, drawing boos and repeated chants of ‚ÄúWe want Trump.‚Äù Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general, said: ‚ÄúWhen the speech ended, there was an ugly crowd behind us.‚Äù A witness said one person shouted: ‚ÄúGoldman Sachs‚Äù at Heidi Cruz in reference to her employment at the investment bank. Cruz began his speech saying: ‚ÄúI want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night.‚Äù  Later in the speech, he urged: ‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.‚Äù Some critics saw the appeal for people to vote their conscience as a vote of no-confidence in Trump. Republican strategist Eric Fehrnstrom, who is not affiliated with any campaign, tweeted: ‚Äú‚ÄòVote your conscience‚Äô was the rallying cry of the Never Trump movement. For Cruz to bring that message into #RNC hall was a colossal error.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taken me about 30 minutes to calm down and stop shaking with anger,‚Äù said Erik Layton, an alternate delegate from California who had shouted: ‚ÄúGo home‚Äù at Cruz after his speech. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know why Cruz did this. It baffles my mind.‚Äù Trump, 70, a businessman and former reality TV star who has never been elected to public office, made his entrance to the convention hall near the end of Cruz‚Äôs speech, applauding Cruz‚Äôs remarks but, by his appearance, drawing attention away from his former rival. In a tweet after the convention adjourned for the night, Trump wrote that Cruz broke a promise they both had made to endorse the party‚Äôs White House choice. ‚ÄúWow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn‚Äôt honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!‚Äù Trump wrote. During the campaign for the party‚Äôs nomination, Trump insulted Cruz‚Äôs wife‚Äôs looks and suggested the Texan‚Äôs father was with John F. Kennedy‚Äôs assassin just before the president was shot in Dallas in 1963.  Cruz, 45, who as a Tea Party conservative in the U.S. Senate angered many mainstream Republicans in Congress and spearheaded tactics that led to a government shutdown over the federal budget, called Trump a ‚Äúserial philanderer‚Äù and a ‚Äúnarcissist‚Äù during the campaign. A Cruz adviser who asked to remain anonymous said Cruz anticipated a backlash from the crowd if he did not endorse Trump. ‚ÄúWe knew people were going to be mad if he didn‚Äôt say the words, but he congratulated him and called for unity behind common values. He expected people to not be thrilled about this,‚Äù the adviser said.  Trump won the party‚Äôs nomination on Tuesday with 1,725 delegates, followed by Cruz with 475 delegates. Several delegates were outraged by the reaction to Cruz‚Äôs speech, saying it could undermine Trump‚Äôs support among Republicans who had supported the senator from Texas. ‚ÄúI thought it was shameful,‚Äù said Manette Merrill, a Cruz delegate from Washington state, adding she was now confident she would not vote for Trump in November. ‚ÄúThey talk about unity ... and then they act like that. That is not going to get us to unify,‚Äù she said. The drama did not prevent Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, from receiving a raucous welcome inside the convention hall to end the day‚Äôs events. Accepting the convention‚Äôs nomination, Pence spoke of Trump as a friend of the working class who has persevered in the business world. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers,‚Äù Pence said. Trump briefly joined Pence on the stage, shook his hand, patted him on the back, gave a thumbs-up and, in a signal to the crowd, pointed at Pence. But the Cruz speech, the latest in a series of disruptions, overshadowed any show of solidarity. Cruz swiftly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter and Facebook immediately following his speech, with about 157 tweets mentioning his official Twitter handle @tedcruz posted every minute. The overall immediate sentiment was slightly more positive than negative, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. The most mentioned moment on Twitter on Wednesday was the crowd‚Äôs reaction to Trump‚Äôs arrival at the conclusion of Cruz‚Äôs speech. Cruz was also the most mentioned speaker of the night, followed by Pence. Cruz was the most searched speaker on Google. In a speech minutes after Cruz finished, former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich veered from his prepared text to defend Cruz. ‚ÄúI think you misunderstood one paragraph that Ted Cruz, who is a superb orator, said. And I just want to point it out to you. Ted Cruz said you can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the Constitution. In this election, there is only one candidate who will uphold the Constitution,‚Äù Gingrich said. ‚ÄúTo paraphrase Ted Cruz, if you want to protect the Constitution of the United States, the only possible candidate this fall is the Trump-Pence Republican ticket,‚Äù Gingrich said. The convention, due to end on Thursday with Trump‚Äôs speech accepting the party‚Äôs nomination, has been marked by turmoil from Day One. On Monday, chaos erupted when Trump opponents inside his party stormed out of the room and others chanted to vent frustration over a failed attempt to force a vote in opposition to Trump. On Tuesday, similarities between some phrases in a speech by Trump‚Äôs wife, Melania, and a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama triggered accusations of plagiarism, putting the Trump campaign on the defensive. A staff writer for the Trump Organization on Wednesday took responsibility for the ‚Äúchaos‚Äù over the speech. Eminent Republicans such as the party‚Äôs previous two presidential nominees, Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain, and members of the Bush family that gave the party its last two presidents have stayed away from Cleveland in a show of displeasure at Trump and his rhetoric against illegal immigration and free trade. Opponents brand Trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims and to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. Underscoring the problems Trump has faced with U.S. allies abroad, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Reuters on Wednesday that Trump threatened U.S. and world security with his ‚Äúpolitics of fear and isolation.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "
Exclusive: Trump considering fracking mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary - sources,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is considering nominating Oklahoma oil and gas mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary if elected to the White House on Nov. 8, according to four sources close to Trump‚Äôs campaign. The chief executive of Continental Resources (CLR.N) would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the oil and gas industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trump‚Äôs pro-drilling energy platform.  Dan Eberhart, an oil investor and Republican financier, said he had been told by officials in Trump‚Äôs campaign that Hamm, who has been an informal advisor to Trump on energy policy since at least May, was ‚Äúthe leading contender‚Äù for the position.  Eberhart said he had discussed the possible appointment with  top donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where Trump was formally nominated as the party‚Äôs candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Three other sources close to the Trump campaign confirmed Trump was considering Hamm for the post. One of the sources said he first heard that Hamm was a contender from Trump officials on Sunday. None of the sources was aware of who else Trump may be considering for the job. Representatives for Trump and Hamm did not respond to a request for comment.  Addressing the convention on Wednesday night, Hamm called for expanded drilling and said too much environmental regulation    threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the country‚Äôs dependence on Middle Eastern oil producers. ‚ÄúEvery time we can‚Äôt drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded,‚Äù Hamm told the cheering crowd. ‚ÄúEvery onerous regulation puts American lives at risk.‚Äù     Hamm, 70, became one of America‚Äôs wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into new hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakota‚Äôs shale fields. Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology and dealing with nuclear waste disposal, have typically boasted a political or academic background. This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job. The Republican Party‚Äôs presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind.  He made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex-wife $975 million - reported to be the biggest divorce settlement in history. His fortune is now estimated at nearly $12 billion.   ‚ÄúFRACKER-IN-CHIEF‚Äù Trump, who has yet to make any announcements about his prospective cabinet, has already surrounded himself with strong advocates of traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and coal and has promised to gut environmental regulations to boost drilling and mining if elected. He tapped U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a climate skeptic and drilling advocate, to help draw up his campaign energy platform, and picked Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also a climate skeptic, as his running mate.  Both moves cheered the energy industry but alarmed environmental activists who say a Trump presidency would set back years of progress on issues like pollution and climate change.  ‚ÄúGiven that Hamm‚Äôs as close as we‚Äôve got to a fracker-in-chief in this country, it would be an apropos pick for a president who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese,‚Äù said leading environmental activist Bill McKibben.¬† Trump‚Äôs Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has promised to bolster regulation and increase use of renewable fuels to combat climate change if elected.

"Once a self-funder, Trump's new fundraising machine ramps up","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who gained popularity partly by bashing wealthy donors and vowing to fund his own campaign, raised nearly as much money in June as the campaign of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to federal reports filed on Wednesday. In the first month in which the Trump campaign‚Äôs fundraising machine officially cranked up, Trump raised nearly $20 million from individual donors other than himself, as well as $2 million from donors to his joint fundraising committee with the Republican Party. The reports also showed that Trump converted the nearly $50 million in loans he made to his campaign into donations. He has $20 million in cash in the bank.  Clinton‚Äôs campaign brought in $24 million from individual donors during the same period, and a further $11.5 million from donors to her joint fundraising committee.  Trump‚Äôs new money dash was also evident at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where two Trump Super PACs - each dueling for supremacy and boasting a roster of marquee donors - held private events. Those in the donor class backing Trump include investor Foster Friess and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who associates say is considering pouring as much as $100 million into helping Trump get elected.

"China upset by U.S. Republican platform on South China Sea, Tibet","BEIJING (Reuters) - China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry on Thursday urged the U.S. Republican Party to stop making ‚Äúgroundless accusations‚Äù against China in its party platform, which says China practices cultural genocide in Tibet and has ludicrous claims in the South China Sea. China‚Äôs government has generally avoided making direct comments about the election, wary of being seen to interfere, though in April Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei called Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump an ‚Äúirrational type‚Äù due to his tariffs proposal on imported Chinese goods. In an English-language statement issued via the official Xinhua news agency on Thursday, the ministry said the Republican platform contained ‚Äúaccusations about China on issues related to Taiwan, Tibet, trade and the South China Sea‚Äù and are an interference in China‚Äôs internal affairs. ‚ÄúAll political parties in the United States should view China‚Äôs development in an objective and rational manner and correctly understand the issues that emerge in bilateral ties,‚Äù the ministry said. ‚ÄúWe hope relevant parties stop their groundless accusations against China and interference in China‚Äôs domestic affairs and contribute more to bilateral trust and cooperation,‚Äù it added. The platform, adopted on Monday, says China has been asserting ‚Äúpreposterous‚Äù claims to the South China Sea to distract its people from economic problems, practices ‚Äúcultural genocide‚Äù in Tibet and Xinjiang, and reaffirms a commitment to sell weapons to self-ruled Taiwan. China‚Äôs foreign ministry said promoting stable growth in relations serves the interests of both countries and the peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world, and ‚Äúboth sides should adhere to this right direction‚Äù.

Factbox: Clinton to name running mate as early as Friday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is running against Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election, is expected to announce her running mate as early as Friday. Here are some of the potential vice presidential candidates Clinton is considering, according to U.S. news media: The U.S. senator from Virginia is a former Roman Catholic missionary and civil rights lawyer who is fluent in Spanish. Kaine, a former Richmond mayor and former Virginia governor, has served on the Senate‚Äôs Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees. ¬†¬†¬† He has backed liberal causes such as establishing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But, like many Republicans and moderate Democrats, he has supported free-trade deals, a stance at odds with many party progressives. The U.S. agriculture secretary is a former governor of Iowa.  During the primary, he campaigned enthusiastically for Clinton, speaking about his family‚Äôs struggles with addiction and mental health. Clinton has promised to address those issues if elected. Vilsack, a Pittsburgh native, was orphaned and adopted as an infant. He settled in his wife‚Äôs home state of Iowa. New Jersey‚Äôs first black U.S. senator is a former Newark mayor. He was elected to the Senate in a 2013 special election and won re-election in 2014. Booker campaigned enthusiastically for Clinton, including in the crucial early-voting state of New Hampshire during her primary race against Senator Bernie Sanders. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a fierce critic of Wall Street who spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the global financial crisis. President Barack Obama tapped her to help set up the agency, but congressional Republicans blocked her appointment. Warren is popular with progressives, and was urged to run for president in 2016 but declined. She endorsed Clinton in June, then joined her on the campaign trail. The retired Navy admiral and former supreme allied commander of NATO is the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University near Boston. Stavridis worked closely with Clinton when he was at NATO and she led the State Department during Obama‚Äôs first term. Though Stavridis would bring military heft to Clinton‚Äôs ticket, his role as a senior military official in the George W. Bush administration during the early years of the U.S. occupation of Iraq could provide Trump with a line of attack. Trump has criticized Clinton for, as a U.S. senator, voting for the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.  The U.S. senator from Ohio and former member of the U.S. House of Representatives is one of the Democratic Party‚Äôs leading progressives. Brown was an early opponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement sought by the Obama administration, describing it as a ‚Äúgiveaway to corporations.‚Äù Obama‚Äôs labor secretary has championed changes in regulations popular with organized labor and progressives.  Perez reversed a regulation exempting domestic and home-care workers from overtime pay and extended overtime protections to some salaried workers by lowering the eligibility threshold.  Perez has little campaigning experience, however, having only held one term on a county council from 2002 to 2006.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary is considered a rising Democratic star. Castro has pushed for expanding opportunities while serving as housing secretary, including by broadening internet access across the country. But progressive groups have criticized his agency‚Äôs sale of mortgage loans to big banks rather than non-profits during his tenure. A former San Antonio mayor, Castro was elected as the city‚Äôs youngest councilman at the age of 26.  ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 "
Green Republicans resist Trump's climate denial in Cleveland,"CLEVELAND/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and has vowed not to let regulation stand in the way of expanded U.S. oil drilling if elected. But a group of his supporters at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week are lobbying him to soften that stance. Youth, religious and investor activists aligned with the Republican Party are working the sidelines of the July 18-22 conclave, arguing that a greener platform could help the New York businessman-turned-politician win voters in November. ‚ÄúIn an age where the Republicans are particularly interested in winning the presidency, they are not supporting an agenda that reflects that most Americans recognize climate change is a problem,‚Äù said Rachel Lamb, national organizer for¬†the Young Evangelicals for Climate Action group. Lamb and representatives from other organizations like the Greater Cleveland Young Republicans, environmental advocacy group RepublicEn, and clean energy foundation ClearPath taken part in panel discussions and held private meetings with operatives on the sidelines of the convention. Trump was formally nominated on Tuesday to compete in the Nov. 8 presidential election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who has made combating climate change a key theme in her campaign. The Republican Party has adopted a platform that calls coal a ‚Äúclean‚Äù source of electricity and would open more federal land to drilling and mining, while Trump has said he would reverse some of President Barack Obama‚Äôs key climate change initiatives. Some 64 percent of U.S. adults say they are worried a ‚Äúgreat deal‚Äù or a ‚Äúfair amount‚Äù about global warming, the highest reading since 2008, according to the results of a Gallup poll released in March. Cade Marsh, a representative of the College Republican National Committee, said he was hoping to convince Republicans in Cleveland this week that environmentalism and conservatism are not mutually exclusive. ‚Äú‚ÄòClimate change‚Äô is a word that is seen as far left,‚Äù Marsh said. ‚ÄúBut if you repackage clean energy in terms of national security and liberty, you‚Äôll find people much more receptive,‚Äù he said, referring to the role of renewable energy sources like wind power and solar power in reducing dependence on foreign oil. He said his message has been warmly received by convention attendees, but that he held out little hope of a turnaround in Trump‚Äôs policies. ‚ÄúThis is about tomorrow‚Äôs Republican party,‚Äù Marsh said. Jay Faison, a North Carolina Republican donor who founded the ClearPath foundation, said he was telling Republican operatives in Cleveland this week that he would prefer to fund candidates who can put clean energy on the party‚Äôs agenda. ‚ÄúI wonder about the opportunities with the persuadable voters in the middle in terms of the general election,‚Äù he said.

Trump employee apologizes for Melania speech 'chaos',"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A staff writer for the Trump Organization took responsibility on Wednesday for the ‚Äúchaos‚Äù caused by a speech given by the wife of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that drew accusations of plagiarism and cast a shadow over the party‚Äôs convention this week. The writer, Meredith McIver, apologized and offered an explanation that threw into sharp relief two days of efforts by the Trump campaign to deny there had been a problem with Melania Trump‚Äôs speech on Monday night. The Republican convention in Cleveland, which formally anointed Trump on Tuesday as the party nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, was meant to be an occasion for the party to rally around its unorthodox White House candidate after a bitterly divisive primary campaign. But the accusations of plagiarism, and the Trump campaign‚Äôs responses to them, have been a major talking point just as the party tries to showcase a candidate who it believes can appeal to voters and a campaign operation capable of beating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. In a statement, McIver said she had inserted passages into the Melania Trump speech that resembled parts of a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, when Barack Obama was in his first campaign for the presidency. McIver said she had offered to resign over the speech controversy, but Trump and his family had rejected the offer.  The Trump Organization is owned by Donald Trump. Trump defended McIver in an ABC News interview on Wednesday, saying: ‚ÄúShe made a mistake. People make mistakes. You‚Äôve made mistakes. We all make mistakes.‚Äù He said McIver had been with him for a long time and was a ‚Äúgood person.‚Äù Trump added: ‚ÄúI thought it was terrific the way she came forward and just said, ‚ÄòLook, it was a mistake that I made.‚Äô She thought it was very unfair to Melania.‚Äù In her speech on Monday, Melania Trump spoke of passing on to the next generation the value of hard work that she inherited from her parents and said that ‚Äúthe only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect,‚Äù Melania Trump told the Cleveland convention. In Denver eight years ago, Michelle Obama said she and her husband, Barack, ‚Äúwere raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you‚Äôre going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect.‚Äù     McIver said Melania Trump had read passages from Michelle Obama‚Äôs speech over the phone to her as examples. McIver then wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in a draft that became Melania Trump‚Äôs speech. McIver said in her statement that Michelle Obama is a person Melania Trump ‚Äúhas always liked.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI did not check Mrs. Obama‚Äôs speeches. This was my mistake and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama. No harm was meant,‚Äù McIver said. Nowhere in the statement by McIver and comments by Trump campaign officials on the speech has there been any sense of irony that the wife of the Republican nominee was inspired by the words of Michelle Obama at the same time that speaker after speaker at the Republican convention, echoing Trump, assailed her husband‚Äôs policies. Democrats have seized on the similarities in the speech and the Trump campaign‚Äôs various explanations over the ensuing 48 hours as showing that his team is not ready for prime time. The charge was all the more embarrassing because Trump has repeatedly slammed Clinton as untrustworthy. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Wednesday the similarities showed the country‚Äôs values were largely shared, even if political leaders had differences. ‚ÄúThat certainly buttresses an argument that the president has been making quite frequently of late, about the country not being as divided as it might seem,‚Äù Earnest told reporters.  Questions have lingered over why the Trump campaign had not run simple plagiarism software that is commonly used to ensure that speakers do not inadvertently lift other people‚Äôs words, and why the campaign sought to deny and brush away the problem. Republican strategist Ted Newton, president of Gravity Strategic Communications and a staffer in Republican Mitt Romney‚Äôs failed 2012 presidential campaign, said the Trump campaign should have come clean much sooner. ‚ÄúIt sort of reflects the old adage: It‚Äôs not the crime, it‚Äôs the cover-up,‚Äù Newton said. ‚ÄúTo have it bungled so badly is really a shame and sad for her.‚Äù If the campaign had admitted what happened sooner, Newton said, ‚ÄúIt would have been a bump in the road.‚Äù Hours before giving the speech, Melania Trump, a Slovenian-born jewelry designer and former model, told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù that she had written it with as little help as possible. But her husband‚Äôs campaign manager, Paul Manafort, told CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúThis Morning‚Äù on Tuesday that it was a collaboration with speech writers. As late as Wednesday, just hours before McIver‚Äôs statement, Manafort was pressed again on the issue on CNN. He did not say words had been lifted from the Michelle Obama speech and sought to stress the overall effectiveness of the speech. ‚ÄúThe controversy that you‚Äôre talking about is not meaningful at all,‚Äù he said.  McIver is listed as a writer on some of Trump‚Äôs most popular books, including ‚ÄúTrump: How to Get Rich‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrump: Think Like a Billionaire.‚Äù Her author‚Äôs biography in ‚ÄúHow to Get Rich‚Äù says she was a Ford Foundation scholar who graduated from the University of Utah, as well as a member of the Trump Organization.

Exclusive: Trump could seek new law to purge government of Obama appointees,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - If he wins the presidency, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and could ask Congress to pass legislation making it easier to fire public workers, Trump ally, Chris Christie, said on Tuesday. Christie, who is governor of New Jersey and leads Trump‚Äôs White House transition team, said the campaign was drawing up a list of federal government employees to fire if Trump defeats Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  ‚ÄúAs you know from his other career, Donald likes to fire people,‚Äù Christie told a closed-door meeting with dozens of  donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters and two participants in the meeting. Christie was referring to Trump‚Äôs starring role in the long-running television show ‚ÄúThe Apprentice,‚Äù where his catch-phrase was ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fired!‚Äù The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Trump‚Äôs transition advisers fear that Obama may convert these appointees to civil servants, who have more job security than officials who have been politically appointed. This would allow officials to keep their jobs in a new, possibly Republican, administration, Christie said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called burrowing,‚Äù Christie said. ‚ÄúYou take them from the political appointee side into the civil service side, in order to try to set up ... roadblocks for your successor, kind of like when all the Clinton people took all the Ws off the keyboard when George Bush was coming into the White House.‚Äù Christie was referring to pranks committed during the presidential transition from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush in 2001. During that period, some White House staffers removed the W key on computer keyboards and left derogatory signs and stickers in offices, according to a report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress. ‚ÄúOne of the things I have suggested to Donald is that we have to immediately ask the Republican Congress to change the civil service laws. Because if they do, it will make it a lot easier to fire those people,‚Äù Christie said. He said firing civil servants was ‚Äúcumbersome‚Äù and ‚Äútime-consuming.‚Äù Christie also said that changing the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency, long a target of Republicans concerned about over regulation, would be a top priority for Trump should he win in November. Trump has previously vowed to eliminate the EPA and roll back some of America‚Äôs most ambitious environmental policies, actions that he says would revive the U.S. oil and coal industries and bolster national security. Christie added that the Trump team wants to let businesspeople serve in government part time without having to give up their jobs in the private sector. Trump frequently says he is better equipped to be president because of his business experience. Although Christie was repeatedly asked during the meeting, he declined to name any potential Cabinet picks. He said Trump was not ready to do that yet. Responding to Christie‚Äôs comments on targeting political appointees on Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that allowing appointees to apply for career civil service positions was ‚Äúa longstanding precedent.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf you want to stack up the ethical record of President Obama and his political appointees against the ethical record compiled by Governor Christie and his political appointees, that we‚Äôd welcome that kind of comparison,‚Äù he said. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union in the United States, said while it was concerned about the practice of ‚Äúburrowing,‚Äù current law protected most federal employees from at will firing. ‚ÄúThe federal government is a serious undertaking. It‚Äôs not a reality TV show, with ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre fired!‚Äô‚Äù said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at AFGE. ‚ÄúJust as we don‚Äôt want to hire anybody for political reasons, we don‚Äôt want anybody to be fired for political reasons,‚Äù she said. As of March 2016, there were a total of 3,164 political appointees, 852 of whom were presidential appointees.  In its most recent report on the topic, the Government Accountability Office said in 2010 that 143 former political appointees and congressional employees converted to career positions between May 1, 2005, and May 30, 2009.  The Republican-controlled House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee is investigating the practice of burrowing. It sent letters dated Wednesday to 23 federal departments and agencies, asking them to document all cases of burrowing that have occurred since Sept. 1, 2015. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 "
U.S. appeals court voids forfeiture of Iran-linked New York office tower,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said on Wednesday the U.S. government cannot seize a Midtown Manhattan office tower originally built by the Shah of Iran, whose owners it claimed were fronts for the Iranian government. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also said hundreds of victims of ‚Äúterrorist acts‚Äù linked to Iran could not force the owners of 650 Fifth Avenue to turn over the building or pay unsatisfied money judgments they had won against the country, finding no proof that the owners and Iran were legally one and the same. Both decisions were written by Circuit Judge Richard Wesley for a unanimous three-judge panel, and totaled 145 pages. They overturned rulings by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest against the nonprofit Alavi Foundation, which promotes Islamic culture and the Persian language, and 650 Fifth Avenue Co, of which Alavi is a 60 percent owner. The owners had claimed they were given no chance to show why they should not be held liable. Iran was not a defendant in the lawsuits, which were returned to Forrest‚Äôs courtroom, including for a possible trial in the government‚Äôs forfeiture case. ‚ÄúWe are very pleased,‚Äù Daniel Ruzumna, a lawyer for the owners, said in an email. ‚ÄúWe look forward to vindicating our clients‚Äô rights and interests at trial.‚Äù James Bernard, a lawyer for the victims, said his clients also looked forward to a trial. The office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan did not respond to a request for comment. The 36-story building in question is just north of Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral, and would likely fetch hundreds of millions of dollars in a sale. In seeking the forfeiture of that building, several other properties and various bank accounts, authorities accused Alavi of engaging in money laundering that violated U.S. sanctions against Iran, and knowing that the building‚Äôs minority owner, Assa Corp, was backed by state-controlled Bank Melli. But Wesley said Forrest failed to properly review evidence that demonstrated a ‚Äúgenuine dispute‚Äù as to whether Alavi knew of Bank Melli‚Äôs control over Assa. He also said Forrest acted too quickly in rejecting defense arguments that authorities waited too long to seek a forfeiture, and that evidence obtained by a search warrant should have been suppressed. In the victims‚Äô case, Wesley said Forrest erred in finding that the building‚Äôs owners could under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act qualify as Iran itself, or be deemed its agents or instrumentalities. The appeals court directed Forrest to examine whether the victims could prevail under another federal law, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The cases are In re: 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2027; and Kirschenbaum et al v. 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties in the same court, No. 14-1963.

"Daimler AG, Ferrari selling some new vehicles with faulty air bags: U.S. Senate report","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Daimler AG‚Äôs Mercedes-Benz USA and Daimler Vans units and Ferrari NV are among a small group of automakers selling some new vehicles with faulty Takata airbags that will be subject to recalls by the end of 2018, a U.S. Senate report said on Wednesday. The vehicles are legal to sell since the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has said they will not become potentially unsafe until exposed to high humidity for an extended period. Safety advocates and some in Congress have criticized the sale of vehicles that will be recalled. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said the vehicles include the 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and 2016-2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe/Convertible and numerous 2016 and 2017 Ferrari models including the FF, California T, 488 GTB/488 Spider, F12/F12tdf and GTC4 Lusso. Nelson said the report underscores ‚Äúthe failure of certain automakers and regulators to level with people about the true extent of the problem and to have the cars fixed before they‚Äôre sold.‚Äù Mercedes Benz USA spokeswoman Donna Boland said the company has told regulators that its ‚Äúdealers will be informing prospective buyers of the pending recall on these models at the time of purchase in the very near future.‚Äù Ferrari spokeswoman Krista Florin said the Italian automaker also plans to notify customers of the future recalls.Seven out of 17 automakers Nelson contacted have admitted to equipping some new vehicles with defective Takata airbags, including Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). All agreed to notify buyers of the planned recalls. Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) is the only automaker that has not provided a written response, Nelson said. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday from Reuters. NHTSA said in May Tesla would be required to recall vehicles for Takata inflators. Takata inflators can explode with excessive force and spray metal shrapnel. They are suspected in at least 13 deaths worldwide and more than 100 injuries. In May, Takata agreed to declare as defective, by 2018, another 35 million to 40 million U.S. inflators that lack drying agents in frontal airbags after 14 automakers previously recalled more than 24 million U.S. vehicles. Worldwide nearly 100 million inflators have been declared defective. NHTSA said there have been no ruptures in vehicles built since 2008. According to NHTSA, the vehicles do not become vulnerable to exploding airbags without long-term exposure to high humidity. In the short-term, the agency says, they are safe to drive and much safer than older models. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 "
Trump staff writer takes responsibility for Melania speech controversy,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A staff writer of the Trump Organization, the company owned by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, has claimed responsibility for inserting passages in a speech given at the Republican National Convention by Trump‚Äôs wife Melania that resembled parts of a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama.

"In a first, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce endorses Clinton for president","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton, the group‚Äôs first-ever endorsement for a presidential nominee and a rebuke of Republican Donald Trump in the middle of his party‚Äôs convention. The Trump campaign ‚Äúhas gone from frankly something that was entertaining, comical, and has devolved into something that is frankly scary,‚Äù said Javier Palomarez, the chamber president and chief executive officer. He said the group weighed in because of Trump‚Äôs rhetoric, which has angered many in the U.S. minority community. Trump has been accused of bigotry for his hard line on immigration, and many of his comments have been blasted as racist ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a step that was taken easily,‚Äù Palomarez said, noting that many of the chamber‚Äôs board and members are ‚Äústaunch Republicans.‚Äù Trump kicked off his campaign last year saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers across the border, and he proposed building a wall to stop them. He has called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants to shore up national security and suggested an Indiana-born federal judge was unable to hear a lawsuit against his Trump University venture because the judge is of Mexican descent.  The New York businessman‚Äôs positions have angered minority groups, liberals, Democrats, and even some Republicans, who have called them racist, divisive and callous.  Among black, Hispanic and Asian voters polled in the first 15 days of July, 70 percent supported Clinton while 9 percent supported Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Over that time, 45 percent of all likely voters supported Clinton and 34 percent supported Trump.  Trump became his party‚Äôs official nominee to the presidency on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Palomarez said the Clinton campaign earned their group‚Äôs endorsement by doing significant outreach to Latinos, including asking to speak with chamber members in different parts of the country.  ‚ÄúI think she understands the challenges of American small businesses,‚Äù he said. The convention had a dramatic start, as anti-Trump delegates tried, and failed, to force a roll-call vote that would record the number of delegates opposed to the New York real estate developer. The chamber is an organization of Hispanic business leaders representing the interests of Hispanic-owned businesses nationwide. It had endorsed Clinton and Republican John Kasich in their respective primaries, the group‚Äôs first-ever such endorsements. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 "
Campaign aims to register a million U.S. Muslims voters in anti-Trump move,"FALLS CHURCH, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. Muslim leaders hope to register a million voters from within their community to help combat what they say is the anti-Muslim stance of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The United States has only about 3.3 million Muslims, but campaign organizers say Muslim voters could have an outsize impact in swing states that are key to the November general election, such as Virginia and Florida. ‚ÄúWe want the Muslim community to understand that if you give up your rights voluntarily, no one will come and give it back to you,‚Äù said Osama Abu Irshaid, a member of the board of the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations, which is spearheading the drive. Imams have been asked to encourage their congregations to register to vote. Organizers have sent canvassers to college campuses, bus stations and gas stations in Muslim neighborhoods. The campaign began in December and is part of an effort among U.S. Muslims to combat an ‚Äúunprecedented rise in Islamophobia,‚Äù said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR‚Äôs database showed that 300,000 Muslims had registered since November, he said. Awad said anti-Muslim sentiment had grown since the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, last year that authorities have said was inspired by Islamist militants, and due to comments by Trump. He has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants. Campaign volunteers were outside the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in suburban Washington this month to get worshippers to register. ‚ÄúI was thinking quite a long time to register but this time especially ... I really believed that I have to,‚Äù said Sadat Najmi as he filled out a registration form. Najmi, a U.S. citizen since 1988, said Trump had motivated him to sign up for the first time. U.S. Muslim backers of Trump said they were trying to build their own coalitions in swing states.  Baltimore businessman Sajid Tarar said he launched American Muslims for Trump because he favored Trump‚Äôs stance on combating radical Islam. ‚ÄúISIS (an acronym for the Islamic State), al Qaeda, Taliban, they have killed more Muslims than anything else, and that‚Äôs a message Muslims need to hear and understand,‚Äù he said, referring to various militant groups. Michael Cohen, co-chair of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, which aims to mobilize minority support, said Muslim Americans were equally worried about violence at home and abroad. Trump is ‚Äúthe only candidate who will enhance our national security, bring jobs back to America and fix our ailing economy,‚Äù he said in an email. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 "
"Behind the scenes, Ryan touts his agenda in Cleveland, not Trump's","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan offered his strongest support yet for Donald Trump‚Äôs White House bid on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention, saying the New York businessman he has repeatedly criticized provides America ‚Äúa chance at a better way.‚Äù  Behind the scenes in Cleveland, the highest-ranking elected Republican has been shopping a competing vision for the party, backed by some wealthy donors and Republican establishment figures who see him as the savior of a party thrown into turmoil by Trump‚Äôs candidacy. The support reflects deep divisions within the party over Trump‚Äôs harder line on stemming illegal immigration and his threats to scrap trade deals that he says have hurt American workers but establishment Republicans view as central to their free trade policies. The split has created an identity crisis for the party, embodied in the figures of Trump and Ryan.  ‚ÄúEverybody knows the tough spot Paul Ryan is in,‚Äù said Annie Dickerson, a New York delegate to the convention and close adviser to Republican financier Paul Singer, referring to Ryan‚Äôs dilemma in backing a candidate as the party‚Äôs standard bearer in the Nov. 8 presidential election who does not represent many of its traditional values. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the antidote to all the frustration that‚Äôs in Cleveland this week,‚Äù she said, noting that despite a public push for unity, there are those still unhappy with Trump‚Äôs nomination. Ryan, 46, is chairman of the convention at which Trump was officially nominated on Tuesday. But he has kept a low profile, avoiding the convention‚Äôs opening day on Monday, and instead holding meetings with state delegations and addressing private gatherings of Republican supporters, according to aides and attendees. At the meetings, according to attendees, Ryan has been pushing his ‚ÄúBetter GOP‚Äù platform, a six-part agenda that shares strong similarities to the form of conservatism President George W. Bush advocated - reduced regulation, lower taxes, and welfare reform. It contrasts with the speeches typically delivered by Trump, who prefers to lambaste his opponents and skip detailed policy discussions. Doug Heye, a former House Republican leadership aide close to Ryan, said Ryan‚Äôs platform ‚Äúgives them something that they can talk to constituents about that isn‚Äôt divisive, that isn‚Äôt name calling.‚Äù  Heye said the approach could help Ryan position himself as the face of the party if Trump loses the election.  Ryan has publicly clashed with Trump over the latter‚Äôs promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants and end trade deals. He criticized Trump‚Äôs call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country and called his remarks about the heritage of a Mexican-American judge racist. Ryan supports free trade and comprehensive immigration reform, and as chairman of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, he authored a document that called for a drastically reduced federal government.  The risk for Ryan is that a swath of the party is moving away from traditional Republican orthodoxy, and by not embracing Trump he could find himself isolated. Some of Trump‚Äôs supporters see him as emblematic of the Washington dysfunction that has angered many Republicans.  Mark Bolin, a Canton, Ohio, business owner who supports Trump, called Ryan‚Äôs tepid endorsement of Trump ‚Äúpolitical suicide.‚Äù He said Ryan and other Republicans leaders can‚Äôt admit their own failures. ‚ÄúInstead of them thinking there‚Äôs something wrong with their party, they think it must be us, the American people aren‚Äôt smart enough,‚Äù Bolin said.  Ryan has long been seen as a rising star and some wealthy donors pushed Ryan, who was the vice presidential nominee in 2012, to run for president this year. He declined but hasn‚Äôt ruled out running in the future. Advisers to Singer and the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers say the donors are banking on Ryan to carry the flag for traditional Republican values. ‚ÄúI like Ryan and his day to lead the party will come - very soon, if Trump loses,‚Äù said energy magnate Dan Eberhart, another major donor.   Linda Devore, 66, a retired attorney from Fayetteville, North Carolina, who met Ryan for the first time in 2012, rushed over to give him a hug when he arrived on Tuesday morning to speak to her delegation at a hotel in the Cleveland.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just one of the smartest Republicans. That‚Äôs what I told him,‚Äù Devore said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a quick wit. He said, ‚ÄòPretty low bar, huh?‚Äô‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 "
"Beating rivals and the odds, Trump captures Republican nomination","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Thirteen months after launching an improbable bid for the White House, Donald Trump captured the 2016 Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, having vanquished 16 party rivals, warred with much of its establishment and provoked controversy at every turn. His eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., announced the support of New York, their home state, during a roll-call vote at the Republican National Convention, ensuring Trump had the majority of delegates - 1,237 - needed to contest the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. With three of the candidate‚Äôs other children at his side, the younger Trump said: ‚ÄúIt is my honor to be able to throw Donald Trump over the top in the delegate count tonight.‚Äù ‚ÄúCongratulations, Dad. We love you,‚Äù he said. Trump‚Äôs Democratic rival, Clinton, who has been the target of withering verbal attacks during the convention, was quick to respond to the vote, tweeting: ‚ÄúDonald Trump just became the Republican nominee. Chip in now to make sure he never steps foot in the Oval Office.‚Äù Trump won with 1,725 delegates, followed by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas with 475 delegates, Ohio Governor John Kasich with 120 and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida with 114. Three other candidates emerged with a total of 12 delegates. After the presidential nominating vote, the convention by voice vote nominated Indiana Governor Mike Pence, 57, Trump‚Äôs choice for his vice presidential running mate. Speaking to the convention for the first time since winning the nomination, Trump appeared on a video screen from New York promising to win the election in November, create jobs, strengthen the military, safeguard U.S. borders and ‚Äúrestore law and order‚Äù in the United States. The state-by-state vote to put Trump‚Äôs name in nomination took place a day after opponents staged a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy at the start of the four-day convention, and after a speech by his wife, Melania, drew accusations of plagiarism. A wealthy New York real estate developer best known to Americans for his starring role in a long-running TV show, ‚ÄúThe Apprentice,‚Äù where his catchphrase was ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fired,‚Äù the 70-year-old Trump was a long shot when he entered the race for the Republican nomination more than a year ago, having never held elected office. On Tuesday, under the headline ‚ÄúMake America Work Again,‚Äù speakers at Cleveland‚Äôs Quicken Loans basketball arena were meant to assail Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs record on the economy during his nearly eight years in power. Instead, speaker after speaker took aim at Clinton, presenting her as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans and the inheritor of Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúoppressive‚Äù administration. A former secretary of state under Obama, Clinton, 68, was due to be formally nominated at the Democratic National Convention next week in Philadelphia. Trump trails Clinton in many opinion polls after a bruising Republican primary season. Trump narrowed his deficit against her to 7 percentage points from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.  Trump initially refused to rule out an independent run should he fail to win the Republican nomination.  Within weeks of announcing his candidacy at Trump Tower in New York on June 16, 2015, Trump had taken a commanding lead in the Republican race, defying pundits who were quick to write him off and eclipsing the man many had thought would be crowned on Tuesday night - former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, part of a Republican political dynasty. In a campaign marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric, Trump tapped into a deep vein of unhappiness running through white Middle America, giving voice to millions who felt left behind in the rush to globalization and who eschewed traditional establishment Republicans like Bush in favor of a brash political outsider who promised to ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lost the confidence in our leaders and the faith in our institutions,‚Äù Donald Trump Jr. said in a convention speech. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still Americans. We‚Äôre still one country and we‚Äôre going to get it all back.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôll get it back because I know my father,‚Äù Trump Jr. said. Opponents brand Trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims and to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. Underscoring the problems Trump has faced with U.S. allies abroad, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Trump threatened U.S. and world security with his ‚Äúpolitics of fear and isolation.‚Äù Steinmeier told Reuters in a written interview that he was concerned about what he called Trump‚Äôs ambiguous vows to ‚Äúmake America strong again,‚Äù while simultaneously reducing its engagement overseas. Party officials hope to use the convention to smooth out some of Trump‚Äôs rough edges and present him as a job creator and a strong hand to combat security threats at home and abroad. U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, an early backer of Trump, placed his name in nomination, calling him ‚Äúa warrior and a winner.‚Äù Two senior Republicans, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, spoke in favor of Trump. Republicans need Trump to do well in the November election as they seek to preserve Republican majorities in Congress. Security forces were on high alert in Cleveland. But police said late on Tuesday there had been only five arrests since the convention began on Monday. Wright State University, a public university near Dayton, Ohio, said on Tuesday it had decided not to host the first U.S. presidential debate scheduled for Sept. 26, citing mounting costs and security concerns. The event will now be held at Hofstra University in New York. While in Cleveland, Trump ally Chris Christie said on Tuesday that should Trump win the presidency, he would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by Obama  and could ask Congress to pass legislation making it easier to dismiss public workers. Christie, who is governor of New Jersey and leads Trump‚Äôs White House transition team, told dozens of donors the campaign was drawing up a list of federal government employees to fire if Trump defeats Clinton.

"On bike, horse and foot, police keep order outside Republican convention","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - City police on bicycles and horseback, backed by state and local officers from across the country, kept order outside the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, as predictions that protester unrest would tarnish the event did not come to pass for a second day. There have been only five arrests since the convention began on Monday, police announced at an early evening news conference. As sundown neared, the mood on downtown streets was calm. In Tuesday‚Äôs largest demonstration, police on bicycles rode into the crowd in the city‚Äôs Public Square in mid afternoon. Helmeted officers, some in protective equipment and others wearing shorts, separated a crowd of Black Lives Matters protesters from other protesters wearing masks and helmets, occasionally lifting their bikes to push through the crowd. ‚ÄúIf America is so bad, why don‚Äôt you leave?,‚Äù a pro-Trump demonstrator shouted at a group carrying signs that read, ‚ÄúAmerica was never great‚Äù A pair of men dressed in traditional Muslim garb walked near the plaza carrying assault-style rifles, with one also bearing a semiautomatic handgun. Micha Noziri of Yellow Spring, Ohio, who is not Muslim, said he wanted to take a stance against Trump‚Äôs positions on ‚Äúreligious minorities‚Äù and immigration.  ‚ÄúWe came out to show solidarity for all minority groups, the so-called minority groups that Donald Trump would oppress if he does the things that he says,‚Äù Noziri told a knot of reporters surrounding him. Ten men identifying themselves as Ohio militia walked through Public Square with weapons on open display, surrounded by a pack of journalists.  Police escorted conservative radio host Alex Jones from the square, amid shouting and jostling, after Jones used a megaphone to shout invective about Black Lives Matter and other groups toward a group of liberal-leaning protesters.   Dozens of Cleveland police on bicycles and dozens more in state police uniforms intervened. They walked Jones and a handful of supporters past a few hundred demonstrators and journalists.

Melania Trump's speech has an echo of Michelle Obama words,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Melania Trump‚Äôs speech at the Republican National Convention has ignited controversy because it contained a section strikingly similar to words delivered at the Democratic convention in 2008 by the woman she hopes to succeed as U.S. first lady, Michelle Obama. An official with the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested the similarity in the section to Michelle Obama‚Äôs speech may have been the result of an error by her team of speech writers. Donald Trump made no mention of the issue in a Twitter post early on Tuesday, saying simply: ‚ÄúIt was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania Trump last night. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud!‚Äù Trump has never held elective office and his White House campaign has been marked by frequent controversy over unorthodox policies and freewheeling remarks that have alarmed many in the Republican establishment. It is a tradition of the party conventions for spouses to offer an enthusiastic personal endorsement of candidates. On Tuesday night, the gathering in Cleveland will formally anoint Donald Trump the Republican presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election. It was a small section of Melania Trump‚Äôs roughly 15-minute speech, a highlight of the opening day of the convention, that was similar to a part of Michelle Obama‚Äôs speech in 2008 in support of Barack Obama, who was then campaigning for president. ‚ÄúMy parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect,‚Äù said Melania Trump, a Slovenian-born jewelry designer and former model. ‚ÄúThey taught me to show the values and morals in my daily life. That is the lesson that I continue to pass along to our son,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow, because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.‚Äù In 2008, Michelle Obama said, ‚ÄúAnd Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you‚Äôre going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect.‚Äù ‚Äú...And Barack Obama and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generations,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúBecause we want our children, and all children in this nation, to know that the only limit to the height of your achievement is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.‚Äù Before Monday‚Äôs speech, Melania Trump told NBC in remarks that were aired on several networks:¬†‚ÄúI wrote it... with as little help as possible.‚Äù A spokesman for the Trump campaign called the speech a success, but suggested her writers might have mistakenly injected some borrowed language. ‚ÄúIn writing her beautiful speech, Melania‚Äôs team of writers took notes on her life‚Äôs inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking,‚Äù Jason Miller, Trump‚Äôs senior communications adviser, said in a statement. Paul Manafort, chairman of the Trump campaign, played down the similarities in the Trump and Obama speeches. ‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt that many similarities. There are a couple of phrases,‚Äù Manafort told CBS News on Tuesday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically three places in the speech and it‚Äôs fragments of words. She spoke in front of 35 million people yesterday. She knew what she was doing. And she never cribbed from another speech without acknowledging that she was quoting somebody else.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was nothing that she did in that speech that she thought was anybody‚Äôs words but herself,‚Äù Manafort said. Asked if she wrote it herself, Manafort said it was a ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt know how much exactly she had written. ‚ÄúBut the words of her speech reflect her feelings for her husband, her country and her family.‚Äù ‚ÄúFrankly this was her vision that she wanted to communicate about her husband.‚Äù New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, asked if as a former prosecutor he could make a case for plagiarism from Melania Trump‚Äôs speech, replied: ‚ÄúNo, not when 93 percent of the speech is completely different from Michelle Obama‚Äôs speech, and they express common thoughts.‚Äú ‚ÄúI think after tonight we won‚Äôt be talking about this, we‚Äôll move on to whatever ... comes up tonight,‚Äù Christie, a former rival to Trump for the Republican presidential nomination who now supports him, told NBC‚Äôs Today show on Tuesday.

'We're not electing a husband:' Tough-talking Trump wins over some skeptical women,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs tough talk on law and order in a time of growing national insecurity appears to be winning over some of his fiercest skeptics - women initially put off by his swaggering tone, his clashes with female critics and past affairs.  But so far those are mostly conservative women. As Trump hones his message, the challenge is to make it also resonate among independent or undecided female voters who are crucial to his hopes of winning the U.S. presidential election in November. Turmoil on the streets both abroad and at home could give Trump a new opportunity to do just that. On Monday, Trump tried to seize it with an evening program at the Republican National Convention with several women speakers, including his wife Melania, focused on security. She told the convention that her husband would offer the country new leadership and keep it ‚Äúsafe and secure.‚Äù Americans have been rattled by recent attacks in France and Florida, the murder of police officers in Texas and Louisiana, and widespread protests over the killings of unarmed black men, polls show. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not electing a husband, we‚Äôre not electing a preacher, we‚Äôre electing a leader,‚Äù said Kay White, a Republican delegate to the nominating convention from Tennessee who originally supported U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the early nominating contests, or primaries. For White, it‚Äôs a one-issue election. ‚ÄúSecurity,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNothing else matters.‚Äù A year ago, Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, a conservative advocacy group, was a blistering critic of the thrice-married Trump because of comments he made about  Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly that many felt were sexist.  But Nance now supports Trump and says the candidate can fashion an effective message for women centered on national security, she told Reuters on the sidelines of the convention. ‚ÄúEvery day we wake up and get our kids ready for school and the television is on and there is another attack,‚Äù she said. For Trump, independents will be a tougher sell. A majority of women who identify as ‚Äúindependent‚Äù continue to hold an unfavorable opinion of him. According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll from June 1 to July 15, 64 percent of independent women voters expressed a ‚Äúvery unfavorable‚Äù or ‚Äúsomewhat unfavorable‚Äù view of Trump. That compares with 89 percent of Democratic women voters and 31 percent of Republican women voters who have a similarly unfavorable view of the New York businessman.  Trump isn‚Äôt the first candidate whose tough talk on security has won over women voters. George W. Bush used the same message in his re-election campaign in 2004, in the midst of his ‚Äúwar on terror,‚Äù to appeal to so-called security moms who were concerned about terrorism.  Bush garnered 48 percent of the vote of American women in that election. By comparison, Republican candidate Mitt Romney drew 44 percent in 2012, a full 10 points behind President Barack Obama.  Trump has had trouble convincing women nationally to support him ever since he entered the race in the summer of 2015, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Among women who are expected to vote on Nov. 8, a majority expressed an unfavorable opinion of him every time they were asked in the polls. This month, women appeared to have soured even more on the likely Republican nominee: 69 percent of likely women voters expressed an unfavorable opinion of Trump in the latest July 11-15 Reuters/Ipsos polling, up from 63 percent in the five-day poll that ended on July 1.  Jen Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University, said she doubted Trump could rehabilitate his image with most women voters, saying his conflict with Kelly, in particular, had lasting damage. ‚ÄúI think that ship has sailed,‚Äù Lawless said.  Trump‚Äôs problems with women were dramatized on Monday when Women for Trump, a voter-support group, held a sparsely attended event in Cleveland.  The moderator, Jennifer Hulsey, appeared to speak for a lot of women who have found a way to support Trump. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not perfect, but neither am I,‚Äù Hulsey said.  Some of the women delegates interviewed by Reuters at the convention on Monday were scornful of the criticism of Trump‚Äôs attitude toward women, pointing to his daughter Ivanka, who is a top executive in the Trump Organization.  Ivanka and his other daughter Tiffany are due to speak at the convention this week. ‚ÄúHe was not my first choice or even my second choice,‚Äù said   Carol Del Carlo, a Trump supporter. But, ‚ÄúI look at him and I see how he treats his daughters. They‚Äôre engaged, they look like a real, true family, they work in their father‚Äôs business, they‚Äôre advisors.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 19, 2016 "
Trump narrows gap with Clinton as Republicans rally in Cleveland: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump narrowed his deficit to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to 7 percentage points from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday,  Polling was under way on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to officially nominate Trump as the party‚Äôs candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clinton is due to be officially nominated at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia next week. Forty-three percent of likely voters supported Clinton in the July 15-19 poll, while 36 percent supported Trump. The poll included 1,069 voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.  The previous poll, in which Trump trailed Clinton by 15 percentage points, covered the five-day period that ended July 14.  Trump‚Äôs rise appeared partly fueled by a decline in the number of voters who remained on the sidelines. The percentage of voters who supported neither candidate dropped to 12 percent in the July 15-19 poll from 15 percent in the July 10-14 poll. Clinton has led in the poll most of the year.  The last time that Trump matched Clinton‚Äôs level of support was in mid-May, after his remaining rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out and many Republican leaders started to openly support his bid for the White House.  This week‚Äôs Republican convention provides another opportunity for party leaders to publicly embrace Trump‚Äôs campaign. Presidential nominees typically see a boost in voter support following their party conventions. In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney jumped by about 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos poll following the Republican convention. This year, however, Republican leaders have struggled to give a full-throated endorsement of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù campaign over his hard line on immigration and trade, and his fiery rhetoric that some have called bigoted. Many Republican elders, including both former presidents Bush and the last two presidential nominees, Romney and John McCain, are staying away from Cleveland.  The convention also has been marred by protests from anti-Trump delegates and a controversy over a speech by Trump‚Äôs wife, Melania, that included a section that was strikingly similar to a portion of the speech given by Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008 when her husband, Barack Obama, was seeking his first term as president.

Melania Trump's RNC speech produces so-so TV audience,"(Reuters) - Melania Trump‚Äôs big night at the Republican National Convention failed to draw bumper television audiences despite networks boosting their coverage of the gathering and husband Donald Trump promising a ‚Äúshowbiz‚Äù feel to the week. According to Nielsen ratings data on Tuesday from seven leading broadcast and cable networks, an estimated 23 million people watched Monday evening‚Äôs highlight during the 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. hour when Melania Trump, the wife of Republican White House contender Donald Trump, delivered her speech. The focus of the convention initially shifted on Tuesday from the formal anointing of Trump to accusations that sections of Melania Trump‚Äôs speech were strikingly similar to an address by Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008. The early viewing figures were similar to those for the first night of the Republican convention in 2012, which attracted an audience of 22.3 million, according to Nielsen.  U.S. television networks have boosted coverage of the Republican convention this year after Trump, a New York businessman, drew huge audiences during the 2016 presidential debates during the state nominating contests. Trump, the former star of ‚ÄúThe Apprentice‚Äù TV show, has promised to throw out traditional political convention scripts and ‚Äúput some showbiz‚Äù into the mix.  Media analysts predicted that viewership for Trump‚Äôs acceptance speech this week for the Republican presidential nomination could surpass the record 38 million who watched Barack Obama address the Democratic convention in 2008. In 2012, the Democratic convention generally drew more nightly TV viewers than the Republican gathering, when Mitt Romney was running for the White House. On Monday, the Fox News cable channel, as expected, got the most viewers for its convention coverage, averaging 6.4 million in the 10 p.m. hour. Among the mainstream networks, NBC led with 3.9 million. However, the biggest single program audience of Monday night was for reality show ‚ÄúThe Bachelorette,‚Äù which was seen by some  6.6 million on ABC. About 3 million people turned off when ABC switched to the convention. ",politicsNews,"July 19, 2016 "

Three arrested after hanging anti-Trump banner near Cleveland convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Three women were arrested on Tuesday after climbing a flagpole near the site of this week‚Äôs U.S. Republican National Convention and hanging a banner protesting the party‚Äôs presidential candidate, Donald Trump. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Trump our communities,‚Äù read the banner hung near Cleveland‚Äôs Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Using a ladder truck, fire officials brought down the protesters and the banner, which also had an anti-fracking message. ‚ÄúThey actually climbed the flagpole and hung a banner and our officers responded and made the arrests,‚Äù Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told reporters. ‚ÄúThey were arrested for criminal mischief.‚Äù He did not identify the people arrested. A Reuters witness who saw the incident said they were all women. A total of five people have now been arrested during the convention and its run-up; earlier one man was arrested for trying to steal a police officer‚Äôs gas mask and a woman was arrested on an outstanding warrant unrelated to protest activity. The convention, which began on Monday and runs through Thursday, has been marked by largely peaceful protests so far. The event will formally anoint Trump, a wealthy New York real estate developer, as the Republican nominee to face Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. ‚ÄúWe are still making sure that we don‚Äôt let our guard down,‚Äù Williams said, adding that the department‚Äôs strategy was to try to de-escalate tense situations. ‚ÄúThere is no need to do anything unless there is violence perpetrated against somebody.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 19, 2016 "

Supreme Court nominee out in cold as election heats up," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Merrick Garland hit an unwanted milestone on Tuesday as the federal appeals court judge‚Äôs nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court reached its 125th day with no Senate action, tying for the longest pending nomination ever to the high court.  In a move with little precedent in American history, the Republicans who control the Senate have simply refused to take any action on President Barack Obama‚Äôs nomination of Garland, 63, for a lifetime job on the nation‚Äôs top court.  Having been nominated on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, Garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington, has now matched Louis Brandeis for the longest time between nomination and Senate action.  In 1916, the Senate voted to confirm Brandeis, making him America‚Äôs first Jewish justice.  The U.S. Constitution assigns the Senate the power to confirm the president‚Äôs nominations to the Supreme Court. The Senate‚Äôs inaction on Garland has made the court vacancy a key political prize in a presidential election year.  Republicans, hopeful of winning back the White House from the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election, insist that Obama‚Äôs successor name Scalia‚Äôs replacement, who could have a lasting effect on the ideological balance of a court now split with four liberals and four conservatives.  Obama has appointed two of the current justices: liberals Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.  The White House and its allies made another push on Tuesday to highlight Republican intransigence.  ‚ÄúNow, despite Chief Judge Garland‚Äôs extraordinary qualifications, Republicans in the Senate have refused to do their job, and Chief Judge Garland‚Äôs nomination has now been pending longer than any Supreme Court nominee in history who‚Äôs nomination was not otherwise withdrawn,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.  ‚ÄúDespite his outstanding record and qualifications, Republicans have obstructed Judge Garland‚Äôs nomination in a way faced by no other Supreme Court nominee in our nation‚Äôs history,‚Äù added Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid.  The Senate is on recess until September.  For the rival presidential hopefuls, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, the Supreme Court vacancy is both a political problem and an opportunity.  In addition to Scalia‚Äôs replacement, the next president conceivably could nominate as many as three more justices. Three of the court‚Äôs current eight members already are over age 77. That means Obama‚Äôs successor could influence the court‚Äôs ideological direction for decades.  Some conservatives view Trump with suspicion. But the wealthy New York real estate developer has already floated names of conservative potential nominees in a bid to mollify some on the right.  Garland has established a reputation as a centrist in 19 years as an appellate judge. Some liberal Democrats have said Clinton, if elected, could put forth a nominee more liberal than Garland, so Republicans would be smart to approve him before Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.  Such arguments have not swayed Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who refuses to let Garland come to a vote.  The development most likely to prod Senate action is the result of the presidential election. Some Republican senators have said if Clinton wins, the Senate should confirm Garland in a ‚Äúlame-duck‚Äù post-election session out of fear Clinton would name someone far more liberal. If Clinton wins, she also could renominate Garland upon taking office.  Garland‚Äôs nomination is unusual because there has been no controversy over his suitability to sit on the Supreme Court, as there have been with some nominees in the past. He is widely respected in the legal community and has been praised by both Democrats and Republicans as a moderate.  The White House tried to persuade Republicans to accept Garland when he was first nominated in March. He met with 61 of the 100 senators. But the effort fizzled, and Republicans largely followed McConnell‚Äôs lead.  The White House since then has tried to keep the Garland nomination in the public eye, with limited success. Obama wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, pushing for Senate action.  A White House-allied group called the Constitutional Responsibility Project is running a ‚ÄúWe Need Nine‚Äù campaign that refers to the number of justices on a fully staffed court. It has bought ads in Cleveland, where the Republican presidential nominating convention began on Monday, calling for senators to ‚Äúdo your job‚Äù and bring Garland‚Äôs nomination to a Senate vote.  In the meantime, Garland is nowhere to be seen. His last public appearance was on June 15 when he spoke at an elementary school commencement event in Washington.  When nominated, Garland stepped aside from pending cases before the appeals court where he works. His only official duties now are administrative as the court's chief judge. A court official said Garland will continue to not participate in cases while the nomination is pending.¬†  ",politicsNews,"July 19, 2016 "

Trump's wife seeks to soften his image at raucous Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs wife Melania, in her first major political speech on Monday, portrayed her husband as a talented, compassionate and unrelenting leader who would unify rather than divide the country if elected to the White House. The Slovenian-born jewelry designer and former model delivered the speech, part of which strongly resembled an address given by current First Lady Michelle Obama in 2008, to a cheering crowd at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland after a one-minute introduction from Trump.  The presumptive Republican nominee made a dramatic entrance, silhouetted against a white background, to the accompaniment of Queen‚Äôs 1977 rock anthem, ‚ÄúWe Are the Champions.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have been with Donald for 18 years and I have been aware of his love for this country since we first met,‚Äù the aspiring first lady told the convention. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs tough when he has to be, but he‚Äôs also kind and fair and caring.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald wants prosperity for all Americans,‚Äù she said, reading from a teleprompter, as people applauded.  Her roughly 15-minute speech was a bid to soften the image of the New York businessman-turned-politician, who has been accused of bigotry and callousness for his calls to suspend Muslim immigration and deport millions of undocumented immigrants if elected. He has also been criticized for insults directed at women, political opponents and journalists. Part of the text referring to the values held by her family was strikingly similar to a section of Michelle Obama‚Äôs speech to the Democratic convention in 2008. A Trump campaign official suggested the similarity was the result of an error by her speech writers. ‚ÄúIn writing her beautiful speech, Melania‚Äôs team of writers took notes on her life‚Äôs inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking,‚Äù Jason Miller, Trump‚Äôs senior communications advisor, said in a statement. Trump‚Äôs Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has accused Trump, 70, of lacking the experience and temperament needed to work in the Oval Office. On Monday, Clinton, 68, used an address to a largely black audience to cast Trump as someone who would divide the country along racial, ethnic and religious lines. The convention‚Äôs opening night featured a string of emotional speakers attacking Clinton‚Äôs record as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, many arguing she had made Americans vulnerable to Islamist militancy. ‚ÄúI blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son,‚Äù said Pat Smith, the mother of an information management officer who was among the four Americans killed in an attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose administration has been credited with sharply reducing crime in the city during the 1990s and who oversaw the city‚Äôs response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed almost 3,000 people, gave a highly charged speech slamming Clinton and making the case for Trump. ‚ÄúWhat I did for New York, Donald Trump will do for America!‚Äù he said. The convention erupted in chaos earlier when Trump opponents inside his party stormed out of the room and others chanted, in a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy. The turmoil threatened efforts by the Trump campaign to show the party had united behind him and distracted from the day‚Äôs theme of ‚ÄúMake America Safe Again‚Äù. The anti-Trump forces wanted to change the party‚Äôs nominating rules to allow delegates to support alternative Republican candidates over Trump. Party leaders held a voice vote, then declared the opponents lacked enough support, triggering pandemonium on the floor of the Cleveland basketball arena where Trump is due to be formally nominated this week for the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúThis entire system is rigged to force the vote for Donald Trump,‚Äù said Kendal Unruh, a delegate from Colorado. While delivering a jolt to the highly scripted program, the rebellion by the anti-Trump forces was quashed. But the furor, an embarrassment to Trump, put a spotlight on the deep divisions within the party that have emerged over his candidacy. A string of senior Republicans, worried about Trump‚Äôs temperament and policies, were already avoiding the convention.  The gathering opened on Monday afternoon in the shadow of racially tinged killings of police officers and black men, and as protesters for and against Trump faced off in a plaza a few blocks from the convention, shouting slogans at each other, separated by a wall of police. The protests were largely peaceful, with law enforcement officers outnumbering demonstrators.  Sunday‚Äôs shooting of three policemen in Baton Rouge, Louisiana - a targeted attack that may have been retaliation for a series of police killings of black Americans - hung over the gathering. Trump criticized Obama early on Monday over the shootings, saying the Democratic president ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have a clue.‚Äù   The Baton Rouge shootings happened nearly two weeks after police fatally shot a black man there, and after another such death near St. Paul, Minnesota, both of which sparked nationwide protests.  Five policemen were also killed in an ambush in Dallas this month. Trump has sought to position himself as the law-and-order candidate, in an echo of Republican Richard Nixon‚Äôs successful presidential campaign of 1968.

Virginia high court hears Republican voting-rights lawsuit,"RICHMOND, Virginia (Reuters) - In a case that could have an impact on the November presidential election, the Virginia Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday over a Republican lawsuit challenging the blanket restoration of voting rights for 206,000 felons by Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe. If upheld, McAuliffe‚Äôs order could help tip Virginia, a swing state where the vote is traditionally close in presidential elections, in favor of presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Lawyers for leaders in the Republican-controlled state legislature argued that McAuliffe exceeded his authority by restoring voting rights en masse, rather than on a case-by-case basis. ‚ÄúNever in Virginia‚Äôs 240-year history has a governor exercised clemency power en masse,‚Äù Charles Cooper, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the court. Cooper said history and the language of the state constitution clearly indicate that the restoration of a felon‚Äôs rights must be done individually. But Stuart Raphael, Virginia‚Äôs solicitor general, said nothing in the constitution restricts McAuliffe‚Äôs authority to restore such rights across the board, even though no governor has done so in the past. ‚ÄúIf he has the power,‚Äù Raphael said, ‚Äúhe has the power.‚Äù The plaintiffs have asked the court to block McAuliffe‚Äôs action, which also allows felons to serve on juries and hold public office. The court did not say on Tuesday when it may issue a decision in the case. Almost 12,000 felons have registered to vote since McAuliffe‚Äôs April 22 executive action, the state elections board said. Many of the convicts benefiting from the order are African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past. Democrat Barack Obama won Virginia in 2012 by about 150,000 votes and in 2008 by about 235,000 votes.  Before the order, felons had to petition the governor individually to restore their voting rights. Virginia is one of four states whose constitutions permanently disenfranchise felons but allow the governor to restore voting rights, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan civil liberties group. McAuliffe and other Democrats have said the restoration of rights to felons who have served their sentences and completed probation is long overdue. The McAuliffe administration has refused to release the names of felons whose rights have been restored, a decision that drew criticism on Tuesday from Justice William Mims. ‚ÄúI cannot understand why a document of such importance has been shielded from litigants and the citizens of Virginia,‚Äù he said.

Toxic algae and ice cream party keep top Republicans from Cleveland,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - As Republicans spilled into Cleveland on Monday to nominate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate, 2012 nominee Mitt Romney had an equally crucial task: Entertaining his grandchildren at his lakeside summer house in New Hampshire. U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican nominee who has endorsed Trump despite the latter‚Äôs insults, attended an ice cream party with his wife, Cindy, and volunteers in his re-election campaign in Prescott, Arizona. He also took part in a veterans‚Äô gathering. ‚ÄúWorking out of my office in Miami this week,‚Äù former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the Republican presidential race in February, said in an email to Reuters. Bush had been the most active in attacking Trump on the campaign trail and has said he will not be voting for either Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8. His brother, former President George W. Bush and father, former President George H.W. Bush, were also not at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. These are some of the big names from a long list of prominent Republicans who are not venturing this week to Cleveland, where Trump is to be formally nominated on Thursday after a rough-and-tumble Republican primary fight that ripped wounds in the party that have yet to heal. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told reporters the convention is a ‚Äúhealing time‚Äù for the party and that Republicans will leave Cleveland united, but he criticized Ohio Governor John Kasich for not participating in an event in his own backyard. And Republicans have moved past the Bush era, he added. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre part of the past. We‚Äôre dealing with the future,‚Äù he said. Kasich, a one-time rival of Trump‚Äôs for the nomination, is making the rounds in Cleveland without endorsing Trump or speaking at the convention, a snub that Manafort told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show is ‚Äúembarrassing the state‚Äù of Ohio. Kasich adviser John Weaver shot back: ‚ÄúGovernor Kasich has made it clear why he hasn‚Äôt endorsed Mr. Trump. They share a different world view in how to move the country forward.‚Äù Some of the party‚Äôs best diverse talent was missing from Cleveland or limiting their participation, including U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American, and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, an Indian-American. Many Republicans feel the party is in sore need of more Republicans like Rubio and Haley to appeal to a broader segment of the electorate. As Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gaveled the convention to order, Rubio was in Fort Myers, Florida, talking about how to tackle toxic algae polluting some of the state‚Äôs waterways. Rubio, who lost to Trump in the primary battle and is running for re-election to the U.S. Senate, is to deliver a short videotaped message to the convention on Wednesday. Haley is to speak at a breakfast for the South Carolina delegation in Cleveland on Wednesday. ‚ÄúChairman Reince Priebus asked if Governor Haley would speak at the convention a couple weeks ago. Governor Haley was grateful for the invitation and looks forward to attending the convention, but, as we have said before, she has no plans to speak so she declined the opportunity,‚Äù said her deputy chief of staff, Rob Godfrey. Romney, who has been a prominent voice among the anti-Trump forces, was in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, with 36 members of his family for their annual summer gathering, a spokeswoman said. Danny Diaz, who was campaign manager for Jeb Bush‚Äôs presidential campaign, said the convention is missing a chance to show off some of its most talented Republican politicians. ‚ÄúIt speaks to where we are as a party at the moment more than anything else,‚Äù he said.  Former Vice President Dick Cheney was in Wyoming helping the congressional campaign of his daughter, Liz Cheney, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was talked about as a possible vice presidential running mate for Trump, was at home in Palo Alto, California. ‚ÄúWriting her book about democracy!‚Äù said her chief of staff, Georgia Godfrey. Some of Trump‚Äôs former rivals for the nomination are speaking in Cleveland, like U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. But some of the others felled by Trump were doing other things. U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, an eye doctor, was providing free eye care in Paducah, Kentucky. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham was in his home state of South Carolina for the week. Republican strategist Ryan Williams said the no-shows are  evidence of a party still deeply fractured, despite the calls for unity. ‚ÄúIt shows that Trump has more work to do uniting the party and that he should continue to try to bring Republicans together even after the convention,‚Äù Williams said.

"Protesters face off in downtown Cleveland, separated by police","(Reuters) - Protesters for and against Trump faced off in a plaza a few blocks from the site of the Republican National Convention in downtown Cleveland on Monday, shouting slogans at each other but avoiding physical confrontation.  Dozens of protesters were separated by a wall of police that looked equal in number.  To one side of the police line at the foot of the Key Tower, Cleveland‚Äôs tallest building, demonstrators shouted, ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter.‚Äù From the other side came, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a bunch of anarchists.‚Äù The exchanges marked the first emotionally charged demonstration at the 2016 Republican National Convention, where security forces are on alert for potentially disruptive conflicts.  A combination of intense rhetoric by presumptive Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, recent police shootings of African- Americans in Baton Rouge and the Minneapolis area, and the killings of police in Dallas and Baton Rouge has raised tensions in the run-up to the convention.  Alicia Street, 31, a Black Lives Matter activist from Ferguson, Missouri, told Reuters that police appeared to outnumber the protesters. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need all these police. This is just free speech,‚Äù Street said shortly after a group of pro-Trump protesters left the area. ‚ÄúThey are going to make people afraid.‚Äù Smaller demonstrations were held elsewhere in the downtown area. At least two protesters were seen carrying firearms. A  group of people identifying themselves as ‚Äúanti-gay Christians‚Äù shouted at a rival group. One person carried a sign that read, ‚ÄúStop being a sinner and obey Jesus.‚Äù A speaker at an anti-Trump rally was arrested, but police said it was unrelated to the campaign. One protest leader, Kait McIntyre, 27, said organizers from her group had sought permission for weeks to march outside the protest zone and only recently received it from the city.  ‚ÄúWe wanted to get within sight and sound of the actual convention. We wanted our voices heard,‚Äù she said. ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 "
"U.S. TV networks, amid strong ad sales, boost coverage for Trump's convention","(Reuters) - U.S. TV networks, buoyed by strong demand from advertisers, are adding hours of coverage for this week‚Äôs Republican National Convention compared to four years ago and planning to use social media to capture any  unexpected moments, executives said. Presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump may be new to politics. But the former star of his own reality show ‚ÄúThe Apprentice‚Äù is a TV veteran who has promised to throw out the traditional convention script and provide a ‚Äúshowbiz‚Äù feel. Adding to the programing uncertainty are protests outside the convention hall in Cleveland and the possibility of dissent among delegates.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe to say that there are going to be surprises,‚Äù said Sam Feist, Washington bureau chief for CNN, the cable news network owned by Time Warner Inc (TWX.N).  ¬†¬†¬† The stakes are high for broadcast and cable networks. Media analysts predict viewership for Trump‚Äôs acceptance speech could surpass the record 38 million who watched Barack Obama address the Democratic convention in 2008. The potential for the unexpected at what is usually a meticulously staged event is driving strong advertiser demand, network executives said. CNN is pulling in between $40,000 and $100,000 for 30-second spots, a source familiar with the matter said. That is far above the typical cost of roughly $7,000 for a primetime ad on CNN. ‚ÄúWe are 100 percent sold on primetime and about 95 percent sold on other slots,‚Äù said Katrina Cukaj, executive vice president of portfolio sales and client partnerships at CNN parent Turner Broadcasting. She declined to comment on rates. Quick service restaurants and movie studios are running more spots than in past conventions, Cukaj said. ‚ÄúThe advertisers are a lot more diverse than I have ever seen,‚Äù Cukaj said. Broadcaster CBS (CBS.N) has seen strong ad sales for both conventions and has booked ads from the entertainment, packaged goods, travel and other industries, a network source said. In 2012, TV advertisers spent $5.8 million during both conventions, compared to $7.8 million in 2008, according to Kantar Media. Cable networks will provide coverage throughout each day and into the evening. Broadcast networks plan one hour of primetime coverage each of the four nights, plus online reports. In 2012, broadcasters aired an hour of only the last three nights. CNN will have hundreds of staff on the ground, more than any previous convention, Feist said. For the first time, the channel is anchoring every show from Cleveland through noon Friday. The network will face plenty of competition. Fox News Channel, owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), began its coverage from Cleveland on Thursday, four days before the start, compared to Sunday in years past. It also added staff outside to cover protests.  Trump‚Äôs acceptance speech could attract more than 40 million viewers, said Kyle Roberts, president and chief executive of Smart Media Group, a media buyer that works with Republican candidates. Some brands will avoid the convention, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a media buyer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just dangerous territory,‚Äù Lowenthal said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unpredictable content. I‚Äôm not sure that convention is going to enhance any brand‚Äôs image. Why go there if you can go elsewhere?‚Äù Media outlets say they will rely more heavily this year on social media and live streams. MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff said he expects to broadcast live most of the week. When not on television, he plans to be on Snapchat, Twitter and possibly Facebook Live. ‚ÄúThis is going to be a different kind of convention,‚Äù Soboroff said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt feel like business as usual because there is a lot of energy around that feels uncertain.‚Äù Walt Disney Co‚Äôs (DIS.N) ABC News will run up to six live streams simultaneously on its website and apps. Live coverage from CBS will appear on Twitter and the 24-hour CBSN mobile app. CBS is preparing for the possibility that Trump will appear in some role every night, another break from tradition, CBS News President David Rhodes said.

"For Islamophobia, take two of these and call a Muslim in the morning","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The normally straight-laced Council on American-Islamic Relations tried humor to win over Republicans at their national convention on Monday, handing out packets of a satirical medicine called ‚ÄúIslamophobin,‚Äù a treatment for Islamophobia. Islamophobin, which is really just chewing gum in a clever package, promises to treat ‚Äúblind intolerance, unthinking bigotry, irrational fear of Muslims, (and) U.S. presidential election year scapegoating.‚Äù On the first day of the Republican convention to nominate Donald Trump for the Nov. 8 election, CAIR leaders urged the party not to push Muslims voters away. Trump has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. He opposes letting in refugees from the Syrian war, suggesting some may be militants posing as the downtrodden. He has made claims, unsupported to date, that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey openly cheered the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In an interview broadcast Monday on CNN, Trump‚Äôs wife Melania, due to speak at the convention later in the day, said of her husband: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not racist, he‚Äôs not anti-immigrant,‚Äù and added, ‚ÄúHe wants to keep America safe.‚Äù CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad urged Republicans instead to court Muslims voters, saying they could be crucial in swing states that decide presidential elections. ‚ÄúToo often over the course of this campaign, Republican presidential candidates have pandered to these inner-core Islamophobic leaders and their supporters with proposals like patrolling so-called Muslim neighborhoods, surveilling and shutting down mosques, and openly questioning whether a Muslim can serve as president,‚Äù Awad said. As a prescription, Awad offered Islamophobin, a concept borrowed from Muslims in Sweden who created a similar product. CAIR sells a package of 12 sugar-free pieces for $1.99 on amazon.com.  The package says: ‚ÄúTake two and call a Muslim in the morning.‚Äù But it comes with a warning. ‚ÄúThose who already believe in religious diversity, tolerance and mutual understanding should not use this product,‚Äù the package says.  ‚ÄúStop taking this product if you begin to develop warm feelings toward Muslims, immigrants or refugees.‚Äù Nearby at a separate event, Christian demonstrators tried to eclipse a speech by Rose Hamid, a Muslim woman who was ejected from a Trump rally in South Carolina in January for her silent protest, by standing up wearing her head scarf and a T-shirt reading, ‚ÄúSalam, I come in peace.‚Äù As Hamid spoke in favor of a peaceful coexistence at a platform in Public Square set aside for scheduled speeches, the small group behind her hoisted signs such as one saying, ‚ÄúMuhammad is a liar, false-prophet, child-raping pervert.‚Äù When they tried to drown out Hamid with a bullhorn, she turned around to see them for the first time and remarked, ‚ÄúOh, they‚Äôre lovely.‚Äù Police then removed them from the scene for demonstrating without a permit.

Republican 2016 platform calls for reinstating 1933 banking law,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The U.S. Republican Party on Monday approved a new policy platform that calls for reinstating the 1933 Glass-Steagall law requiring the separation of commercial and investment banking, an addition White House hopeful Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign said it backed. Trump, who will formally accept the Republican presidential nomination in Cleveland this week, has vowed to dismantle most of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that was passed under President Barack Obama following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The language in the Republican platform offered further details on Trump‚Äôs regulatory policies. Trump, who has sought to cast himself as a populist, has accused presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of being too close to Wall Street. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the legislation that repealed Glass-Steagall in 1999. ‚ÄúThe Obama-Clinton years have passed legislation that has been favorable to the big banks, which is why you see all the Wall Street money going to her,‚Äù Paul Manafort, Trump‚Äôs campaign manager, told reporters on Monday. ‚ÄúThey know she‚Äôs their champion, and they are supporting her fully.‚Äù Some U.S. lawmakers in both parties support a modern Glass-Steagall to keep banks from becoming ‚Äútoo big to fail,‚Äù or so big their collapse would destabilize the financial system. The Democratic Party‚Äôs 2016 platform, which has not been approved, calls for an updated version.  Republicans universally despise Dodd-Frank, which their platform calls ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äô legislative Godzilla.‚Äù But senior congressional Republicans back other alternatives. ‚ÄúGlass-Steagall is dumb politics and dumb economics,‚Äù said Tony Fratto, who worked in the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. ‚ÄúReturning to Glass-Steagall would be destructive and unworkable.‚Äù Clinton has said she would break up banks based on risk, not size, and frequently focuses on the risks posed by non-bank institutions. Manafort listed the Glass-Steagall language among platform points he said ‚Äúreflect the issues that Mr. Trump has raised during the course of the campaign,‚Äù including building a wall at the border with Mexico and calling for tougher trade deals. The platform also calls for control of national parks and other lands to be handed over to states, an effort by the party‚Äôs conservative wing that got national attention during a 2014 standoff involving a Nevada cattle rancher.

Presidential candidate Clinton promises to prosecute police killers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton promised on Monday to bring the ‚Äúfull weight of the law‚Äù against people who kill police officers if she becomes the next U.S. president after two recent episodes of gunmen slaying police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate ahead of a Nov. 8 election, made the promise in a speech in Cincinnati at the annual convention of the civil rights group the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ‚ÄúAnyone who kills a police officer and anyone who helps must be held accountable,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúAs president, I will bring the full weight of the law to bear to make sure those who kill police officers are brought to justice.‚Äù  The penalties for killing a police officer are rightly more severe than those for killing a civilian because police are symbols of the rule of law, she said. Clinton‚Äôs remarks come among heighten tensions between police forces and many black and Latino Americans, who have been rallying in protests across the country against a spate of police killings of black men, often unarmed, during encounters. A black former soldier killed five police officers during one such protest in Dallas, Texas, on July 7. On Sunday, another black former U.S. Marine sergeant killed three police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 "
U.S. police deaths build momentum for law to treat attacks as hate crimes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the U.S. Congress returns in September from a summer recess, it is expected to consider legislation called the Blue Lives Matter Act that would make killing a police officer a hate crime, a step first taken by Louisiana earlier this year.  Debate in Louisiana over the law enacted in May pitted police unions, which supported tougher hate-crime sentences for police assailants, against civil rights groups, which felt police did not face the historic discrimination hate-crime laws were intended to address.  The Louisiana debate could play out on a national stage with the Blue Lives Matter Act as police shooting deaths this month in Dallas and Baton Rouge stoke momentum for action to combat violence against police and build support for the law.  ‚ÄúSince the Baton Rouge tragedy, we‚Äôve received calls and messages from around the country from individuals asking about the Blue Lives Matter Act, and we‚Äôre confident more members of Congress will be co-sponsoring the legislation as soon as they can when Congress reconvenes,‚Äù said Kyle Huwa, a spokesman for the bill‚Äôs author, Colorado Republican Representative Ken Buck.  Sixteen Republicans in the House of Representatives are co-sponsoring the bill, which was introduced in March and has failed to gain Democratic support. Its title plays off the Black Lives Matter movement that arose in protest against police use of force against minorities, especially black men, and deaths of minorities at the hands of police in recent years.  Fraternal Order of Police Executive Director Jim Pasco said he has in private meetings urged President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Loretta Lynch to protect police under the federal hate crime statute.  That law covers violence motivated by bias against a victim‚Äôs race, gender, national origin, religion or sexual orientation and imposes harsher penalties as a deterrent. But Pasco said he received no confirmation such a move would be supported by the administration. The Justice Department and the White House declined to comment on their positions.  In the shooting deaths of three police officers in Baton Rouge on Sunday, Louisiana prosecutors would have been able to seek hate crime penalties against gunman Gavin Long if he had survived. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers‚Äô Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a Washington based advocacy group, said many states have increased penalties for assaults against police and police deaths have been declining. Police shootings overall have been down in recent years. Preliminary Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics released Monday show 41 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2015. That was down almost 20 percent from 51 officers killed in 2014. ‚ÄúWe should not use this as a moment to dilute the unique problem of long standing discrimination and violence directed toward groups on the basis of race in our country,‚Äù Clarke said.

Obama administration asks Supreme Court to rehear immigration case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a last-ditch effort to revive a White House plan to protect up to 4 million immigrants from deportation, the Obama administration on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rehear a case on which the eight-member court was split 4-4 last month. The June 23 high court decision left in place a lower court ruling that blocked the plan, which has never been in effect. The court is currently one justice short following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. In a filing, the Justice Department asked the court to take a second look at the case once it has a full complement of nine justices. It is unclear when that would be, as the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate has declined to act on Obama‚Äôs nominee, appeals court judge Merrick Garland. As such, even if the Supreme Court was to grant the request, it is unlikely to rule on the case until well after Obama leaves office in January. Acknowledging that the high court rarely rehears cases, Acting Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn said the immigration case is unique because the court could not in future take another case to resolve the issue if the plan is blocked. The high court ‚Äúshould be the final arbiter of these matters through a definitive ruling,‚Äù he wrote. Obama unveiled his plan in November 2014. It was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued that Obama overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress. ‚ÄúBecause we are right on the law, we have prevailed at every stage in this case, and we are confident that we will continue to prevail,‚Äù said Marc Rylander, a spokesman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.  As a result of the high court‚Äôs 4-4 split, a 2015 lower-court ruling invalidating Obama‚Äôs plan was left in place. The plan never was implemented because the lower courts had blocked it. The plan was tailored to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. Obama took the action after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives killed bipartisan immigration legislation that was passed by the Senate in 2013. ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 "
Republican convention in turmoil as anti-Trump delegates protest,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The Republican National Convention was in an uproar on Monday after opponents of presumptive U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump failed in their effort to hold a roll-call vote in opposition to his candidacy. The anti-Trump forces at the Cleveland convention started shouting ‚ÄúRoll Call‚Äù after the party leaders approved by acclamation rules at the start of the convention that barred them from registering their opposition. Party leaders declared there was insufficient support to allow for a roll-call vote that would record the number of delegates opposed to Trump, a New York businessman who has never held political office and has struggled to win over many mainstream Republicans. Some delegates walked out of the convention in protest at the leaders‚Äô ruling while others chanted loudly, demanding a roll-call vote take place.

"After Brexit, Kerry pays tribute to EU achievements","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry paid tribute to the European Union on Monday as it tries to heal the wound of Britain‚Äôs vote to leave, saying detractors were overlooking what it had achieved in alliance with America. ‚ÄúI ask anyone who questions the importance of the EU or its relationship with the United States, (to consider) not just the history that I articulated, but the increase of prosperity, the rise in the standard of living ... the better protection of rights for individuals in the EU, as a consequence of what we have done together,‚Äù Kerry said in Brussels. He was speaking at a joint news conference with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini after a meeting with his European counterparts including Boris Johnson, Britain‚Äôs new foreign minister, who led the Leave campaign. His comments sounded like a jab at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who last month forecast the break-up of the EU due to fears over immigration, and at Johnson, who during the campaign compared the EU‚Äôs ambitions with those of Hitler and Napoleon. Kerry, a Democrat, spoke of the close ties between the United States and European Union dating back to the U.S. role in freeing Europe from Nazism in World War Two. But he acknowledged that such memories were fading.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a whole separation of time which has changed attitudes of some people,‚Äù he said, adding that in the face of common threats such as Islamist militancy, the EU-U.S. partnership was ‚Äúas important as it has ever been‚Äù. Mogherini responded that it sometimes took a clear-sighted transatlantic view to put Europe‚Äôs value into perspective. ‚ÄúI would like to thank you personally, and through you the U.S. administration of President Obama for the strong message and clear message that we always hear from you on the need for a strong and united Europe,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúSometimes we need our closest friends, our best friends, to remind us of the extraordinary value of the European Union.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 "

U.S. shootings heighten security concerns at Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Cleveland‚Äôs police union called for the suspension of a state law allowing people to carry firearms during the Republican National Convention but Ohio‚Äôs governor said he was powerless to act despite heightened security concerns with the killing on Sunday of three police officers in Louisiana.  Republican Donald Trump seized on the shooting deaths in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to bolster his case the United States is leaderless and he is the better candidate in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election to restore law and order than his rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was not immediately clear there was a link between Sunday‚Äôs shootings and recent unrest countrywide over police killings of black men, one of them a shooting in Baton Rouge about two weeks ago. Despite a lack of clarity about the motive and specifics of Sunday‚Äôs incident, Trump said President Barack Obama ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have a clue‚Äù on how to handle the problem after Obama voiced concern about inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trail.  ‚ÄúOur country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!‚Äù Trump said. He issued statements on Twitter on Sunday, a day before the start of the four-day Republican Convention in Cleveland this week due to formally nominate him for the White House. After the shootings in Baton Rouge, in which three other police officers were wounded, the head of Cleveland‚Äôs police union, Steve Loomis, asked Governor John Kasich to suspend state laws allowing people to openly carry firearms, but Kasich said he lacked the authority to do so. Kasich, a Republican who lost his bid for the White House to Trump, issued a statement through his spokeswoman Emmalee Kalmbach, saying: ‚ÄúOhio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested. The bonds between our communities and police must be reset and rebuilt - as we‚Äôre doing in Ohio - so our communities and officers can both be safe.‚Äù Clinton called the shootings ‚Äúdevastating‚Äù and urged the country to work together. ‚ÄúWe must not turn our backs on each other. We must not be indifferent to each other,‚Äù Clinton said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe must all stand together to reject violence and strengthen our communities.‚Äù Speaking at the White House, Obama said that with this week‚Äôs Republican convention followed next week by the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, political rhetoric would likely be more overheated than usual. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need inflammatory rhetoric, we don‚Äôt need careless accusations thrown around to score political points or to advance an agenda. We need to temper our words and open our hearts, all of us,‚Äù Obama told reporters. There were no plans to delay Monday‚Äôs start of the Cleveland convention, where thousands of Republican delegates are gathering amid a threat of protests both for and against Trump, 70, a businessman-turned-candidate. Security was extraordinarily tight with downtown streets lined by concrete traffic dividers and tall metal fences, propelled by a new urgency after an attacker drove his truck into a holiday crowd in Nice, France, last week, killing 84 people. Jeff Larson, chief executive officer of the convention, said he was not worried about the open carry law. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be plenty of law enforcement in downtown Cleveland,‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúI feel good about the security and what we‚Äôve done.‚Äù Trump sought to link the violence to the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, writing: ‚ÄúWe are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching.‚Äù Trump enters the crucial week trailing Clinton in most national opinion polls and needs a bounce from the convention to vault him into a more competitive position. Republican strategist Hogan Gidley said the violence gave relevance to Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that Donald Trump and his crowd were already prepared to talk about,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is an epidemic in this country now and we‚Äôve got to solve it.‚Äù Democratic strategist David Axelrod tweeted that Trump‚Äôs effort to make himself a law-and-order candidate reminded him of a similar attempt by Richard Nixon in 1968, when the Republican won his first presidential election. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs been studying ‚Äò68,‚Äù Axelrod tweeted. Trump‚Äôs goal at the convention is to get more American voters to take a fresh look at him and, he hopes, to see him in a more favorable light, after his victory over 16 other Republican candidates in a brutal battle marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric that left many in the party divided. To that end, many speakers will talk about their views on Trump, from daughter Ivanka to women‚Äôs pro golfer Natalie Gulbis.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs going to be a very personal convention. I mean, you‚Äôre going to have his family speaking. You‚Äôre going to have friends who have known him speaking,‚Äù Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù Many longtime party fixtures are staying away. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has been a private counselor to Trump, said the convention would help Trump pivot to the general election. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs never run for anything before. ... I think it‚Äôs just taken longer to pivot, and I think he‚Äôs pivoting,‚Äù Priebus told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press.‚Äù  The convention will also provide Republican faithful with their first look at his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who was announced on Saturday after a messy selection process. Hoping to win over more traditional Republicans, Trump picked the social conservative Pence over two other finalists, former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The disorganized nature of the running mate rollout - in which Trump failed to fully project the power of the partnership  - had some Republicans worried that they could see more of the same at Cleveland.

Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump, who often says he only likes winners, tells one grand tale of loss: In 1990, he nearly went bankrupt and was forced to ask dozens of banks to whom he owed money to change the terms on their loans and forgive some of his debts. It was, the real estate developer admits in his 1997 book ‚ÄúThe Art of the Comeback,‚Äù the darkest period of his professional life. In his telling, it‚Äôs a story of redemption, of resilience, and proof of his exceptional negotiating skills and shrewd thinking. Six people who participated in the loan workout negotiations have a different recollection, raising questions about a key part of the personal narrative that many of Trump‚Äôs supporters have found compelling as he campaigns to be the next president of the United States on Nov. 8. On the campaign trail he has portrayed himself as a survivor and a master negotiator. Trump says his comeback began when he recognized a downturn in the real estate market and quickly asked banks to renegotiate his loans. ‚ÄúThat decision was perhaps the smartest thing I did,‚Äù he wrote. The six bankers and lawyers involved in the talks say the bailout wasn‚Äôt based on any overture Trump initiated with the banks - and the terms of the deal were dictated by what was best for the banks, not Trump.  Three of the participants say Trump didn‚Äôt acknowledge he had a problem until his lenders reviewed his books, realized he was on the brink of collapse, and summoned him for debt restructuring talks.  While much has been written about Trump‚Äôs financial troubles at the time, there has been little examination of his description of the bank negotiations in ‚ÄúThe Art of the Comeback,‚Äù including his assertion that he chose to initiate those talks. Trump‚Äôs spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, declined to comment for this story. Following the U.S. stock market crash of 1987, a global recession hit New York real estate. New construction stalled, and several big developers declared bankruptcy.  As the real estate market slumped, Trump ran out of cash. At the beginning of 1990 he owed a combined $4 billion to¬†more than 70 banks, with $800 million personally guaranteed by his own assets, according to Alan Pomerantz, a lawyer whose team led negotiations between Trump and 72 banks to restructure Trump‚Äôs loans. Pomerantz was hired by Citibank but became lead counsel for the negotiations. At the time, Trump was not considered a major developer, but he was a New York celebrity. His affair with the actress Marla Maples and his divorce from his first wife Ivana Trump made national news headlines, and his first book, ‚ÄúThe Art of the Deal,‚Äù was a bestseller. He didn‚Äôt have a large portfolio of real estate in New York, with the notable exceptions of his 5th Avenue building, Trump Tower, completed in¬†1983, and the Plaza¬†Hotel, which he bought in 1988 after borrowing heavily from Citibank. He also owned three casinos in Atlantic City, having made a financial bet that he could revive the East Coast gambling destination. And in 1989 he¬†added part of an airline to his portfolio, again turning to Citibank for a loan to help finance the acquisition of bankrupt¬†Eastern Airlines Shuttle. He turned it into Trump Shuttle. In 1989, in response to growing concerns about the economic downturn,¬†the Federal Reserve began asking big banks to review their exposure to the sinking real estate market. At the beginning of 1990, a credit specialist at one of Trump‚Äôs biggest lenders decided to take a look at the bank‚Äôs book of loans to him. The decision was prompted in part by the Fed‚Äôs questions, as well as concerns within the bank about its exposure to the real estate market. The credit specialist,¬†who did not want to be identified, concluded at the time that Trump was ‚Äúabout to go into bankruptcy.‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúThe banks were onto the problem before he was onto the problem,‚Äù the specialist told Reuters. Pomerantz said some of the banks became aware of the magnitude of Trump‚Äôs financial problems when, on a single day, he drew down every cent of a $100 million line of credit one of the banks, Banker‚Äôs Trust, which was purchased by Deutsche Bank in 1999, had given him to meet his obligations. Reuters was unable to independently confirm this. ‚ÄúHe did not come to the banks and say ‚ÄòI have a problem.‚Äô That did not happen,‚Äù said Pomerantz. Pomerantz, who says he is not a member of any political party, argued in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that Trump‚Äôs record in real estate was not a good way to measure whether or not he would be a good president.  In ‚ÄúThe Art of the Comeback,‚Äù Trump says he began loan workout talks in March 1990 when he informed his bankers he might miss a payment on his casino debts.  ‚ÄúIf I had waited just six months longer to renegotiate terms with the banks, I might have lost everything,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI would have had to stand in line with a whole bunch of other moguls who were trying to do the same thing.‚Äù Soon, in boardrooms of banks and law firms around Manhattan, Trump‚Äôs deputies and lawyers began a series of meetings with representatives of the 72 banks, which had billions in outstanding loans, according to Pomerantz. During the same period, Trump was separately renegotiating a series of loans on his Atlantic City casinos. One of the bankers involved in those negotiations, Ben Berzin, said Trump seemed unaware of the depths of his financial troubles even after the banks had stepped in.  ‚ÄúThere was a period during these negotiations when he was still spending money like a drunken sailor,‚Äù Berzin said, recalling the uproar among the bankers when, in a TV interview in the summer of 1991, Trump displayed a large diamond engagement ring he had given Maples. Media reports said the ring cost $250,000, and Pomerantz said the bankers complained about it to Trump in their next meeting. At one point, Trump invited¬†all of the bankers to a Broadway show that Maples had a role in, according¬†to Berzin and a banker who took part in the larger talks with the 72 banks.¬†Both said they believed Trump was trying to curry favor to¬†win better terms in the workouts. Berzin attended the show but the other banker did not. Trump described Berzin in ‚ÄúThe Art of the Comeback‚Äù as a ‚Äújerk‚Äù who would ‚Äúscream at people at the top of his lungs about nonsense.‚Äù Berzin said he was irritated by Trump‚Äôs characterization and denied ever raising his voice in a meeting. In his book, Trump says he told representatives of the 72 banks he would declare bankruptcy and ‚Äútie you guys up for years‚Äù in the proceedings unless they staked him $65 million to keep his businesses running until the real estate market recovered. He also wanted them to agree to defer all loan payments until that time.   ‚ÄúThe banks more than capitulated - they enthusiastically agreed to my proposal,‚Äù Trump wrote. The bankers and lawyers interviewed dispute this. Though it was true that a personal bankruptcy would have made it harder for the banks to collect what Trump owed them, he had little leverage in the talks, they said. He, too, would have been seriously hurt in a bankruptcy, especially since he had personally guaranteed so much of what he had borrowed. In Pomerantz‚Äôs analysis, he would have been able to hold on to little else beyond his home and his pension plan. During the 18-month process of negotiations and asset sales, Trump also asked for more time to develop his business ideas, like his plan to turn hotel rooms at the Plaza Hotel into condominiums, according to one of the bankers, who declined to be identified. That proposal was vetoed. While he did receive a $450,000-a-month allowance from the banks to keep his business operations going, it was structured and executed on the banks‚Äô terms, several of the negotiators said. The banks¬†decided they could recover more of the $4 billion they were collectively owed if they sold Trump‚Äôs holdings one by one, waiting until the market recovered, rather than taking possession of the assets, four participants in the talks said.  These individuals said the banks agreed to forgive Trump‚Äôs personal liabilities in exchange for his help in selling the properties. The proceeds of the sales would then be split among the banks. Trump agreed that the banks could take away all his personal property, including his beloved Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, if he failed to execute the agreement. ‚ÄúWe had to be sure he would pay attention,‚Äù Pomerantz said of the liens on Trump‚Äôs personal holdings.¬†‚ÄúWe would meet with him every¬†Friday morning. He was under very strict restrictions by the banks.‚Äù  Trump worked with the bankers to sell his assets, even when he disagreed about the timing of the sales, most notably when Citibank eventually sold The Plaza. The banks did not recover 100 percent of what they were owed and several lenders vowed never to work with Trump again. ",politicsNews,"July 17, 2016 "

Exclusive: U.S. curtails federal election observers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal election observers can only be sent to five states in this year‚Äôs U.S. presidential election, among the smallest deployments since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 to end racial discrimination at the ballot box. The plan, confirmed in a U.S. Department of Justice fact sheet seen by Reuters, reflects changes brought about by the Supreme Court‚Äôs 2013 decision to strike down parts of the Act, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. Voting rights advocates told Reuters they were concerned that the scaling-back of observers would make it harder to detect and counter efforts to intimidate or hinder voters, especially in southern states with a history of racial discrimination at the ballot box. The Supreme Court ruling undercut a key section of the Act that requires such states to obtain U.S. approval before changing election laws. The court struck down the formula used to determine which states were affected. By doing so, it ended the Justice Department‚Äôs ability to select voting areas it deemed at risk of racial discrimination and deploy observers there, the fact sheet said. Eleven mostly Southern states had been certified as needing federal observers by the department. Federal observers can still be sent to monitor elections but only when authorized by federal court rulings. Currently, courts have done so in five states:¬†Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, and New York, according to the Justice Department. A Justice Department spokesman¬†declined to comment on the fact sheet or say how many people will be deployed to monitor voting until closer to the Nov. 8 election pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton. In recent presidential elections, the Justice Department has sent more than 780 people to watch elections around the country. They were split into three categories. The Supreme Court ruling reduced that to two, according to the document. One category is Justice Department staff, who have no statutory authority to access polling sites but still monitor voting nationwide. They must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations. A second group are federal observers trained by the Office of Personnel Management with unfettered access to polling sites. They are only deployed by federal court order. A third group ‚Äî which the document said has been eliminated by the Supreme Court decision ‚Äî are federal observers deployed to jurisdictions that the attorney general selected based on¬†evidence of possible racial discrimination. They were also trained by the Office of Personnel Management and had full access to polling sites. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Friday the Justice Department‚Äôs ability to deploy election observers had been ‚Äúseverely curtailed‚Äù by the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision. Since Congress passed the 1965 Act, federal observers have gathered evidence of unlawful activity and prepared reports from polling sites that can be used as evidence in court. In the November 2004 presidential election, the last for which the Justice Department provided numbers of federal observers, about 840 federal observers and more than 250 department personnel were dispatched to polling sites in 86 jurisdictions in 25 states. ‚ÄúThe mix of tools has shifted,‚Äù said Justin Levitt, who oversees the Justice Department‚Äôs voting section. The department still has the ability to send in personnel and take legal action against election officials where necessary, he said in an interview. But Justice Department staff who monitor elections have significantly less authority than federal observers. At any point on Election Day, Justice Department staff can be denied entry to a voting area or asked to leave, unlike a federal observer. That could make it more difficult to gather evidence of voting problems and potentially make it harder to prosecute cases of suppression, say voting rights advocates. Suppression can take a number of forms, such as intimidating or misinforming voters, or denying them access to voting materials in their own language. Relying on Justice Department personnel to monitor elections is ‚Äúa far cry‚Äù from federal observers who are statutorily authorized to be inside the polling place, said Gerry Hebert, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based non-profit Campaign Legal Center. Hebert, a former senior Justice Department voting rights official, oversaw teams of federal observers in the U.S. South before leaving the department in 1994. Federal observer reports have been cited in court cases by groups alleging voter fraud. In Sandoval County, New Mexico, federal observer reports showed that Native-American voters had difficulty getting voting information in their native languages during the decade between 1994 and 2004, according to a 2011 court order in a case the United States brought against the county. Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union‚Äôs Voting Rights Project, said federal observers are especially needed this year because 17 states have tightened restrictions on voting since the last presidential election. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very disappointed by the decision of the Justice Department,‚Äù said Ho. The Supreme Court ruling did not mention the federal observer program specifically, ‚Äúso I don‚Äôt think this decision was inevitable,‚Äù he added. Anita Earls, the executive director of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice and a former senior official in the Justice Department‚Äôs voting section, said the guaranteed ability of federal observers to examine voter registration rolls and remain inside polling stations makes them more effective than Justice Department staff at catching voter suppression.

"A festival air, and unease, hang over pre-convention Cleveland","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - East 4th Street, emblematic of the new Cleveland as a once-downtrodden area turned trendy, is bustling ahead of the Republican National Convention. Outdoor diners on the cobblestone restaurant row enjoy a glorious summer afternoon while cable network MSNBC shoots its politically themed shows on the street.  Just ahead of the four-day convention that starts on Monday, a festival of commerce and smiling faces takes place a few steps from the so-called hard zone, delineated by a literal iron curtain that surrounds the sports arena where Donald Trump will be crowned the Republican presidential candidate. ‚ÄúTen years ago, this place was a dump. A wasteland,‚Äù said John Lusk, 70, a semiretired publisher of a newsletter. ‚ÄúA group of young, hardworking entrepreneurs came in and look what they did.‚Äù    The sunny celebration butts uncomfortably against a massive security operation that shows the other side of Cleveland‚Äôs big moment. City and U.S. officials are preparing for the worst, aware that tensions over race relations and police use of force, as well as reaction to Trump‚Äôs polarizing campaign, could result in violence on the streets. Clevelanders are also aware of the backdrop for their convention: the mass shooting in Orlando that killed 50 people in June, the sniper attack that killed five Dallas police this month, and the truck assault that killed 84 this week in Nice. On this same idyllic block just over a year ago, police in riot gear clashed with demonstrators reacting to the acquittal of police officer charged with manslaughter for firing 15 rounds into the car of an unarmed black man and woman, killing them both. More than 70 people were arrested, disturbing the al fresco dining experience on East 4th Street. Unrest also followed the fatal police shooting in 2014 of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, an African-American who had a toy gun, and the officer who shot him was not charged with a crime. Cleveland, a city of 390,000, has been revitalized in part by billions of dollars in infrastructure spending in recent years, but the black majority still lags behind. Black Lives Matter, the protest group formed after a series of police killings of African-Americans raised questions about justice in America, held a protest on Saturday in Public Square. It was entirely peaceful, with about 100 activists clapping to speeches. In between the civic protest and festival atmosphere, there are pockets of emptiness. Street closing and security cordons seem to have scared off customers at the Arcade, a late 1800s shopping mall that has been modernized. The ornate interior, illuminated by a skylight, is full of boutiques like Prosperity, which sells handcrafted art glass jewelry. Business is slow on a Saturday afternoon. ‚ÄúA lot of people are afraid to come downtown,‚Äù said Cat Zurchin, one of the artist/storeowners, from an empty shop.   ‚ÄúSome of these stores opened up just for the convention. Retail people have been excited, but we also have some anxiety. The Secret Service is everywhere.‚Äù Black SUVs have invaded the city center as the U.S. Secret Service has taken charge of security. Concrete median barriers and the tall, anti-scaling fence circumscribe the city into impenetrable sectors. A column of police ride through the city center on bicycles, a dozen more on horseback. Helicopters clatter overhead.  Cleveland police are trying to stay restrained, avoiding the militarized presence that has become common thanks to free war surplus equipment from the Pentagon. Even so, the city‚Äôs courts are preparing to process up to 1,000 arrestees per day, ready to stay open 20 hours a day.  Hospitals are bracing for the worst. The Cleveland Clinic, one of the largest hospitals in the country, will have 50 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel at the convention site and its entire staff on standby. If needed the hospital can take over an adjoining hotel and conference center, enabling it to handle 1,000 general trauma cases. The hospital is prepared to operate without reinforcements for 96 hours. ‚ÄúAll boots on the ground,‚Äù said Dr. Robert Willie, chief of medical operations.     Likewise, the Secret Service says it can handle the spotlight. ‚ÄúWe are prepared,‚Äù said Ronald Rowe, the agent in charge of the convention, ‚Äúand ready to welcome the world to Cleveland.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 17, 2016 "
Can Pence's vow not to sling mud survive a Trump campaign?,"(Reuters) - In 1990, during a close and bitter congressional race, Mike Pence came under attack for using campaign funds to pay for personal expenses, including his mortgage and credit card bills. The expenditures were not illegal at the time, but proved difficult to explain for a candidate who had railed about the outsized role of money in politics. Pence in turn blasted his opponent with attack ads, including one featuring a man in traditional Arab clothing who thanked Pence‚Äôs opponent in thickly accented English for policies that benefited Middle Eastern oil producers. The commercial was attacked by Arab-American groups, and the Indianapolis Star called it one of the two worst campaign commercials that year. Pence, who is now Indiana‚Äôs governor and was selected this week to be Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential running mate, lost his 1990 race, but what he regretted more than losing, he later said, was his decision to sling mud. In the 25 years since that loss, Pence‚Äôs political allies and enemies alike say he has steered clear of personal attacks. This could prove challenging when campaigning with Trump, who enthusiastically tears into his rivals.  Pence‚Äôs style is likely to cast him in a very different role from that of traditional vice presidential candidates, who often throw and take punches to allow presidential contenders to remain above the fray. In the case of Trump and Pence, said Indianapolis University Professor Laura Merrifield Albright, the roles are likely to be reversed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a different dynamic. It‚Äôs tough to imagine anyone out-trumping Trump,‚Äù she said, noting that he is ‚Äúwilling to do his own dirty work.‚Äù Michael Totten, a retired architect who worked on Pence‚Äôs 1990 campaign, thinks the two candidates will complement one another. He dubbed Pence ‚Äúthe perfect No. 2,‚Äù a running mate who can ‚Äútemper some of Trump‚Äôs enthusiasm‚Äù and ‚Äúbe the calming voice.‚Äù¬† Neither Pence nor the Trump campaign immediately responded to a request for comment. After losing his 1990 race, Pence apologized to his opponent for the oil advertisement.  He later told his colleague at a conservative think tank, William Styring, that he regretted the tone of the campaign. ‚ÄúI really screwed up on this. It‚Äôs not me,‚Äù Styring recalled Pence as saying.  In 1991, Pence wrote an apologetic article for the think tank‚Äôs policy journal, titled ‚ÄúConfessions of a Negative Campaigner.‚Äù After the defeat, Pence did not seek public office again for a decade. He worked at the Indiana Policy Review and hosted his own statewide conservative radio talk show, describing himself as ‚ÄúRush Limbaugh on decaf.‚Äù¬†He also hosted a morning TV show in Indianapolis from 1995 to 1999. In 2000, Pence again ran for a U.S. House of Representatives seat, this time successfully. And he demonstrated that his 1990 mea culpa was more than just political theater, observers of Indiana politics say. His opponents in campaigns after he re-entered politics describe him as extremely disciplined and cordial. Melina Fox, Pence‚Äôs Democratic challenger in 2002, said that his statements in the race were ‚Äúcalculated and thought-out.‚Äù Democrat Barry Welsh, who ran against him in 2006, 2008 and 2010, said Pence was invariably ‚Äúpolite, professional and gentlemanly.‚Äù  But some question how he will cope with being constantly challenged in a hard-fought presidential race. ‚ÄúHe seems uncomfortable with difficult questions and does not take counterpunches very well,‚Äù said Rebecca Pearcey, who ran the losing campaign of Pence‚Äôs opponent in the 2012 race for Indiana governor, Democrat John Gregg.¬†‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt engage. He operates as though the opponent is not there.‚Äù ¬† Before being picked as Trump‚Äôs running mate, Pence was poised for a tight rematch race against Gregg. In recent months, Pence‚Äôs approval rating had fallen below 50 percent, in part because of controversy surrounding the state‚Äôs Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which held that ‚Äúa governmental entity may not substantially burden a person‚Äôs exercise of religion.‚Äù Pence first alienated liberals and moderates by signing the bill into law. He then outraged the measure‚Äôs evangelical supporters by endorsing changes to the law aimed at preventing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The 2016 gubernatorial campaign had started to become more negative, with yard signs calling for Pence to be fired. The Republican Governors Association ran an independently produced ad that attacked his opponent‚Äôs record. But Pence himself had not gone negative. At a Saturday morning event to formally introduce his running mate, Trump called Pence ‚Äúa man of honor,‚Äù contrasting him with Hillary Clinton, whom he described as ‚Äúthe embodiment of corruption.‚Äù It remains to be seen how aggressive Pence will be in campaigning for Trump in coming months - and whether he will stick to the principles outlined in his 1991 article on negative campaigning. ‚ÄúIt is wrong, quite simply,‚Äù he wrote at the time, ‚Äúto squander a candidate‚Äôs priceless moment in history ... on partisan bickering.‚Äù  In an interview with CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl that will air on ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù on Sunday evening, Trump suggested he may not expect his running mate to go on the attack.   While discussing his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Trump told Stahl, ‚ÄúI call her ‚ÄòCrooked Hillary‚Äô ... but I don‚Äôt think he should do it, because it‚Äôs different for him.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 16, 2016 "
"In circuitous speech, Trump touts VP pick Pence as man to unify party","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump on Saturday presented his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, as the man who can unify a fractured Republican party and help him bridge the gap created by the candidate‚Äôs outsider status. In a wide-ranging speech in which he touted his own ‚Äúlandslide‚Äù victory in the Republican primaries, Trump cast Pence as a perfect complement for the White House: a veteran of government, a man with a Midwestern sensibility and strong Republican credentials as a job creator and budget balancer.   ‚ÄúIndiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice, I‚Äôve admired the work he‚Äôs done, especially in the state of Indiana,‚Äù Trump said at an event in New York City.  ‚ÄúAnd one of the reasons is party unity, so many people have said, party unity. Because I‚Äôm an outsider,‚Äù he added in explaining his decision. Trump and Pence made their debut just two days before the beginning of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where delegates from around the country will convene to officially nominate the pair as their party‚Äôs ticket for the Nov. 8 election. Frequently straying from the notes on the lectern, Trump talked about himself and likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, often detouring from the purpose of the event: to introduce a little-known politician to the broader public. ‚ÄúBack to Mike Pence,‚Äù Trump said, interrupting himself during a lengthy explanation about why evangelical voters support his candidacy. He then read a series of statistics highlighting the job growth in Indiana.     ‚ÄúHe looks very good,‚Äù added the New York real estate mogul, who is known to comment openly on people‚Äôs appearances.   Trump had a bit of a winding path to settle on Pence, a devout Christian and conservative. He postponed his planned Friday announcement after the deadly attack in Nice, France and saying he had not made his ‚Äúfinal, final decision,‚Äù Trump privately had second thoughts on who to pick in late-night conversations on Thursday, said a Republican source familiar with the situation. Trump had been annoyed that the element of surprise had been taken away by the leaking of Pence‚Äôs name, the source added. Trump ended up announcing Pence as his running mate on Twitter on Friday.  Saturday‚Äôs event in a New York City hotel ballroom had few of the traditional hallmarks of what is arguably one of the most important decisions for a presidential candidate. Before it started, supporters listened to the Rolling Stones song ‚ÄúYou Can‚Äôt Always Get What You Want,‚Äù a tune in regular rotation at Trump events. There were no ‚ÄúTrump Pence‚Äù signs distributed to the crowd or adorning the room. The two appeared together on stage only briefly - each standing out of view while the other one spoke.  On stage, they made scant eye contact and shook hands rather than raising arms together in the classic pose of running mates. Neither offered anecdotal stories about their private time together.       Pence, in sharp contrast to Trump, delivered a prepared speech, discussing the love of his wife and country and his adoration for Ronald Reagan. He gave a full-throated call to fellow Republicans to back Trump. ‚ÄúLets come together as a party, as a people, as a movement, to make America great again and that day begins when Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States of America,‚Äù Pence said. Trump has struggled to bridge the gap between himself and the establishment and conservative wings of the party. The drastically different styles highlighted Pence‚Äôs ability to provide a complementing tone to the presidential ticket.     It‚Äôs unclear when the two will appear together again. Pence heads back to Indiana for a solo event on Saturday night, and the Trump campaign hasn‚Äôt released a schedule for the convention that would include a joint appearance. The pair recorded an interview with CBS‚Äôs ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù that is scheduled to air on Sunday night.         One of their big challenges will be to brook their policy differences in public. Pence gave a nod to that by saying ‚Äústrong Republican leadership can bring about real change.‚Äù Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a central theme of his campaign, while Pence has spoken in favor of trade agreements. In an appearance on Friday night on Fox News, Pence offered a moderated take on trade, saying he agrees with Trump that deals should be renegotiated.  He also softened his vocal opposition to Trump‚Äôs call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.      ‚ÄúI am very supportive of Donald Trump‚Äôs call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States,‚Äù Pence told conservative Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. Pence added that he supports Trump‚Äôs call for building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. ",politicsNews,"July 16, 2016 "
A kiss is not just a kiss on Cleveland convention billboards,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - In an age of social media and sound bites, advocacy groups in Cleveland have turned to the old-fashioned medium of billboards to display messages during the Republican National Convention, from the serious to the ridiculous and shocking. Among them is an artist‚Äôs fanciful rendering of Donald Trump about to kiss former rival Ted Cruz, a poke at a Republican Party platform that would limit gay rights, the sign‚Äôs sponsor said.  ‚ÄúLove Trumps Hate. End Homophobia,‚Äù reads the billboard featuring Trump and Cruz moving in for a lip-lock.  Elsewhere in Cleveland, there are also chestnuts such as ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Trust the Liberal Media,‚Äù and the eternally contentious issue of abortion is the focus of another that says, ‚ÄúHow much time will we serve - when the RNC platform makes abortion illegal?‚Äù Some 50,000 visitors are expected in Cleveland for the convention that runs from Monday to Thursday. There Trump, who has selected Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate, is expected to officially accept the Republican nomination for president. With so many party insiders, activists, lobbyists and reporters descending on Cleveland, political groups have chosen a direct path to their eyeballs. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Trust the Liberal Media,‚Äù paid for by the Media Research Center, stands beside a highway near the airport and is repeated at least twice more in central Cleveland, where the convention will take place. Six strategically placed signs around the city depict a group of women in a police-style lineup. The message, sponsored by the National Institute of Reproductive Health, which supports abortion rights, is intended to bring attention to recently passed state laws seeking to limit access to abortion.  ‚ÄúWe wanted to use the RNC to raise awareness with the public. We wanted to give the public the facts about what is happening and the laws on the books being quietly passed behind the scenes and the logical conclusion that those laws will put women in jail,‚Äù said Andrea Miller, president of the institute. The Trump-Cruz makeout illustration resembles images of unstated political motives depicting Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that went up in Lithuania and another in Bristol, England, that showed Trump bussing British politician Boris Johnson.  The Cleveland sign was paid for by Planting Peace, a group favoring equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. ‚ÄúPlanting Peace calls for the immediate change in the Republican Party platform with regard to our LGBT family and LGBT rights,‚Äù said Aaron Jackson, president of the group.  The 2016 Republican platform includes a plank called ‚ÄúPreserving and Protecting Traditional Marriage‚Äù that calls for marriage to be defined as ‚Äúa union between one man and one woman.‚Äù  About half a mile (one km) east of the convention site is a fake advertisement for a company called ‚ÄúDick to Dick LLC‚Äù that ends with the line, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to live forever.

New urgency for Cleveland security after France truck attack,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Cleveland on Friday set up concrete traffic dividers and tall metal fences around next week‚Äôs Republican National Convention site, measures meant to thwart an attacker like one in France who drove a truck into a crowd, killing more than 80 people. Security experts said police, the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies have viewed vehicles as a potential threat since early in their 18 months of planning for the convention where Donald Trump is due to be formally nominated for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.  The decision to erect the protective barriers was taken before Thursday night‚Äôs attack in the French city of Nice. Ron Rowe, a high-ranking special agent with the Secret Service, told a news conference on Tuesday that some of the barriers would be going up that day.  Much of the focus has been on stopping a car or truck bomb like those that struck New York‚Äôs World Trade Center in 1993 and an Oklahoma City federal office building in 1995. ¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúA vehicle-borne attack is always something you‚Äôre concerned about,‚Äù said Jason Porter, vice president for the central region of security provider Pinkerton, which is advising private sector clients on security around the convention.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†Officials in Cleveland did not respond when asked whether the Nice attack had altered their security plans. The driver there, shot dead by police, was known to police for petty crimes but not for ties to Islamist militants. Thousands of people, including protesters against Trump, are expected to pack into Cleveland for the July 18-21 convention. Cleveland has banned drones, limited the size of bags people can carry and on Friday removed opaque rubbish bins near the Quicken Loans Arena convention site, replacing them with wire frames holding clear plastic waste bags that make it more difficult to hide objects. A memorial to slain police officers was cordoned off, an apparent reaction to protests against high-profile killings of black men and youth by police in U.S. cities including St. Paul, Minnesota, Baltimore, New York and Cleveland. After last week‚Äôs killing of five police officers in Dallas by an African American angry about police killings of black men, nearly half of America‚Äôs 30 biggest cities issued directives to pair up police officers on calls to boost safety, according to a Reuters survey of police departments. ¬†¬†¬† T.J. Dow, a Cleveland city councilman for the neighborhood expected to see the bulk of protests, said the security plan was designed to be flexible. Dorothy Strauss, a 68-year-old retired customer service representative, acknowledged her fears in the face of the France attack while watching her granddaughters play in a sprinkler near the convention site. Were she a delegate, she would attend, Strauss said. ‚ÄúOn the flip side, I wouldn‚Äôt come down here and hang out with my two granddaughters during the RNC.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 "
White House candidate Trump announces Pence as his running mate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs choice of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate on Friday helped bolster support among some conservatives skeptical about his policies, a crucial step as he prepares to accept the party‚Äôs nomination next week. Some conservatives who had fought against Trump‚Äôs ascendancy in the Republican nominating race welcomed his announcement that he had picked Pence, a well-known social and evangelical conservative. The Club for Growth, a conservative economic group, had sharply criticized Trump‚Äôs support for protectionist trade policies. On Friday, the group noted that as a member of the House of Representatives, Pence had been a strong voice for ‚Äúfree markets and economic liberty‚Äù at a time when the Republican leadership had been weak on these issues. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs news gives a similar hope that Mike Pence will be  effective in pulling the Republican ticket toward economic conservatism and limited government,‚Äù the group said. Other conservatives were also heartened by Trump‚Äôs VP pick, which the businessman announced in a tweet ahead of a joint appearance in his hometown of New York on Saturday. ‚ÄúPence is a principled conservative, man of faith, and talented messenger for Republican ideas,‚Äù said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ‚ÄúHis addition to the ticket will bring even more excitement to the voters who are eager to put a Republican in the White House and deny a third term for President Obama‚Äôs liberal agenda.‚Äù Trump, 70, chose Pence, 57, over two politicians he considers friends and close advisers, former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, 73, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 53. Pence is viewed as a safe choice for Trump. The Indiana governor‚Äôs low-key demeanor is a contrast to that of the bombastic real estate developer. And he could take the fight to the Democrats in the months leading up to the Nov. 8 election without upstaging Trump. He and Trump will have to smooth over some policy differences. Pence has said he does not support trade protectionism or a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, two policies that are central to Trump‚Äôs campaign message. In his first public remarks after Trump announced his running mate, Pence appeared to soften his opposition to a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country after he called it  ‚Äúoffensive and unconstitutional‚Äù in a tweet last December. ‚ÄúI am very supportive of Donald Trump‚Äôs call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States,‚Äù Pence told conservative Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. ‚ÄúWe have no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people,‚Äù Pence said, adding that he suspended a Syrian refugee program in Indiana after a shooting rampage last year in San Bernardino, California.  Pence also said he ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù backed Trump‚Äôs promise to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to stem illegal immigration and make Mexico pay for it. Trump said Pence had done a great job in Indiana and that of all the people he had interviewed for the job, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nobody that agrees with me fully on everything.‚Äù Pence‚Äôs selection was slammed by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. ‚ÄúBy picking Mike Pence as his running mate, Donald Trump has doubled down on some of his most disturbing beliefs by choosing an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families,‚Äù said Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. Trump had faced a midday Friday deadline to announce Pence because the governor had to declare by then whether he would be on the ballot in his home state for re-election. Trump had postponed his announcement, which had been planned for Friday, out of respect for the victims in Nice, France. An attacker in a heavy truck drove into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing at least 84 people and injuring scores more in what President Francois Hollande called a terrorist act. Trump is set to be formally nominated as the party‚Äôs candidate for the presidential election at the convention, which opens in Cleveland on Monday. Traditionally, the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists. The Republican National Committee expects the convention to draw 50,000 people to the Ohio city, whose population is about 390,000. U.S. authorities were preparing for the possibility of violence, whether from demonstrators or planned attacks. The Cleveland conclave and the Democratic Party Convention the following week in Philadelphia have been given the status of special national security event by the federal government for the first time, and security will be heightened, said Republican Party spokesman Sean Spicer. The Department of Homeland Security will send more than 3,000 personnel to each convention, Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Thursday, speaking before the Nice attack. No specific or credible threat to either gathering has been reported, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 "
"Fund-raising stalled, Republican convention asks Adelson for donation","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A handful of donors to the Republican National Convention have withdrawn pledges and fund-raising has stalled during Donald Trump‚Äôs polarizing bid for the presidency, leading organizers to ask casino mogul Sheldon Adelson for an urgent donation. The Cleveland 2016 Host Committee said in a statement on Friday it had approached Adelson, a generous party benefactor, while also acknowledging its fund-raising has come to a virtual standstill, leaving a $6 million shortfall. ‚ÄúNegative publicity around our potential nominee resulted in a considerable number of pledges backing out from their commitments,‚Äù the Host Committee said in a letter it sent to Adelson, according to the political news website Politico, which said it had obtained the letter. The Host Committee on Friday confirmed such a letter was sent to Adelson and his wife, Miriam Adelson, but it downgraded the withdrawn pledges from ‚Äúconsiderable‚Äù to ‚Äúa handful.‚Äù It said the hastily sent original letter ‚Äúmischaracterized‚Äù the status of some donations. Some companies identified in the letter as having backed out said on Friday they had never made such pledges. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, this letter (to Adelson) was not reviewed nor authorized by the Host Committee chairpersons, and it mischaracterized certain donations from individuals and corporations,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúSome of what were referred to as pledges were actually expectations based on pledges made to previous conventions, while a handful had been withdrawn from the Host Committee for 2016 Republican National Convention,‚Äù it said. The committee said it had apologized to the Adelsons‚Äô staff. Host Committee officials on Friday declined to comment beyond the official statement, leaving open the question of which donors reneged. Donations will be disclosed after the convention in U.S. Federal Election Commission filings. The statement, from Host Committee Chief Executive David Gilbert, also said the committee had raised $58.25 million to date, about $6 million short of its goal of $64 million to cover expenses for the four-day convention that starts Monday in Cleveland, where Trump is expected to receive the Republican presidential nomination. A month ago, a committee spokeswoman said $57.5 million had been raised. The Politico report, citing the letter, said David Koch, like Adelson a wealthy donor to conservative causes, and Coca-Cola (COKE.O) each withdrew a pledge of $1 million. Koch and Coke representatives told the Wall Street Journal they never made such pledges. Coke previously said it donated $75,000 last year. Visa, cited in the letter as having backed out of a $100,000 pledge, said in a statement it never made a pledge.     FedEx (FDX.N) and BP (BP.L) were named in the letter as withdrawing support but also told the Journal they had not made the stated commitments. Other marquee companies were also named but did not respond to Reuters queries after business hours on Friday. Representatives for the Adelsons could not immediately be reached for comment. Last month activists disturbed by Trump‚Äôs campaign and led by the political arm of California-based advocacy group Color of Change launched an effort to try to shame companies into dropping sponsorships. It was unclear if that effort, which targeted more than 30 companies, had an impact. ",politicsNews,"July 16, 2016 "
Changes to North Carolina voting laws could put thousands of 2016 ballots at risk,"RALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) - On Election Day in 2014, Joetta Teal went to work at a polling station in Lumberton, North Carolina. Like all poll workers, she was required to stay until voting booths closed, so she decided to cast her own vote there. That was a mistake, she later discovered. What she didn‚Äôt know was that under a 2013 state law she had to vote in the precinct where she lived. The polling station where she voted was not in her precinct, so her vote was not counted. ¬†¬†¬† A Reuters review of Republican-backed changes to North Carolina‚Äôs voting rules indicates as many as 29,000 votes might not be counted in this year‚Äôs Nov. 8 presidential election if a federal appeals court upholds the 2013 law. Besides banning voters from voting outside their assigned precinct on Election Day, the law also prevents them from registering the same day they vote during the early voting period.  The U.S. Justice Department says the law was designed to disproportionately affect minority groups, who are more likely to vote out of precinct and use same-day registration. Backers of the law deny this and say it will prevent voter fraud. The battleground state has a recent history of close races that have hinged on just a few thousand votes.¬†Barack Obama, a Democrat, won North Carolina by just 14,177 votes in 2008. In 2012, Mitt Romney, a Republican, narrowly carried the state by a margin of just 2.04 percent. ¬†¬†¬† Reuters reviewed state election board data showing the number of North Carolinians who made use of out-of-precinct voting and same-day registration in previous elections, including March‚Äôs state nominating contest, or primary, when voters nominated their preferred presidential candidate.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†The Reuters analysis includes some assumptions. For 29,000 votes to go uncounted on Nov. 8, North Carolinians would need to vote in the same numbers and in the same ways they have in previous elections, including the March primary.   In that primary, after a court temporarily ordered a stay on  the bans, 6,387 North Carolinians voted out of their assigned precinct and 22,501 registered the same day they voted.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†The North Carolina Board of Elections did not respond to requests for comment on Reuters‚Äô findings.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†North Carolina Senator Bob Rucho, a Republican who backed the law, declined to comment specifically on the findings but disputed the notion that the law suppressed votes, saying the increased turnout between the 2010 and 2014 elections shows it has not had a disparate impact on minority voters. ‚ÄúHow can it show voter suppression when more black voters voted and more white voters voted, and there was more opportunity, and there are more black voters registered than there were before?‚Äù  ¬†¬†¬†¬†Turnout between those elections did rise by 1.8 percentage points for black voters and by 1.1 percentage points for white voters, according to data the state election board entered as evidence in court. ¬† Advocacy group Democracy North Carolina, however, said their poll monitors saw many people attempting to vote out of precinct in 2014 who were told by officials their ballots would not count, and as a result cast no vote. And it¬†says 23,500 voters would have used same-day registration to vote in 2014 if it had not been banned, basing its findings on a review of election board data, hundreds of hotline calls, and the observations of more than 300 poll monitors. ¬† North Carolina Board of Elections executive director Kim Strach said her office looked into claims of voters being turned away ‚Äúbut generally did not find statewide evidence of it.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬† The Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considering legal challenges to the law from the Justice Department and civil rights groups and citizens, is expected to issue a ruling in the next few weeks. North Carolina‚Äôs Senate passed its new voting laws weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 in June 2013 to eliminate a requirement that nine states mostly in the South with a history of discrimination, including North Carolina, receive federal approval before changing election laws. Had that requirement been in place, ‚Äúit may have blocked the provisions now at issue,‚Äù said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers‚Äô Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a non-profit legal defense fund. The Justice Department alleged a ‚Äúrace-based purpose‚Äù to the new law in a legal brief. Studies the department cited show that minority and low-income voters are more likely to use same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting because they are less likely to own a car or have flexible working hours. These voters are also more likely to vote for Democratic candidates.  ‚ÄúIf you pick out precisely the way minority voters are engaging with the process, that‚Äôs intentionally treating minority voters differently,‚Äù Justin Levitt, who oversees the Justice Department‚Äôs voting unit, said in an interview.  ¬†¬†¬† North Carolina state officials say the changes cut fraud by making it harder for people to cast multiple ballots or impersonate other voters. ¬†The Justice Department said in court documents that voter fraud was ‚Äúvirtually non-existent‚Äù in the state. Rucho, the state senator, said while the law banned some voting methods and cut the early voting period from 17 to 10 days, it extended the hours during which voters could vote. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúWe opened up more locations for them to vote, more times to vote, more flexible times,‚Äù said Rucho. FOUR-PERSON TEAM    Teal, who is African American, was one of 14 North Carolina voters Reuters contacted whose votes were invalid in 2014 because of the law. ¬†¬†¬† Ten of them, including Teal, did not realize their votes were not counted until informed by Reuters. One was told his vote would not count by a voter advocacy group, and the other three were told by poll workers that their ballots likely would not count. In all, 1,390 ballots were rejected in the 2014 election because they were cast out of the voter‚Äôs assigned precinct ‚Äî up from 49 rejected for the same reason in 2010, according to¬†the Reuters review of provisional ballots. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúIf they could have just sent people letters and told them exactly where to go, that would have been helpful,‚Äù Teal said. The North Carolina Board of Elections website has a tool for residents to look up their assigned precincts, but Teal did not know about it. This year she plans to vote early. In other developed democracies, ‚Äúthe government takes a greater responsibility for ensuring that voter registration lists are kept up to date and accurate,‚Äù said Tova Wang, senior fellow at the policy research group Demos. ¬†¬†¬†¬†The election board has been trying to educate North Carolinians about the ban on out-of-precinct voting through ads and a four-person voter outreach team that travels around the state to raise awareness about the changes, said Strach, the board‚Äôs director.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôre telling people, go find out where you are, make sure you‚Äôre showing up at the right precinct,‚Äù Strach said.

Clinton leads Trump by 12 points ahead of Republican convention: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump trailed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 12 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, making him the clear underdog ahead of next week‚Äôs Republican National Convention. Forty-five percent of likely voters supported former Secretary of State Clinton, 33 percent supported Trump, the wealthy businessman, and the remainder supported neither, according to the July 11-15 online poll. The survey showed little change from Tuesday, when Clinton had led Trump by 13 percentage points. Clinton has been ahead in the poll since early January. Trump only approached her level of support in May, after his last two remaining rivals quit the race and he became the presumptive Republican nominee. Trump‚Äôs favorability has dropped since then, as his campaign began to focus on the Nov. 8 general election. Trump has faced criticism in recent weeks over his now-defunct Trump University venture, which is accused of making false promises, and over his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric. The poll results were mostly gathered before Thursday night‚Äôs deadly truck attack in Nice, France, and before Trump‚Äôs announcement on Friday that Indiana Governor Mike Pence would be his vice presidential running mate. The poll results suggest that Clinton‚Äôs use of personal email for government business while secretary of state and her handling of classified information have not damaged her support among likely voters.  But other polls show a closer race.  The CBS News/NY Times telephone poll has the candidates tied at 40 percent each, while a McClatchy/Marist telephone poll has Clinton leading by just 3 percentage points, 42 percent to Trump‚Äôs 39 percent.  Trump may get a bump in the polls following next week‚Äôs convention in Cleveland, where the party is expected to rally behind him as the nominee. In 2012, support for Republican nominee Mitt Romney rose about 5 percentage points following the convention that year.  The Democratic convention is set for the following week, opening July 25 in Philadelphia. The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 1,186 likely voters across the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 "
Pages of U.S. 9/11 report detailing possible Saudi ties made public,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Friday released a long-classified section of the official report on the Sept. 11 attacks describing an array of potential links between some of the hijackers and officials in Saudi Arabia. The 28 pages of the report on the 2002 investigation focus on potential Saudi government ties to the 2001 aircraft attacks on the United States, in which nearly 3,000 people died. The report said the alleged links had not been independently verified. The pages were released by the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee after years of wrangling in Washington between Congress and different administrations, Republicans and Democrats, and urging by families of those killed. ‚ÄúThe matter is now finished,‚Äù Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference in Washington. Asked whether the report exonerated the kingdom, he replied: ‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù The release of the previously classified pages is unlikely to end the controversy over the role of Saudi Arabia, an important U.S. partner in the Middle East. Many U.S. officials who opposed their release had worried they would damage diplomatic relations. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi citizens. ‚ÄúAccording to various FBI documents and CIA memorandum, some of the September 11 hijackers, while in the United States, apparently had contacts with individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government,‚Äù the report said, giving a catalog of alleged links. They included reported contacts between Saudis in California, money possibly sent from the Saudi royal family to the hijackers and even a statement that a reported Saudi Interior Ministry official stayed at the same Virginia hotel as one hijacker in September 2001. One section said Omar al-Bayoumi, said to be a Saudi intelligence officer, met with two hijackers at a public place after they arrived in San Diego. Citing Federal Bureau of Investigation files, it said his salary rose to $3,700 a month from $465 two months after two of the hijackers arrived in California. Another described how two of the hijackers asked flight attendants technical questions during a trip in 1999 from Phoenix to Washington to attend a party at the Saudi embassy. One tried twice to enter the cockpit. The plane made an emergency landing and the FBI investigated, but did not prosecute. The newly declassified pages also say a telephone number found in a telephone book of Abu Zubaydah, a Saudi-born al Qaeda operative captured in Pakistan, was for a Colorado corporation that managed the affairs of the residence of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the former Saudi ambassador to Washington.  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said its agreement to the release is not an indication that the intelligence community agrees with the pages‚Äô accuracy or concurs with the information it contains. The office also on Friday released a declassified summary of an assessment of whether Riyadh may have supported al Qaeda before and after the attacks, saying the Saudi government and many of its agencies had been infiltrated and exploited by individuals associated with or sympathetic to Osama bin Laden‚Äôs militant network. Several members of Congress said they were pleased the pages had finally been released. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, said he hoped the release would quiet rumors. ‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community and the 9/11 Commission, which followed the Joint Inquiry that produced these so-called 28 pages, investigated the questions they raised and was never able to find sufficient evidence to support them,‚Äù he said. Legislation that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, was passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate and is making its way through the House, despite President Barack Obama‚Äôs veto threat. ‚ÄúWhile the pages do not reach a conclusion regarding Saudi involvement in the 9/11 attacks, they provide more than enough evidence to raise serious concerns,‚Äù said Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. His state was home to many people killed when planes hit the World Trade Center in neighboring New York. Sept. 11 families made clear the pages‚Äô release would not stop their push for the legislation. ‚ÄúCongress has to stand up for the interests of the thousands of innocent Americans who lost loved ones on 9/11,‚Äù one group said in a statement. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters before the pages were released that they would show no evidence of Saudi complicity. The Obama administration sent a declassified version of the 28 pages, with many lines and sentences blacked out to protect intelligence sources and methods, to Congress on Friday morning. The House intelligence panel released it a few hours later. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 "
Saudi says hopes release of '28 pages' clears up 9/11 suspicions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia welcomed on Friday the release of classified pages of the official report on the Sept. 11 attacks, and hoped their release would clear up suspicions about Riyadh‚Äôs actions, intentions or long-term friendship with the United States. ‚ÄúSince 2002, the 9/11 Commission and several government agencies, including the CIA and the FBI, have investigated the contents of the ‚Äò28 Pages‚Äô and have confirmed that neither the Saudi government, nor senior Saudi officials, nor any person acting on behalf of the Saudi government provided any support or encouragement for these attacks,‚Äù Saudi Arabia‚Äôs ambassador to the United States, Abdullah al-Saud, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe hope the release of these pages will clear up, once and for all, any lingering questions or suspicions about Saudi Arabia‚Äôs actions, intentions, or long-term friendship with the United States.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 "
Trump's VP pick rankles Republican gay rights activists,"CLEVELAND/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs choice of Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate has irked some Republican activists who see the Indiana governor‚Äôs years of opposition to gay rights initiatives as a setback to efforts to broaden the party‚Äôs appeal. The pick could bolster Trump‚Äôs support among religious conservatives, but it also opens up a new line of attack for Democrats and liberals seeking to paint the New York businessman as a divisive candidate, putting at risk his efforts to woo moderate voters ahead of the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.[nL1N1A10HR] Rachel Hoff, the first openly gay member of the Republican Party‚Äôs platform committee, has spent time in Cleveland ahead of next week‚Äôs party convention trying repeatedly to get the party to change its official position on gay marriage and adoption by gay couples. She was dismayed by the choice of Pence. ‚ÄúAfter the Pence announcement, I think the question is - is Trump really moderate on gay rights issues? It seems more likely his rhetoric has been a smoke screen,‚Äù Hoff said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no substance behind it. By picking Pence, Trump is signaling his administration may not be any friendlier to the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community.‚Äù Megan Robertson, a Republican strategist in Indiana who has pushed for the party to be more open to gay members, was similarly disappointed. ‚ÄúPicking Pence shows that he maybe doesn‚Äôt care about that community as much as he tried to profess that he did,‚Äù she said of Trump. Clinton‚Äôs campaign seized on the announcement to attack Pence‚Äôs record on gay rights issues, saying it ‚Äúembarrassed‚Äù the people of Indiana. Clinton has previously called Trump the most divisive candidate ‚Äúin our lifetimes,‚Äù referring to his calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country and to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. In 2015, Pence found himself at the center of a national uproar when he signed a bill that he said was meant to protect religious liberty, but which critics countered would allow business owners to deny services to gay people.  After intense pressure from liberal groups and large corporations, he asked lawmakers to clarify that businesses could not deny services on the basis of sexual orientation, calling it a ‚Äúsubject of great misunderstanding.‚Äù He has also fought against same-sex marriage and allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. A U.S. Supreme Court ruing last year legalized gay marriage nationwide and the Pentagon in 2011 ended the ban on openly gay and lesbian people serving in the military. In 2009, while a member of the U.S. Congress, Pence argued against expanding the definition of a hate crime to include sexual orientation, calling it an attempt to ‚Äúadvance a radical social agenda.‚Äù The federal hate crimes law was expanded to make this inclusion. Gay supporters of Trump are hopeful Pence will have little influence on a potential Trump administration.  Trump has declared himself the most gay-friendly candidate in the election. He expressed support for the gay community after a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June that killed 49 people, and broke from his party during an argument  about transgender bathroom usage, saying people could use the bathroom of their choosing at his office building Trump Tower in New York. That has cheered moderate Republicans who have been seeking to appeal to younger, more liberal voters. ‚ÄúDonald Trump is the nominee of the party and Donald Trump is going to set policy,‚Äù said Chris Barron, who has launched LGBTrump, a group seeking to encourage gays to vote for Trump. Pence, 57, comes from a different wing of the divided Republican Party than Trump, one that is dominated by evangelicals in southern and midwestern states. Conservatives were elated with his selection. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best conservatives could possibly want,‚Äù said Brent Bozell, a conservative leader.  The pro-gay rights group Log Cabin Republicans said it would seek to pressure the Republican Party at the Cleveland national convention to adopt a more gay-friendly policy platform, including by running a full-page ad in a local paper. The party‚Äôs platform committee met early in the week to draft official policy positions on myriad issues. The document, which carries little significance beyond the symbolic, calls for a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision legalizing gay marriage and included a veiled acceptance of gay conversion therapy, a practice that has widely been criticized as harmful to children. Despite the disappointment that gay rights activists are feeling, Log Cabin Republican president Gregory Angelo said he thinks voters are going to look at Trump‚Äôs past statement on gay rights and not where Pence stands. Trump has spent little time talking about social issues and has instead focused on immigration and economic issues.  ‚ÄúDonald Trump rose to stardom as our presumptive nominee because he showcased an opposition to illegal immigration and unfair trade deals. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs resonating with the Republican electorate this year,‚Äù he said. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 "

"EU and U.S. seek trade deal this year, knowing large hurdles remain","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU and U.S. negotiators said on Friday that they still needed to overcome large differences for a transatlantic free trade deal to be sealed this year, and factor in the impending exit from the European Union of Britain, one of the United States‚Äô biggest export markets. The two sides are trying to agree on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which supporters say could boost each economy by some $100 billion at a time when growth in China and emerging markets is slowing. Chief EU negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero and U.S. counterpart Dan Mullaney told a news conference after a 14th round of talks that both sides were committed to sealing a deal before U.S. President Barack Obama leaves office at the turn of the year. The partners have made progress on tariff elimination and on regulatory cooperation. However, they are stuck over EU demands including greater access to public sector tenders; Garcia Bercero described the U.S. offer as a serious cause of concern. Likewise, Washington is unhappy with the EU offer on services.  ‚ÄúGiven the importance of this sector to both of our economies ... progress here has been noticeably and painfully slow,‚Äù said Mullaney. He also said that, while the economic rationale for TTIP remained strong, Britain‚Äôs exit from the European Union would force a rethink as it was the largest market anywhere for U.S. services, and took 25 percent of U.S. exports to the EU. ‚ÄúImagine if the United States said, for instance, ‚ÄòWell, maybe TTIP will not apply to California‚Äô. There is a certain reflection that the parties need to have on those kind of developments.‚Äù The two sides had previously planned to produce a single consolidated TTIP text by the end of July. Garcia Bercero said that was now more likely to come by the end of September after further meetings between U.S. trade chief Michael Froman and EU commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom. Garcia Bercero acknowledged that the political environment was becoming more challenging. The environmental group Greenpeace echoed the view of many anti-TTIP campaigners on Friday by saying that it was time to hit the ‚ÄòStop‚Äô button. But the EU negotiator said TTIP was instead a positive response to concerns about globalization. ‚ÄúIf we want to have a shot at shaping globalization, we need a like-minded partner that shares largely our views,‚Äù he said. Mullaney talked of a ‚Äúunique window of opportunity‚Äù to complete TTIP this year that should not be allowed to slip away. ‚ÄúAfter this year, with one political transition after another over the next few years, it could be quite a while before we pick up negotiations again.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 "
White House hopeful Trump nears end of vice presidential search,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump neared the end of his vice presidential search on Thursday and appeared to be leaning toward Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a conservative with the potential to unify divided Republicans. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee tweeted on Wednesday night that he would announce his choice on Friday at 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) in Manhattan. The New York businessman is to be formally nominated as the party‚Äôs candidate for the Nov. 8 election at the Republican National Convention next week in Cleveland. Traditionally, the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists. Trump‚Äôs choice of running mate is seen as critical because his defeat of 16 rivals in the Republican primary race left the party divided and some party leaders are still uneasy about some of his campaign positions, and his style. Sources familiar with campaign operations cautioned that while Pence and former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich were finalists, Trump could always have a last-minute change of heart and choose someone else from his short list. A source close to the campaign said Trump appeared to be  leaning toward Pence but could easily change his mind. Gingrich told an ABC News correspondent he expected to hear Trump‚Äôs decision after 1 p.m. EDT and would not be surprised if Trump chooses Pence.  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 53, a former rival to Trump in the presidential race, is also high on the list of potential running mates and provides the kind of counterpunch to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton that Republicans like. Pence, 57, a former congressman, is seen as a safe choice, not too flashy but popular among conservatives, with Midwestern appeal and the ability to rally more party faithful behind Trump. Gingrich, 73, is a close adviser to Trump with a wealth of ideas and deep experience in the legislative process from his time as speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s. In what has been an unusually public process, Trump, 70, sat down with both Pence and Gingrich separately in Indianapolis on Wednesday. He also met with a fourth potential No. 2, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, 69, of Alabama, who has been one of Trump‚Äôs closest advisers. The New York businessman had dinner with Pence on Tuesday night after they appeared together at a rally. Trump, joined by daughter Ivanka and sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, had breakfast with Pence and his wife, Karen, on Wednesday at the governor‚Äôs residence in Indianapolis.

It shows that 37 percent of American adults have a ‚Äúsomewhat unfavorable‚Äù or ‚Äúvery unfavorable‚Äù view of Islam. This includes 58 percent of Trump supporters and 24 percent of Clinton supporters, a contrast largely mirrored by the breakdown between Republicans and Democrats. By comparison, respondents overall had an equally unfavorable view of atheism at 38 percent, compared with 21 percent for Hinduism, 16 percent for Judaism and 8¬†percent for Christianity.  Spokespeople for Trump and Clinton declined to comment. The poll took place before an attacker on Thursday drove his truck into a holiday crowd in Nice, France, killing more than 80 people in what President Francois Hollande called a terrorist act. Police sources said the driver, while linked to common crimes, was not on a watch list of intelligence services and no Islamist militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The race for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election has put a spotlight on Americans‚Äô views of Muslims with Trump proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. He repeated the proposal after Omar Mateen, a New York-born Muslim armed with an assault rifle, killed 49 people in an attack on a Florida gay nightclub last month.  The ideological divide between Trump and Clinton supporters is set against a backdrop of increasing violence and discrimination against Muslims in the United States. The poll shows 78¬†percent of Trump supporters and 36 percent of Clinton supporters said that when compared to other religions, Islam was more likely to encourage acts of terrorism. Trump supporters were also about twice as likely as Clinton supporters to say that Islam was more encouraging of¬†violence toward Americans, women and gay people. Polling on none of the other belief systems and their perceived connection to terrorism or violence came close to matching those numbers. Clinton has called for a more inclusive environment within American society and for a joint effort between the U.S. government and Muslim countries to battle the spread of Islamist militancy.  She has criticized Trump‚Äôs harsh statements about Muslims and Mexicans while Trump has bemoaned what he calls American society‚Äôs devotion to political correctness. Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/29IPJ6l Party affiliation accounted for the deepest division among Americans where their views on Muslims were concerned. Respondents‚Äô status as rich or poor, young or old, or male or female did not offer as pronounced an overall view as did their identification as Democrats or Republicans.  ‚ÄúIf it was true that Trump did not represent Republicans broadly defined, you would think Republicans would look different; they don‚Äôt,‚Äù said Douglas McAdam, a sociology professor at Stanford University who studies American politics. ‚ÄúIt goes against the claims of the (former presidential candidate) Mitt Romneys of the world, that Trump is not really a Republican, that he doesn‚Äôt represent the Republican party. He seems to be resonating with Republicans generally.‚Äù According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, attacks on American Muslims and on mosques in the United States rose in 2015 to their highest level ever recorded.  The group said 31 incidents of damage or destruction of mosques were reported; there were 11 incidents in which a Muslim person was the target of a slur or another kind of harassment.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll ran in all 50 states from June 14 to July 6. It included 7,473 American adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 1 percentage point.

House Speaker Ryan on Pence: 'No better choice',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs choice of Mike Pence as a running mate on Friday, saying the Indiana governor comes from ‚Äúthe heart of the conservative movement.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can think of no better choice for our vice-presidential candidate.

Trump's expected VP pick: coal advocate who defied Obama's climate agenda,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate cheered the U.S. energy industry and dismayed green advocates, with both sides citing Pence‚Äôs support for coal mining and defiance of President Barack Obama‚Äôs climate-change agenda. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called climate change a hoax and promised to gut U.S. environmental regulations in order to help the ailing oil and coal sectors. A Trump-Pence ticket will quash any expectation that the New York businessman might soften that stance heading into the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúGovernor Pence has been a vocal opponent of the administration‚Äôs Clean Power Plan,‚Äù said Laura Sheehan, spokeswoman for the Washington-based lobby group American Council on Clean Coal Electricity.   ‚ÄúWe would hope to see a continuation,‚Äù she said. Trump announced Pence as his running mate in a Twitter post on Friday morning, ending days of speculation over the choice ahead of the party‚Äôs national convention in Cleveland next week. [nL1N1A10HR] Pence, 57, is listed on Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúcall out the climate change deniers‚Äù website for arguing that the science behind climate change has not yet been resolved. In June 2015, Pence wrote to Obama saying that Indiana, America‚Äôs eighth largest coal-producing state, would not comply with the Clean Power Plan regulating power plant emissions, calling it ‚Äúill-advised.‚Äù Indiana is one of more than 25 states that have challenged the centerpiece of the Democratic president‚Äôs environmental agenda. In 2014, Pence alarmed local environmental groups by overturning an energy efficiency program enacted by his Republican predecessor, Mitch Daniels, saying it was too expensive for the state‚Äôs manufacturers. The Indiana Public Utility Commission had estimated the program would create more than 18,600 jobs. ‚ÄúThe choice of Pence shows Trump has little interest in appealing to anyone outside of his extremist base and Big Polluters,‚Äù said Clay Schroers, a director at the League of Conservation Voters environmental group.     Trump has long signaled his support of traditional energy production - part of his broader appeal to blue-collar American voters.  He outlined plans in May to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by Obama, scrap the Paris Climate Accord, and revive the Keystone XL pipeline proposal ‚Äì moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement. Trump‚Äôs Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in contrast, has promised more stringent regulation of the energy sector, efforts to boost renewable fuels use, and a commitment to join other nations to combat global climate change. Pence ran for governor in 2012 after serving in the U.S. Congress. His campaign for governor received more than $850,000 from the energy sector, about 3 percent of the total, according to campaign finance disclosures. More than $300,000 of that came from the billionaire Koch brothers, strong advocates of small government and fiscal conservatism who took a liking to Pence. Both David and Charles Koch have said they will not support the Trump ticket. Trump has alarmed many Republican establishment figures with his fiery rhetoric on immigration and trade.  But a former high-ranking operative in the Koch political organization who is close to both brothers said Pence could help make the donor network more receptive to Trump‚Äôs campaign.

Trump backers sue San Jose for allowing 'mob' assault,"(Reuters) - Police in the California city of San Jose, motivated by the political leanings of city officials, allowed an angry mob to assault Donald Trump supporters as they left a rally for the presumptive Republican presidential candidate last month, a lawsuit filed on Thursday alleges. The civil lawsuit, filed by 14 Trump supporters against the city of San Jose, its mayor, police chief and a number of other individuals, says police funneled Trump supporters outside the city‚Äôs convention center directly into a crowd of hundreds of ‚Äúphysically violent and aggressive‚Äù protesters. The plaintiffs add that city officials directed roughly 250 San Jose police officers not to intervene amid a melee of ‚Äúviolent criminal acts perpetrated by dozens of anti-Trump protesters.‚Äù The San Jose City Attorney, Richard Doyle, said he had not yet read the complaint, but that police made many arrests and the city is ‚Äúcommitted to first amendment rights and protecting people.‚Äù A police department spokesman referred inquiries to Doyle‚Äôs office. Mayor Sam Liccardo, a Democrat, said in statement that the city will do ‚Äúeverything necessary‚Äù to prosecute those who acted illegally. ‚ÄúThe ludicrous accusation that I somehow directed the police department to ‚Äòstand down‚Äô at the rally is utterly false,‚Äù Liccardo said. Tense and sometimes violent demonstrations have peppered Trump‚Äôs political rallies in New Mexico and California in recent months. Protesters are also expected to converge on the Republican National Convention next week in Cleveland. Hundreds of people in San Jose, many angry over Trump‚Äôs statements about immigration, gathered outside his event last month. Members of the crowd waved Mexican flags, chanted anti-Trump slogans, and burned Trump hats along with at least one U.S. flag. The lawsuit alleges Liccardo, police chief Edgardo Garcia, and some 40 other people stripped Trump backers of their rights to free speech and assembly. According to the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified compensation, one Trump backer was pelted with eggs and spat on, while another, a 71-year-old woman, had her hair pulled and her glasses broken. At one point, the lawsuit says, a 14-year-old boy was struck in the back of his head as members of the crowd shouted, ‚ÄúKill him!‚Äù  Speaking at a campaign event the day after the events in San Jose, Trump described the rally as ‚Äúa love fest inside. No problems whatsoever.‚Äù But then his supporters ‚Äúwalked out and they got accosted by a bunch of thugs,‚Äù he said. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 "
"U.S. House passes Iran sanctions, financial services measures","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed two pieces of legislation linked to the international nuclear agreement with Iran on Thursday, one year after the landmark pact was announced, defying President Barack Obama‚Äôs veto threat. Voting largely along party lines, the Republican-controlled House voted 246 to 179 to pass a new set of sanctions on Iran, and 246 to 181 for a measure to block Iran‚Äôs access to the U.S. financial system, including use of the dollar. The House on Wednesday passed a bill to bar the U.S. purchase of ‚Äúheavy water,‚Äù also with little backing from Democrats. Heavy water is a non-radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The Obama administration said in April the United States would buy $8.6 million worth of heavy water from Iran, angering Republicans who called it a subsidy of the country‚Äôs nuclear program. The measures were among the last the House passed before Congress left Washington for a seven-week summer recess. There was no word on when, or whether, the measures would be taken up in the Senate. Every congressional Republican, and several of Obama‚Äôs fellow Democrats, opposed the nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and other world powers announced in July 2015 in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions. Since then, Republicans have repeatedly offered sanctions bills and other Iran-related legislation that Democrats dismiss as bids to score political points by undermining a deal seen as a potential foreign policy legacy for Obama. Republicans say they want to punish Iran for actions including its ballistic missile tests and send a strong message that Tehran should abide by its international commitments.

"In Virginia, Clinton tests Senator Tim Kaine as a 'safe' VP pick","WASHINGTON/ANNANDALE, Virginia (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton campaigned with potential vice presidential running-mate U.S. Senator Tim Kaine in his home state of Virginia on Thursday, testing whether the person widely seen as the ‚Äúsafe choice‚Äù can propel her to the White House in November.  Kaine‚Äôs 16-minute introduction of the presumptive Democratic nominee in a community college gymnasium in the Washington suburb of Annandale reflected Clinton‚Äôs need to reach out to Hispanic voters with her vice presidential pick. Kaine, a former missionary in Honduras who speaks Spanish, peppered his introduction with Spanish phrases and criticism of Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs statements regarding Latinos. ‚ÄúHe trash talks Latinos - to him it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a new immigrant or you‚Äôre a worker who has been here for a long time or a DREAMer or if you‚Äôre a Latina governor of New Mexico or a federal judge,‚Äù Kaine said to applause. Kaine was referring to statements Trump has made about young immigrants brought to the United States by their parents, New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and the judge overseeing a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump University. Kaine could help Clinton check a lot of boxes in the list of requirements for a running mate.  The former civil rights lawyer is a Virginian, which could help Clinton win a battleground state in the Nov. 8 race against Trump. Such states are hotly contested because their populations can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections. Kaine is also affable, savvy about foreign policy and has executive experience as a former governor of Virginia and a former mayor of Richmond, the state‚Äôs capital. Though the Clinton campaign is keeping the vice presidential selection process tightly under wraps, many Democrats in Washington see Kaine as the front-runner. Some Democrats in Congress and in outside groups want to see Clinton make a more unconventional pick for her already historic run as the first female presidential nominee of a major party. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a fierce critic of Wall Street, and Julian Castro, a Latino who is the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, are two possibilities mentioned by Democrats who want to see Clinton go with a bold choice before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia July 25-28. Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Representative Xavier Becerra of California, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and, more recently, retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis have also been mentioned as possibilities. Asked about Kaine, Artie Blanco, a superdelegate from Nevada, said he would not be her top pick. ‚ÄúExcited, no. OK with, you know, sure,‚Äù she said. Blanco said she likes Becerra and Perez as potential picks. She said Warren ‚Äúwould be fantastic‚Äù and she likes Brown‚Äôs stance on worker issues. Thursday‚Äôs event with Kaine gave Clinton an opportunity to gauge whether the 58-year-old, Harvard-educated senator would help her fire up a crowd and make for a comfortable fit on the campaign trail.  Cynthia Smith, a registered nurse from Cleveland, was at the event because her nephew is a volunteer with the campaign. She said she was not familiar with Kaine and would like to hear more from him, but at this point preferred Warren. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see two women,‚Äù Smith said. Clinton had lunch with Democratic senators on Capitol Hill on Thursday. After the session, the lawmakers were mostly mum. When Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the top Democrat, was asked by a reporter what the takeaway from the lunch was, he responded: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to be president.‚Äù Clinton spoke to the senators about returning the Senate to Democratic control and about how to create jobs in all 50 U.S. states. Some Democratic senators have been rallying around colleague Kaine, while others are holding out for a bolder pick. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who has served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with Kaine, said in a brief interview: ‚ÄúIf you look at the totality of Tim‚Äôs life and his work, I think there are elements that would bridge that divide‚Äù between progressive Democrats and more establishment Democrats who have fostered Clinton‚Äôs drive for the White House.

Kerry's Syria plan greeted with concern over Russian intentions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Thursday to propose close military coordination in Syria, the White House and Pentagon offered lukewarm support for the plan and demanded that Moscow show it was serious about fighting Islamic State, not just propping up President Bashar al-Assad.Kerry himself took a tough line after his meeting on Thursday with Putin, State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Moscow.  ‚ÄúSecretary Kerry emphasized that absent concrete, near-term steps, diplomatic efforts could not continue indefinitely,‚Äù Kirby said. Kerry‚Äôs proposal would create a new center where U.S. and Russian militaries would share intelligence and coordinate air strikes against Islamic State and the Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate. The move has angered U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats who argue that Russia has proved repeatedly that it cannot be trusted. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said Defense Secretary Ash Carter supported Kerry‚Äôs efforts to encourage Moscow to ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù in Syria. But he added that Carter has experience dealing with Moscow and maintains a ‚Äúhealthy dose of skepticism‚Äù about Russia‚Äôs aims in the conflict. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúThe secretary supports Secretary Kerry‚Äôs effort ... but he has also said that he‚Äôs had questions about the Russian activities up to this point,‚Äù Cook told reporters. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúIf the Russians are prepared to do the right thing in Syria, then the secretary of defense would be open to that conversation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre waiting to see what‚Äôs going on. ... It‚Äôs not clear that we‚Äôll ever reach an agreement.‚Äù WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT‚ÄôS UP TO RUSSIA At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest‚Äôs response was similarly cautious. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Russia to make serious decisions about how they want to use their influence inside of Syria both when it comes to their diplomatic influence, but also when it comes to their military capabilities,‚Äù Earnest told a daily briefing on Thursday at the White House,  ‚ÄúThey have to decide if they‚Äôre going to use the military to prop up the Assad regime or if they‚Äôre going to use their military to go after extremists,‚Äù Earnest said, ‚ÄúOur case is you can‚Äôt do both.‚Äù Kerry has expressed growing frustration with the lack of progress in ending Syria‚Äôs five-year civil war despite agreements with Russia to secure a lasting nationwide cessation of hostilities and ensure that humanitarian aid reaches besieged communities. U.N.-led efforts to bring the warring sides together to negotiate a political transition also have failed. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau acknowledged  a ‚Äúvery robust and very vigorous conversation‚Äù among government agencies over Kerry‚Äôs plan. Asked whether Kerry‚Äôs visit had the full backing of the White House, she added: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to characterize that for the White House, but I would say that the secretary is going to ... have discussions in Moscow that present the administration‚Äôs views.‚Äù Anger Within the Administration¬†¬†¬† But U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats involved in Syria policy expressed anger about Kerry‚Äôs proposal, which several called naive. ¬†¬†¬†¬†The Russians, said one official, had known for weeks about Kerry‚Äôs upcoming visit to Moscow, yet two days before he was due to arrive they bombed a remote camp near Syria‚Äôs border with Jordan used by U.S.-backed rebels. ‚ÄúThat is consistent with what the Russians have been doing all along,‚Äù said a U.S. military official, who like others spoke anonymously to criticize administration policy. ‚ÄúMore of it has been to us, not with us, and the message has been clear all along: ‚ÄòWhen our interests differ from yours, ours win.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve violated every cessation of hostilities agreement they‚Äôve ever agreed to, sometimes within hours,‚Äù the official said. ¬†¬†¬† Another American official, who has helped train members of the Free Syrian Army rebel alliance, said the U.S.-backed opposition forces have been asking why the administration keeps seeking Russian help and are growing increasingly bitter, their anger compounded by what they complain is a lack of American military support. Former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford expressed deep skepticism with Kerry‚Äôs plan, saying Russian air strikes have primarily targeted U.S-supported moderate opposition groups. ‚ÄúHow serious are they (Russia) about defeating terrorism, as opposed to bolstering Assad‚Äôs position at the center? How are we to assume that they are going to do better if they work with the Americans?‚Äù Ford told Reuters. Ford said that Russia has been unable to get its ‚Äúobstreperous client‚Äù Assad to make any political concessions, allow significant humanitarian assistance into numerous rebel-held enclaves or abide by a cessation of hostilities agreement. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the Russians can deliver,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how this American-Russian condominium on the Islamic State can help bring about a negotiated solution to the broader Syrian conflict. It will make it less likely that Assad will make concessions that will bring the broader civil war to an end.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "
"Senators urge U.S. to close lead testing gaps, citing Reuters investigation","(Reuters) - Some influential U.S. senators are urging a federal agency to take action to ensure more children are tested for lead poisoning, citing a Reuters investigation that found millions are missing required lead tests, leaving some vulnerable to lifelong health effects. In a three-page letter to be sent on Friday, U.S. senators including Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Deborah Stabenow of Michigan, all Democrats, called on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to re-evaluate its lead screening policy for millions of Medicaid-eligible children. The senators want CMS to improve U.S. blood lead testing rates they called ‚Äúdismal,‚Äù and to ensure all state Medicaid programs comply with testing rules and provide treatment for children with elevated blood lead levels. Medicaid is a U.S. government program that provides health care for low-income and disabled people.  The letter, provided to Reuters by Brown‚Äôs office, cites a June¬†Reuters investigation (reut.rs/1YgbjCX) detailing how millions of U.S. children are falling through the cracks of early childhood lead testing requirements. Though Medicaid has long required children in the program to receive blood lead tests at ages one and two, Reuters obtained data from nearly a dozen states showing that only 41 percent of Medicaid-eligible children were tested as required in 2014. ¬†   Those shortfalls left some children vulnerable to prolonged and preventable lead exposure, which can stunt their cognitive development and cause permanent mental and physical ailments. ¬†   Concerns about childhood lead exposure have grown sharply after children in Flint, Michigan were poisoned by lead-tainted drinking water starting in 2014. Across the country, more than 500,000 U.S. children have elevated lead levels, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another exposure risk is old lead paint in millions of homes built before 1978. In Cleveland, Ohio, for instance, 13.7 percent of children tested had elevated levels of lead in their blood, Reuters found. ‚ÄúChildren in Ohio are being poisoned by their own homes,‚Äù Senator Brown said on Thursday. ‚ÄúTo protect our children, we need better coordination between federal and state health agencies and Medicaid physicians.‚Äù Experts cited several factors for the gaps: some doctors do not order the tests or are unaware of Medicaid and state rules; children miss appointments or parents do not follow up on test referrals; and Medicaid and health departments do little to enforce testing. The testing guidelines are often confusing, and federal and state data on lead testing contain gaps. In the letter, the lawmakers urge CMS to take steps to get more children tested and to review and update its lead screening protocols, and help guide state Medicaid administrators to make sure all at-risk children get screened.

Protesters keeping kids away from Cleveland Republican convention,"(Reuters) - A Milwaukee-based immigrants rights group canceled plans to take children to demonstrations outside the Republican National Convention, which starts on Monday, citing fears of violence after last week‚Äôs shootings in Dallas. Voces de la Frontera (Voices from the Border) typically includes children in its marches, seeking to humanize the debate over immigration policy, but opted against that in Cleveland because ‚Äúthings can escalate,‚Äù group member Daniel Gutierrez said. Donald Trump is expected to officially become the Republican candidate for president at the convention, which runs from Monday to Thursday, when myriad protest groups from around the country are expected to converge on Cleveland. Protests at Trump campaign events have turned volatile, and tensions could be heightened by the presence of citizens carrying firearms. Ohio gun laws will allow people to openly carry firearms at the protests, while more innocuous items such as tennis balls, umbrellas with steel points and water guns will be prohibited. Police said the presence of openly carried weapons complicated their job at the Dallas protest shootings, when a former U.S. Army reservist shot dead five police officers, seeking revenge for police killings of black men. About 45 members of Voces de la Frontera plan to participate in a Coalition to Stop Trump rally on Monday, said Gutierrez, adding that he was unafraid that others may bring guns. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúIf anything comes up that puts our lives at risk, we definitely are not going to stand there. If anything breaks out, just remove ourselves from there. Go to a safe location,‚Äù Gutierrez said. Brad Sigal, a spokesman for the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, said his organization was training marshals to keep the group safe, primarily by steering members clear of  potential confrontations. About 50 of its members would travel to Cleveland, he said. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúThere will be a lot of police there, there may be counterprotests, but we‚Äôre there to get our message out and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to do,‚Äù Sigal said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aware of the situation and preparing for it.‚Äù Rustbelt Medics, a group of street medics that volunteers first aid at political events, has been conducting medical training in preparation for the convention.

U.S. lawmakers introduce bill to criminalize ‚Äòrevenge porn‚Äô,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced long-stalled legislation on Thursday that would make it a federal crime to share sexually explicit material of a person online without the subject‚Äôs consent. The ‚ÄúIntimate Privacy Protection Act‚Äù is an effort several years in the making to combat the rise in recent years of ‚Äúrevenge porn,‚Äù images that are shared on the internet in order to extort or humiliate someone. The practice disproportionately affects women. ‚ÄúThese acts of bullying have ruined careers, families, and even led to suicide,‚Äù Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat and lead author of the bill, said in a statement.  The legislation would allow fines and up to five years in prison for posting online or distributing sexually explicit photos or videos with ‚Äúreckless disregard‚Äù for the consent of the subject. More than 30 states have enacted similar laws in recent years.  Exceptions listed in the bill would allow for posting material that is in the public interest or that features a person voluntarily posing nude in a public or commercial setting. The bill stalled for years amid concerns raised by technology companies and internet freedom advocates worried that service providers such as Alphabet Inc‚Äôs YouTube could be exposed to liability for acting as third-party hosts of revenge porn content shared by users.  Speier‚Äôs bill, which was introduced with support from Facebook and Twitter, exempts such companies as long as they do not promote or solicit revenge porn content. Many tech companies have tightened their terms of service in recent years to prohibit revenge porn. Those companies typically rely on users to report objectionable content to teams of human reviewers who delete content found to violate terms of service. Democratic Representatives Katherine Clark and Gregory Meeks and Republican Representatives Ryan Costello and Tom Rooney joined the bill as original co-sponsors. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 "

Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg 'regrets' Trump criticisms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Thursday said she regrets making critical comments about Republican presidential contender Donald Trump. ‚ÄúOn reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill-advised and I regret making them,‚Äù she said in a statement issued by the court. Ginsburg, the 83-year-old senior liberal member of the high court, inserted herself into the U.S. presidential election in recent days by making negative remarks about Trump in a series of media interviews.  Her earlier remarks prompted criticism from Trump, who said she should resign. In one of a series of Twitter posts, he also said Ginsburg‚Äôs ‚Äúmind is shot.‚Äù The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ginsburg‚Äôs statement. Legal ethics scholars also questioned Ginsburg‚Äôs actions, saying Supreme Court justices should stay out the political fray in order to maintain their judicial integrity. The New York Times and the Washington Post chided Ginsburg in editorial articles. ‚ÄúJudges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future I will be more circumspect,‚Äù Ginsburg said. In a CNN interview posted on Tuesday, Ginsburg called the presumptive Republican nominee ‚Äúa faker.‚Äù In a separate interview with the New York Times, Ginsburg joked about moving to New Zealand if Trump wins the White House. Under a code of conduct that federal judges - but not Supreme Court justices - are required to follow, judges are forbidden from publicly endorsing or opposing candidates for public office.  Supreme Court justices generally shy away from discussing politics or other divisive issues in public. Ginsburg is one of the more outspoken members of the court but had never before made such pointed remarks about a political candidate. The controversy erupted as Trump prepared for the opening of the July 18-21 Republican convention, which will formally make him the party‚Äôs presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. The Supreme Court has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 "

Or look at the tree with umbrellas hanging to dry on it outside a rainy Sanders rally in Buffalo, New York, after the Secret Service prevented supporters from carrying them inside. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure one person did it, and then the other person thought it was a good idea, and then the next thing you know, there are 30 umbrellas,‚Äù Snyder said. ‚ÄúIt was just one of those funny things.‚Äù Veteran Reuters photographer Mike Segar described covering this year‚Äôs U.S. presidential campaign as ‚Äústrangely fun.‚Äù  In a 23-year Reuters career, Segar has covered five presidential elections, but said that this one was different, especially with New York businessman Donald Trump, who became the presumptive Republican nominee, playing a starring role. ‚ÄúThe tone of the Trump campaign makes everything different for everybody,‚Äù Segar said. He added that heightened security around Trump had also impacted how photographers illustrate the campaign.        Segar took a photograph of one of his own meals when he was covering a Clinton rally: hamburger meat on a bed of undressed spinach in a tinfoil to-go container.  ‚ÄúI was trying to give viewers a little bit of a different taste of what we see on a day to day basis,‚Äù Segar said with a laugh.  ‚ÄúYour photos don‚Äôt necessarily have to capture the most earth-shattering moments of the campaign, but they have to capture people‚Äôs interest.‚Äù Reuters photographer Lucas Jackson said he always looked for a different angle at rallies. In one of his photos, young reporters can be seen staring into the screens of their Macbook laptops at a Sanders rally in Pennsylvania. ‚ÄúUsually cameras are pointed at the candidate,‚Äù Jackson Said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always looking to add context.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 "
New U.S. bill to tax financial trading brings campaign issue to the fore,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio on Wednesday unveiled legislation to tax financial trades that will likely wither in Congress but could stoke partisan fires in the presidential election. The Oregon Democrat‚Äôs bill would levy a 0.03 percent tax on most financial trades, and is intended to discourage ‚Äúrisky trading behaviors.‚Äù DeFazio expects that will collect more than $417 billion in revenue in the next decade, which he said could be used to fund free higher education or infrastructure repairs. When the Democratic Party gathers in Philadelphia for its national convention at the end of the month, it will adopt a platform that calls for taxing trades. Many liberals in the party embrace the proposal as a way to curb speculative trading, which they say led to both the 2007-09 financial crisis and the 2010 stock market ‚Äúflash crash.‚Äù The party‚Äôs left wing, led by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran against Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination, meanwhile, has pushed for free university education. ‚ÄúThanks to the reckless greed of Wall Street over the past few decades, the American economy is a grossly unbalanced playing field,‚Äù said DeFazio. ‚ÄúThe only way we can level it is if we rein in reckless speculative financial trading and curb near-instantaneous high-volume trades that create instability in the stock market and our national economy.‚Äù The legislation is supported by Democratic Party stalwarts, including the AFL-CIO labor union federation, the Americans for Financial Reform coalition, the Communications Workers of America union, and advocacy group Public Citizen. The Center for Economic and Policy Research said it also backs the bill. It will likely not get far. Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and most say that Wall Street regulation passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis has been overly restrictive. In addition, the Republican Party generally favors having fewer taxes. ‚ÄúI am opposed to any taxes that would raise the cost of financial transactions,‚Äù said Randy Neugebauer, the Republican chairman of a House subcommittee on financial institutions, noting that the bill would tax stock, bond and derivatives trades.  Currently, the top U.S. securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, charges a tax on security futures of less than half of a penny to recover the costs of regulating markets and financial professionals. The idea for the tax can be traced back to economist John Maynard Keynes, who wrote in 1935 after another devastating financial crisis - the Great Depression - that a transfer tax on all transactions might mitigate speculation. (This version of the story corrects reference to Center for Economic and Policy Research in 7th paragraph, which had been incorrectly described as a Democratic stalwart) ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "
"Factbox: Five facts about Mike Pence, Trump's running mate pick","(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump will name Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate on Friday, U.S. news organizations reported on Thursday. Here are five facts about Pence, a Republican who previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives: Pence did not initially support Trump. Shortly before Indiana‚Äôs Republican primary election in May, Pence endorsed Trump‚Äôs rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Pence praised Trump at the time, but he compared Cruz to former Republican President Ronald Reagan and called him a ‚Äúprincipled conservative.‚Äù Trump won the state anyway, and Cruz dropped out of the Republican race. Trump and Pence have since met to discuss the running mate position. WELL-CONNECTED WITH DONORS Pence has strong ties to billionaire donors Charles and David Koch, including current and former staff members who have worked for them. After saying he was primarily self-funding his campaign during the Republican primaries, Trump has been holding fundraisers during the general election, with support from the Republican National Committee. The New York businessman comes to the money race at a considerable disadvantage, however, compared with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Pence sometimes describes himself as ‚Äúa Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.‚Äù Pence in 2015 signed a religious freedom law that critics said opened the door to anti-gay discrimination. When he was in Congress, he opposed repealing the military‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù policy on sexual orientation. He also has pushed restrictive abortion regulations and has pushed for Congress to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit women‚Äôs health provider that performs some abortions. He was a vocal opponent of the 2008 Wall Street bailout. In September 2008, Pence, then a U.S. House member, argued against the $700 billion package to stabilize the U.S. financial system, saying it would ‚Äúnationalize almost every bad mortgage in America.‚Äù  Pence also said the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation passed in 2010 would hurt jobs. Trump has vowed to dismantle Dodd-Frank, though he has not said how he would replace it. Pence opposed allowing Syrian refugees coming to the United States to settle in Indiana. In November 2015, the governor directed state agencies to suspend the resettlement of Syrians there. A family that was supposed to arrive in December was instead sent to Connecticut. A federal judge later ruled the order ‚Äúclearly discriminates‚Äù against refugees from a particular country. However, Pence tweeted disapproval in 2015 for plans to ban Muslims from entering the United States, an idea Trump has advocated. Pence called it ‚Äúoffensive and unconstitutional.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 "

Trump demands U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg resign over criticism,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump thrust the U.S. Supreme Court into the presidential campaign debate on Wednesday, rallying conservatives with a call for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to resign after she lambasted him in a series of media interviews. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee led a chorus of outrage over the comments by Ginsburg, who described Trump as a ‚Äúfaker‚Äù and speculated about the possibility of moving to New Zealand if he won the White House. In a post-midnight counterattack on Twitter, Trump said the 83-year-old leader of the court‚Äôs liberal wing had ‚Äúembarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!‚Äù The furor gave Trump a cause to help galvanize conservatives divided over his unorthodox candidacy but concerned that the high court is too liberal, a mistrust fueled by recent rulings upholding racial preferences in university admissions and striking down tough abortion restrictions in Texas. In three recent interviews, Ginsburg questioned how Trump had gotten away with not turning over his tax returns and said she could not bear to think about the wealthy real estate developer winning the White House. In response, Trump said Ginsburg had politicized the Supreme Court with her comments and suggested she owed her fellow justices an apology. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm questioning her mental capacity,‚Äù he told Fox News Channel on Wednesday. ‚ÄúFor her to have done that is an absolute disgrace to the Supreme Court.‚Äù    Other Republicans jumped to join the attack, saying Ginsburg had proven she could not be an impartial voice on the country‚Äôs highest court. ‚ÄúFor someone on the Supreme Court who is going to be calling balls and strikes in the future based upon whatever the next president or Congress does, that strikes me as inherently biased and out of the realm,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on CNN on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called her comments ‚Äútotally inappropriate,‚Äù while Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Ginsburg‚Äôs statements reflected poorly on her objectivity. The New York Times and Washington Post joined in the rebukes, with the Times asking her to uphold the court‚Äôs tradition of silence in political campaigns and drop the ‚Äúpunditry and name-calling.‚Äù Ginsburg‚Äôs comments could push some on the right who have reservations about Trump into his camp, said Jonathan Adler, a conservative professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law who is not a Trump supporter. ‚ÄúThere are some (not me) who learn to like Trump based on the enemies he makes,‚Äù he said in an email. The controversy erupted as Trump prepared for the opening of the July 18-21 Republican convention, which will formally make him the party‚Äôs presidential nominee in the Nov. 8 election. Ginsburg is the senior liberal on the court, which has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February. ‚ÄúThis gives Trump the ability to attack not only Justice Ginsburg but ultimately the authority of the Supreme Court. That is a very bad situation,‚Äù said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who served as a lawyer in the White House under Republican President George W. Bush. U.S. Supreme Court justices are not required to follow the code of judicial conduct that applies to judges on lower federal courts. The code, set by the U.S. Judicial Conference, says judges should not ‚Äúmake speeches for a political organization or candidate, or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.‚Äù Still, the justices typically try to stay out of the political fray. The court has a sometimes pivotal role as a judicial counterweight to the executive and legislative branches of government, deciding some of the most divisive social issues in American life. In recent years, major rulings legalized gay marriage nationwide and upheld Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs healthcare overhaul.  In public remarks earlier this year, Chief Justice John Roberts stressed it was important for the justices not to be seen as political players, saying criticisms of partisanship, which he described as inaccurate, were damaging to the court‚Äôs reputation. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt work as Democrats or Republicans,‚Äù he said. Ginsburg was not immediately available for comment on Trump‚Äôs remarks and the other rebukes. The high court, whose nine justices are nominated by the U.S. president to lifetime appointments, had already been caught up in political controversy as the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate refused to take up Obama‚Äôs nominee to replace Scalia, Merrick Garland. Republicans have said the next president should be allowed to nominate a replacement for Scalia. Trump has emphasized the importance of naming conservative justices to the court. The next president, potentially serving two four-year terms, could have the opportunity to appoint up to three new justices, not including Scalia‚Äôs replacement. Ginsburg is the oldest of the justices. Justice Anthony Kennedy turns 80 on July 23, while Justice Stephen Breyer turns 78 in August. Some Democrats defended Ginsburg, with U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana saying ‚Äúshe called him (Trump) for what she saw‚Äù and Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota saying, ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs the ultimate determiner of what‚Äôs appropriate and what isn‚Äôt.‚Äù But Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre well served by Supreme Court justices openly expressing their political opinions.‚Äù Asked about Ginsburg‚Äôs remarks, White House spokesman Josh Earnest responded with a joke referencing a nickname used widely on social media by Ginsburg‚Äôs admirers. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt earn the nickname ‚Äòthe Notorious R.B.G.‚Äô for nothing,‚Äù he said. The name was inspired by rapper Notorious B.I.G. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "
U.S. says allies oppose bill allowing 9/11 lawsuits against Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. State Department officials told members of Congress on Tuesday that legislation that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia is opposed by important U.S. allies and posed a national security risk. But many members of a House of Representatives Judiciary Committee subcommittee expressed strong support at a hearing for the ‚ÄúJustice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,‚Äù or JASTA, which the Senate passed in May by unanimous voice vote despite President Barack Obama‚Äôs veto threat. The Saudis, who deny responsibility for the 2001 attacks, strongly oppose the legislation. Other governments have also raised objections. The Dutch parliament warned that JASTA would represent a breach of Dutch sovereignty. A member of the British parliament wrote a column opposing it. Anne Patterson, the State Department‚Äôs assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, and Brian Egan, its legal counsel, testified that the measure could lead to lawsuits against the United States and discourage security cooperation such as intelligence sharing between governments. ‚ÄúWe cannot win the fight against ISIL without full international cooperation,‚Äù Patterson said, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group. But the bill‚Äôs supporters say it would provide justice to those who lost loved ones in the attacks 15 years ago. They argue that if Saudi Arabia was not responsible for the attacks, it would win any lawsuits. Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents New York City, said worry about retaliation should not keep the measure from becoming law. ‚ÄúThat is no reason to deny justice to the victims of 9/11 and their families,‚Äù he said. If it became law, JASTA would remove sovereign immunity preventing lawsuits against governments for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. It would allow survivors of the attacks, and relatives of those killed in the attacks, to seek damages from other countries. In this case, it would allow lawsuits to proceed in federal court in New York as lawyers try to prove that the Saudis were involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. There was no immediate word on when the House might vote on JASTA. The House was due to adjourn later on Thursday for its summer recess and will not return to Washington until September.

European politicians wary on Republican convention over Trump,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Britain‚Äôs Nigel Farage will be at the Republican convention in Cleveland next week to dole out lessons from his Brexit campaign. So will Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom Party, who sees Donald Trump as an ally in his crusade to prevent an ‚ÄúIslamization‚Äù of the West. But some mainstream European conservatives who have traveled to previous Republican gatherings admit in private to being horrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency and are boycotting this year‚Äôs spectacle, which runs from July 18-21. Many of the center-right politicians making the trip from Europe admit to secretly rooting for Trump‚Äôs Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. They are going not to support Trump, they say, but to witness ‚Äúthe Donald‚Äù in the flesh and experience what is shaping up to be one of the rowdiest, most unpredictable Republican conventions in decades. ‚ÄúWe will see whether Trump can reinvent himself at the convention,‚Äù Guenter Krings, a senior lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs conservatives who will make the trip with just one other Bundestag colleague, told Reuters. ‚ÄúOne can only hope so, but I have my doubts.‚Äù Politicians from around the world are invited every four years to attend the Republican and Democratic conventions as part of a formal visitors program that includes briefings with campaign managers, pollsters and foreign policy experts. They also spend time in the main convention hall. This year, nearly 120 politicians from center-right parties outside the United States are expected, roughly half of them from Europe.  Trump‚Äôs candidacy has presented European parties with traditional links to U.S. Republicans with a dilemma. Many view his positions ‚Äî on issues like immigration, security, trade and the divisive Brexit question ‚Äî as closer to those of upstart far-right parties whose rise they are struggling to contain. Four years ago, when Mitt Romney was the Republican candidate, the center-right European People‚Äôs Party (EPP), the largest grouping in the European Parliament, sent a delegation of eight members to Tampa. This year there will be no EPP delegation because no-one from the group expressed an interest in attending. Despite the wariness, there is a reluctance to criticize the famously thin-skinned Trump too openly, in part out of fear he could win the election in November and punish his foreign critics, as he threatened to do when David Cameron, the recently departed British prime minister, slammed Trump‚Äôs proposal for a temporary U.S. ban on Muslims as ‚Äúdivisive, stupid and wrong‚Äù. While the conservative mainstream is leery, Europe‚Äôs array of nationalist, anti-immigration parties seem fascinated by Trump, even if some are uneasy about embracing the New York real estate businessman, who has vowed to ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù. A spokesman for Britain‚Äôs UKIP party in Brussels confirmed that Farage would attend to ‚Äúgive them some lessons‚Äù on Brexit. And Wilders told Reuters that he would be in Cleveland and wanted to meet Trump there. ‚ÄúI hope Donald Trump becomes America‚Äôs next president,‚Äù Wilders said. ‚ÄúSuch a victory would be good for Europe. America and Europe are threatened by the same danger of cultural relativism and Islam.‚Äù Austria‚Äôs far-right Freedom Party, France‚Äôs National Front and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) are not planning to send anyone to Cleveland, the parties said. ‚ÄúWe are neutral,‚Äù Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache told Reuters when asked if he supported Trump. ‚ÄúHe defends American interests. He is saying some things that need to be said.‚ÄùAlso absent will be Italy‚Äôs Northern League, whose leader Matteo Salvini describes himself as an enthusiastic Trump fan but learned earlier this year that the admiration was not necessarily mutual. Salvini traveled to Pennsylvania in April to attend a Trump rally. He was photographed shaking hands with the Republican candidate and his party said Trump had endorsed Salvini to become Italian prime minister. But a month later, Trump denied in an interview ever having met Salvini and said he had no interest in doing so. Eirik Moen of the International Democrat Union, which coordinates trips to the convention by center-right politicians across the world, said that numbers could be dented this year because countries like Britain, Spain and Australia are in the midst of political transitions, making it difficult for some to travel. Still, eight British Conservatives who sit in the European Parliament are expected to be in Cleveland. On the continent, France‚Äôs main center-right party, les Republicains, is not sending a delegation. And the contingent from Merkel‚Äôs Christian Democrats (CDU) is unusually small. In Germany, political debate is conducted in a sober, reserved manner and personal attacks are rare, even during election campaigns. Hence the mix of shock and horror at the tone of the U.S. race. Trump has dismissed Merkel as ‚Äúinsane‚Äù for letting hundreds of thousands of refugees into the country. And his idea to build a wall along the Mexican border elicits shudders in Berlin, a city that was divided by its own wall for nearly three decades and will celebrate the 27th anniversary of its fall a day after U.S. voters cast their ballots on Nov. 8. ‚ÄúMany of Donald Trump‚Äôs positions ‚Äî for example his stance toward Muslims, toward immigration from Mexico and gun ownership ‚Äî are simply not compatible with the positions of the conservatives and other parties in Germany,‚Äù said Juergen Hardt, a CDU lawmaker who also acts as the government‚Äôs coordinator for transatlantic relations. Hardt said he is planning to go on vacation with his family next week and won‚Äôt be able to attend the convention. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 "
"U.S. presidential race tied, Clinton hurt by emails: poll","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. presidential race is tied going into the major parties‚Äô national conventions and Democrat Hillary Clinton has been damaged by the FBI investigation into her email use while secretary of state, a new opinion poll showed on Thursday. The New York Times/CBS News poll showed 67 percent of voters surveyed said Clinton was not honest and trustworthy, up 5 percentage points from a CBS poll conducted last month before the FBI made its findings public. As Donald Trump prepares to accept the Republican presidential nomination next week, the poll showed him in a dead heat with Clinton in a general election matchup. Each candidate drew 40 percent of the vote, compared with the 6 percentage point lead enjoyed by Clinton in last month‚Äôs survey, the poll showed. The margin of error was 3 percentage points in the CBS News/New York Times poll, which was conducted by telephone July 8-12 among a random sample of 1,600 adults nationwide, including 1,358 registered voters.   The survey showed 62 percent of voters surveyed distrust Trump as well. ‚ÄúBut Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs shifting and inaccurate explanations of her email practices at the State Department appear to have resonated more deeply with the electorate,‚Äù the Times wrote. FBI Director James Comey said last week Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in the handling of classified information but the investigation found no evidence she or her colleagues intended to violate laws. The Times/CBS poll echoes the finding of a Quinnipiac Poll released on Wednesday that showed Trump pulling just ahead of Clinton in the so-called swing states of Florida and Pennsylvania as the former U.S. senator and first lady lost ground on honesty and moral standards. In contrast to the New York Times/CBS News poll, a Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll released on Tuesday showed Clinton leading Trump by 13 points at a national level, with 46 percent to Trump‚Äôs 33 percent support among likely voters.

U.S. aims for start this year on buying more military satellites,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force has developed a new framework for assessing the resilience of its satellites that should allow it to start the acquisition process for more military communication and missile detection satellites this autumn, a senior official said at the Farnborough Airshow this week. Lockheed Martin, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp and Raytheon Co are keeping a close eye on these satellite programs, which could be worth billions of dollars and represent the first big new business opportunities in the military space market for some time. U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned about the need to protect their military satellites - which are critical to being able to identify targets, navigate, communicate and operate drones - given the growing use of electronic jammers and other threats. Winston Beauchamp, the U.S. Air Force deputy undersecretary for space, told Reuters that officials had developed a new set of criteria over the past year to help military leaders determine their options for more satellites. The Air Force had previously looked at the options for follow-on satellites in both programs but until now had not included specific criteria for their resilience, or their ability to operate in the face of ‚Äúhostile action or adverse conditions,‚Äù such as electromagnetic interference. Beauchamp said senior Pentagon leaders last week endorsed the work done so far on the framework and further work planned before it is presented to Defense Secretary Ash Carter for approval in the fall. Once that decision is made, the Air Force hopes to begin the long-awaited acquisition process to buy follow-on satellites for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system built by Lockheed Martin for protected satellite communications, and new missile warning satellites, also currently built by Lockheed under the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program. Work was already underway on the acquisition strategy for each of the two programs so they could begin shortly after the resilience decision this autumn, Beauchamp said. The U.S. Air Force was also focused on increasing coordination and planning among allies for its space operations, as well as more multilateral wargaming and work on developing rules of engagement and joint concepts of operations. ‚ÄúWe are thinking more broadly about how to conduct operations in a joint manner,‚Äù Beauchamp said. ‚ÄúIn the past it was tacked on at the end. But we‚Äôd like to find a way to shift the planning to the left in a number of areas.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 "
Report accuses Tennessee lawmaker of inappropriate sexual conduct,"(Reuters) - A Tennessee state lawmaker was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with 22 women over a four-year period in a state attorney general‚Äôs report released on Wednesday.  Republican Representative Jeremy Durham repeatedly made unwelcomed advances toward female legislative staff, interns and lobbyists since being elected in 2012, according to a report issued to a legislative committee investigating his conduct. Durham declined to be interviewed by investigators, the report said, and he was not immediately available for comment. ‚ÄúThe investigation has been a politically motivated, unfair and unconstitutional process,‚Äù said Durham‚Äôs attorney Bill Harbison in a statement to the Nashville CBS affiliate News Channel 5.

CIA director says he would resign if ordered to resume waterboarding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - CIA Director John Brennan said on Wednesday he would resign if the next president ordered his agency to resume waterboarding suspected militants, an apparent reference to comments by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump embracing the banned interrogation method. ‚ÄúI can say that as long as I‚Äôm director of CIA, irrespective of what the president says, I‚Äôm not going to be the director of CIA that gives that order. They‚Äôll have to find another director,‚Äù said Brennan, who did not mention Trump by name. Brennan, who has been director since 2013, tacked his comment to the end of his response to a question about drone strike policy after speaking at the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy institute.Brennan said previously he would refuse to resume the practice, which simulates drowning and was used by the CIA on three suspected militants detained in secret foreign prisons during President George W. Bush‚Äôs administration. But his pledge to resign if ordered to revive waterboarding was his most emphatic affirmation of his position to date. Trump, set to be formally nominated next week as the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has said he would reauthorize waterboarding immediately if elected, contending that ‚Äútorture works.‚Äù At an April 20 rally in Indianapolis, he recalled being asked about waterboarding during a debate the previous week. ‚ÄúThey asked me: ‚ÄòWhat do you think about waterboarding, Mr. Trump?‚Äô I said I love it. I love it, I think it‚Äôs great. And I said the only thing is, we should make it much tougher than waterboarding,‚Äù he said. Democratic President Barack Obama signed an executive order after taking office in January 2009 that banned waterboarding and other ‚Äúenhanced interrogation techniques,‚Äù or EITs. Such executive orders can be rescinded by a president‚Äôs successors. Obama, other top U.S. officials, many lawmakers and human rights groups have denounced waterboarding as torture. Some former Bush administration and CIA officials have defended waterboarding and other EITs, denying they are torture and saying they elicited valuable intelligence. Brennan told his confirmation hearing in 2013 he had not tried to stop harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding when he was at the spy agency earlier in his career, but had objected to them privately. A Senate Intelligence Committee study, issued in 2014, concluded that EITs failed to elicit any significant intelligence. Brennan said on Wednesday it was not possible to ‚Äúestablish cause and effect‚Äù between the use of EITs and the acquisition of reliable information. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "
Clinton says Trump is most divisive candidate 'in our lifetimes',"In a speech weighted with America‚Äôs complicated racial history, Democrat Hillary Clinton laced into Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on Wednesday, accusing him of fueling divisions among Americans over race and religion. ‚ÄúHis campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes,‚Äù Clinton said at a campaign appearance at the Illinois state house in Springfield. ‚ÄúIt is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American. It‚Äôs there in everything he says and everything he promises to do as president.‚Äù Clinton ticked off Trump‚Äôs proposals to ban Muslims from entering the country, create a database of Muslims already in the country and step up deportations by creating a special deportation force as policies intended to drive Americans apart. She lambasted Trump‚Äôs decision to re-tweet an image from a neo-Nazi and his statements about women. ‚ÄúWe need a president who can help pull us together, not split us apart,‚Äù Clinton said. The two presumptive nominees are heading into July nominating conventions where they are to formally become the Democratic and Republican candidates who will square off in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clinton‚Äôs speech comes a week after a sniper shot and killed five Dallas police officers during a protest of police killings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota. She addressed these incidents and other race-related deaths in Springfield. Clinton‚Äôs speech on Wednesday carried the echo of history. The state house in the Illinois capital of Springfield was the site where President Abraham Lincoln delivered an anti-slavery speech during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1858, warning that ‚Äúa house divided against itself cannot stand.‚Äù As the 16th president of the United States, he went on to guide the country through most of the Civil War. Clinton acknowledged that while ‚Äúthe challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln‚Äôs time,‚Äù the country‚Äôs ‚Äúlong struggle with race is far from finished.‚Äù  The Illinois state house is also where President Barack Obama, the first African-American to hold the highest office in America, launched his first campaign for president in 2007. Trump spent months ‚Äútrying to discredit the citizenship and legitimacy of our first black president,‚Äù Clinton said.  Trump was loudly fixated on the issue of Obama‚Äôs birthplace during the 2012 presidential campaign and had also suggested that Obama was a Muslim, despite clear evidence that the president was born in Hawaii and is a Christian. Clinton acknowledged that she has made some missteps on race. She faced early criticism from the Black Lives Matter movement for past statements, such as one in the 1990s, when she was first lady, calling violent minority youth ‚Äúsuper predators.‚Äù She told the Washington Post earlier this year that she ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have used those words.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs someone in the middle of a hotly fought political campaign I cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions haven‚Äôt sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of progress, so I recognize I have to do better, too,‚Äù she added.

Obama to sign bill to battle heroin addiction,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will sign legislation passed by Congress aimed at combating a nationwide epidemic of heroin and other opioid addictions, the White House said on Wednesday. After months of wrangling, the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday, 92-2, to pass the bill that has also been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. The measure aims to help communities develop treatment and overdose programs at a time when fewer than half the estimated 2.2 million Americans who need help for opioid abuse are receiving it, according to the U.S. Centers for Human and Health Services. The White House said in a statement the bill ‚Äúfalls far short‚Äù of the necessary funding, but Obama would sign it ‚Äúbecause some action is better than none.‚Äù Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a leading proponent of the legislation, said that it marked ‚Äúthe first time that we‚Äôve treated addiction like the disease that it is, which will help put an end to the stigma that has surrounded addiction for too long.‚Äù While its passage marked a rare bipartisan effort in this election year, Democrats complained that it does not provide  enough resources to effectively address the drug problem. ‚ÄúThis bill is like a Hollywood movie set - something that appears real on the surface but has no substance and no life behind its facade,‚Äù said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat. U.S. deaths from drug overdoses hit a record high in 2014, propelled by abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 28,000 people died from opioid overdose in 2014. At least half, HHS said, of those deaths involved a prescription opioid. Among the common prescription drugs are oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl that are used for pain treatment. Heroin-related deaths have also increased sharply, more than tripling since 2010. In 2014, more than 10,500 people died from heroin, the agency said. The bill authorizes $181 million a year for new programs it creates. Democrats said that with disagreements in Congress over next year‚Äôs funding for HHS, it was uncertain whether the money contained in the bipartisan bill actually would be delivered.  They called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, to back up this legislation with $600 million in immediate emergency funds. Obama has requested $920 million for opioid treatment programs over two years. The bill, if enacted into law, also would provide new training for emergency personnel in administering drugs to reverse opioid overdoses and help communities purchase those drugs.

House votes to bar heavy water purchases from Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to block the purchase of ‚Äúheavy water‚Äù from Iran, defying President Barack Obama‚Äôs veto threat a year after the announcement of the landmark Iran nuclear agreement. The House passed the ‚ÄúNo 2H2O from Iran Act‚Äù by 249-176, with support coming almost exclusively from Republicans, who hold a majority of seats in the chamber. Every congressional Republican, and a few of Obama‚Äôs fellow Democrats, opposed the nuclear deal between Iran and the United States and other world powers announced last July 14 in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions. They argued that Obama was so eager to bolster his foreign policy legacy that he agreed to sanctions relief Iran did not deserve because it lied about its nuclear program, supported militant groups that attack U.S. allies and perpetrated human rights abuses. Deal opponents have repeatedly introduced legislation that the administration sees as efforts to undermine the international agreement. Deal supporters said the agreement was the best way to defuse a dispute over Iran‚Äôs nuclear program that threatened further Middle East destabilization. Heavy water is a non-radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The Obama administration said in April the United States would buy $8.6 million worth of heavy water from Iran, angering Republicans who called it a subsidy of the country‚Äôs nuclear program. The White House issued a threat on Monday to veto the bill, and two others the House is due to consider later this week. Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, denied that the House measure would violate the landmark pact. He said it would deter Iran from producing heavy water by making its sale more difficult. Separately, two Senate Republicans and two Democrats said on Wednesday they would introduce their own Iran-related bill. The measure introduced by Republicans Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Marco Rubio and Democrats Robert Menendez and Joe Manchin would expand sanctions for Iran‚Äôs ballistic missile development, sanction transfers of conventional weapons to or from Iran and extend the Iran Sanctions Act. The Iran Sanctions Act, which imposed sanctions over Iran‚Äôs missile development and support for terrorism, expires at the end of 2016. Lawmakers have been in discussions for months over the best way to address its renewal. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "
U.S. judge to mull release of Trump video testimony,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said on Wednesday he would take more time to decide whether video excerpts of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump answering questions under oath about his Trump University seminars should be made public. Curiel is overseeing two class-action lawsuits in San Diego over the real estate seminar venture. A separate fraud case by New York state‚Äôs attorney general is pending. Trump has suggested Curiel is biased against him because of his campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Curiel was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent.  On Wednesday, Trump‚Äôs lawyers fought release of the videos, arguing that they would be exploited during the presidential campaign. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs all kinds of potential for mischief,‚Äù Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Trump, told Curiel.  Jason Forge, a lawyer for the students who claim they were misled and defrauded by Trump University, said Petrocelli could not point to any particular harm if the videos are released since transcripts are already public. The lawsuits accuse Trump of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 each to learn his real estate investment strategies. The students claim they learned little. Trump has claimed a majority of students were satisfied with the seminars. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "
House Republican group moves to impeach IRS chief: Politico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives has filed a measure aimed at forcing a vote to impeach Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen, a newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the plans by the House Freedom Caucus. Members of the group had told House Speaker Paul Ryan they would file a privileged resolution, effectively sidestepping leaders in the Republican-dominated chamber, if he did not agree to start impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary committee, Politico reported.  Ryan has declined to do so because of doubts the judiciary panel can make an impeachment case against Koskinen. Politico said Louisiana Representative John Fleming filed the motion. Koskinen faces allegations from the judiciary panel of ignoring congressional subpoenas and misleading lawmakers. The accusations stem from a 2013 case in which Republican lawmakers said the IRS scrutinized more conservative groups than liberal organizations in applications for tax-exempt status.

Obama plan to stop tax inversions stirs U.S. business concerns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration‚Äôs plan to prevent American companies from shifting their headquarters overseas to avoid U.S. taxes is coming under fire from companies and banks that say it would be costly and cumbersome. At issue are proposed Treasury regulations to combat ‚Äúearnings stripping,‚Äù a key goal for companies that carry out tax-avoiding mergers known as ‚Äúinversions‚Äù to reincorporate abroad, if only on paper, to cut their taxes. The practice effectively shifts taxable earnings from U.S. operations to the redomiciled former American parent as debt interest payments that are tax deductible in the United States and subject to a lower income tax rate overseas.  The Treasury Department is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the proposed changes on Thursday. The administration‚Äôs proposals, which could be finalized within months, have already dampened interest in global mergers. The proposals are backed by Democrats in Congress and academics as a responsible step to prevent corporations from exiting the U.S. tax system. Republicans say the measures overstep administration authority and could discourage foreign investment in the United States.  Businesses and trade groups representing sectors ranging from bankers and retailers to manufacturers and oil producers said a Treasury proposal to end the deductions by reclassifying the debt as equity would disrupt operations and saddle businesses with new red tape. U.S. multinational Procter & Gamble Co warned Treasury the proposed rules would require countless changes throughout its corporate structure if myriad daily loans between affiliates were recharacterized as equity investments. ‚ÄúIt will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to monitor and administer,‚Äù P&G‚Äôs Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told the Internal Revenue Service in a letter before the regulatory comment period ended last week.  He warned that the company would face pre-tax costs of $220 million to $340 million a year as a result of adverse tax consequences and burdens. The regulations would also pose challenges for intercompany loans key to the financial services industry, according to Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, which filed a joint comment with the Treasury.  ‚ÄúA financial services group would face the choice between, on the one hand, staggering administrative complexities and a tax burden disproportionate to its true economic profit, and on the other hand, the imposition of crippling constraints on its ordinary business activities,‚Äù said the banks, which seek an industry exemption. A Treasury spokeswoman said officials could respond to the feedback but added the department was moving ‚Äúswiftly‚Äù to finalize regulations. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "
Trump seeks $10 million from former adviser in campaign legal dispute,"(Reuters) - Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump is seeking $10 million in damages from a fired former employee, shedding light on a campaign that has at times seen high-profile exits and internal fights spill over into public view. Trump in May started arbitration proceedings against Sam Nunberg, a former adviser who was fired in 2015, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement, according to a court filing obtained by Reuters.     ‚ÄúHe has a confidentiality agreement which he has repeatedly breached, and we‚Äôve taken action to enforce it,‚Äù said Alan Garten, general counsel with the Trump Organization who is representing the campaign in the arbitration.  Nunberg did not respond to a request for comment. The flare-up comes after a period in which campaign in-fighting led Trump to fire some top aides, including national political director Rick Wiley and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Other staffers have separately resigned from Trump‚Äôs campaign. Trump‚Äôs legal conflicts, which also include a lawsuit over his Trump University real-estate seminars, have at times distracted public attention from his campaign. Nunberg in court documents dated Tuesday accused Trump of starting arbitration proceedings to retaliate against him for switching his support to rival presidential hopeful Ted Cruz during the Republican primaries. Cruz dropped out of the race in early May. Garten said the suit was unrelated. Nunberg also said Trump tried to use the arbitration to ‚Äúcover up media coverage of an apparent affair‚Äù between two members of his presidential campaign staff. ‚ÄúThe Trump campaign is attempting to bring a frivolous and retaliatory arbitration proceeding against me essentially to punish me and shut me up,‚Äù Nunberg said in an affidavit accompanying his petition to halt the arbitration proceedings.  The petition was filed on Tuesday in New York state court in Manhattan. The Trump campaign fired Nunberg in August 2015 after the discovery of Facebook posts that critics deemed racist. Nunberg at the time denied he wrote the posts. He said in the court filings that Trump accused him of being the source for a New York Post story in May that recounted a public argument between Lewandowski, who was then with the campaign, and Hope Hicks, Trump‚Äôs spokeswoman. In the affidavit, Nunberg said the argument was part of an ‚Äúsordid and apparently illicit affair‚Äù between the two. He denied being the source for the New York Post story, saying the argument occurred in public and others saw it. Garten called the allegation ‚Äúcategorically untrue‚Äù and said Nunberg had recently asked for his job back. ‚ÄúThis is an individual who time and time again has demonstrated that he will say anything that is outrageous, regardless of whether it‚Äôs factually accurate, to get his name out there and create trouble,‚Äù Garten said. Hicks and Lewandowski did not respond to requests for comment. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "
U.S. Senate approves bill to upgrade airport security,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday approved a bill that would upgrade security at U.S. airports in the aftermath of the Brussels and Istanbul attacks while extending funds for the Federal Aviation Administration for another 14 months. In an 89-to-4 vote, the lawmakers sent the legislation on to the White House for President Barack Obama‚Äôs signature. The House of Representatives approved the same measure on Monday. It includes provisions that require tougher vetting of aviation workers with access to secure airport areas, expedited security checks to move passengers more quickly from airport areas that are not secured and a larger number of police dogs for security duty in the U.S. transportation system. It extends the current level of federal funding for FAA programs through September 2017. Congress has been struggling to find agreement on a more comprehensive package to reauthorize the U.S. aviation regulatory agency. A measure that would have provided FAA funding over six years stalled in the House earlier this year, amid disagreement over a proposal to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system. The House later failed to take up a Senate reauthorization bill but added security features from that measure into the legislation approved this week. House Republicans say they intend to use the time between now and September 2017 to find ways to move the privatization plan forward.  A Turkish court has jailed seven suspects pending trial on terrorism charges over last month‚Äôs triple suicide bombing at Istanbul‚Äôs main airport. The attack killed 45 people. Islamic State suicide bombers killed 16 people at Brussels airport - as well as 16 on a Brussels metro train - on March 22 this year. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "
"House panel subpoenas New York, Massachusetts attorneys general","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel on Wednesday issued subpoenas to the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts to force them to submit information on their investigations into whether Exxon Mobil misled investors on climate change risks, accusing the attorneys general of having a political agenda.  The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology also subpoenaed eight environmental and legal groups. ‚ÄúThe attorneys general have appointed themselves to decide what is valid and what is invalid regarding climate change,‚Äù committee Chair Lamar Smith, a Republican of Texas, said. He said the attorneys general are pursuing a political agenda at the expense of scientists‚Äô right to free speech. The panel has demanded that state attorneys general hand over any records of consultations the prosecutors had with outside environmental groups before their probes were opened. New York and Massachusetts‚Äô top lawyers lead a coalition of 17 state attorneys general who have said they would investigate Exxon and whether its executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of global warming.    Smith and Republican members of the House panel have accused the coalition‚Äôs members of stifling free speech and scientific inquiry by those who do not believe in manmade climate change. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what we will find,‚Äù Smith told reporters. ‚ÄúWe might find an intent to intimidate.‚Äù  So far, New York and Massachusetts have issued subpoenas against Exxon Mobil, one of the world‚Äôs largest publicly traded companies.  The House committee twice demanded that the state attorneys general hand over all records of communications between their offices and outside groups about Exxon inquiries. Darin LaHood, a Republican of Illinois on the panel, said on Wednesday that the probe by the attorneys general prohibits free speech in a way ‚Äúyou would see in a third world country.‚Äù Cyndi Roy Gonzalez, the spokeswoman for the Massachusetts attorney general‚Äôs office, said in a statement that Smith‚Äôs committee has no right to interfere with ‚Äú... a state inquiry into whether a private company violated state laws, and we will continue to fight any and all efforts to stop our investigation.‚Äù Green groups Greenpeace and 350.org made similar criticisms in a letter to Smith. Exxon, which has said that it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years, called the subpoena unreasonably burdensome and intrusive. It also raised questioned about jurisdiction.

Trump pulls just ahead in two key U.S. states: poll,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump pulled ahead of Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton in Florida and Pennsylvania in a Quinnipiac Poll released on Wednesday that included responses after the FBI released its findings on Clinton‚Äôs email use. Clinton lost ground on honesty and moral standards in the poll that showed tight races in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, all swing states that could go to either party in November‚Äôs presidential election. The Quinnipiac Poll, taken from June 30 to July 11, showed Trump competitive in the three states a week before the start of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that will formally nominate him as the party‚Äôs presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election. Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the poll, said there was no definite link between Clinton‚Äôs drop in Florida from Quinnipiac‚Äôs June 21 survey and the FBI‚Äôs findings that she was careless in her handling of government emails while U.S. secretary of state. But he said Clinton lost ground to Trump on questions that measure moral standards and honesty. Clinton lost an 8-point lead in Florida, where Trump won 42 percent to Clinton‚Äôs 39 percent, according to the Quinnipiac Poll. In Ohio, the poll showed the candidates tied at 41 percent.  In Pennsylvania, the Quinnipiac poll showed Trump with 43 percent to Clinton‚Äôs 41 percent. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released this week showed a very different result in Pennsylvania, with Clinton leading Trump 45 to 36 percent. The July 5-10 poll included 829 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points. Nationally, Clinton leads Trump by 13 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. The online poll showed that 46 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 33 percent support Trump. The July 8-12 included 1,146 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. FBI Director James Comey said last week Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in the handling of classified information but the investigation found no evidence she or her colleagues intended to violate laws. Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, has faced heavy criticism from Republicans for her use of private email servers for government business while she led the State Department from 2009 to 2013. The Quinnipiac poll was conducted by telephone with people who identified as registered voters. It included 1,015 people in Florida, 955 people in Ohio and 982 people in Pennsylvania. The margin of error was around three percentage points in all three states. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 "

"Responding to criticism, Trump calls on Justice Ginsburg to resign","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential contender Donald Trump called on Wednesday for the resignation of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, describing her as mentally unfit after she lambasted him in a series of media interviews. ‚ÄúJustice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me,‚Äù Trump said in a Twitter post. ‚ÄúHer mind is shot - resign!‚Äù  The New York billionaire chided Ginsburg, 83, for criticizing him this week and expressing concern for the country‚Äôs future if he is elected in November. Trump said it was inappropriate for Supreme Court justices to weigh in on political campaigns. He told the New York Times on Tuesday that he thought it was a disgrace to the court and that Ginsburg should apologize to her colleagues on the bench.  Trump was not alone in the rebuke. In an editorial on Wednesday, the New York Times urged Ginsburg to uphold the court‚Äôs tradition of silence in political campaigns. ‚ÄúJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg needs to drop the political punditry and the name-calling,‚Äù the editorial said.  The Times said there was no legal requirement that Supreme Court justices keep silent on political campaigns, but it expressed concern that Ginsburg would jeopardize her own commitment to impartiality. Ginsburg was not immediately available for comment on Trump‚Äôs remarks and the editorial. In a CNN interview posted on Tuesday, Ginsburg called Trump ‚Äúa faker.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe has no consistency about him,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe says whatever comes into his head at the moment.

New Black Panther Party says to carry arms in Cleveland if legal,"(Reuters) - The New Black Panther Party, a ‚Äúblack power‚Äù movement, will carry firearms for self-defense during rallies in Cleveland ahead of next week‚Äôs Republican convention, if allowed under Ohio law, the group‚Äôs chairman said.  The plan by the group this weekend comes as police in Cleveland brace for an influx of groups that plan demonstrations before and during the presidential nominating convention.  During the attack last week in Dallas that killed five police officers, law enforcement officials said demonstrators carrying rifles led them to initially believe they were under attack by multiple shooters. Several other groups, including some supporters of¬†presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have said they will carry weapons in Cleveland. ‚ÄúIf it is an open state to carry, we will exercise our second amendment rights because there are other groups threatening to be there that are threatening to do harm to us,‚Äù Hashim Nzinga, chairman of the New Black Panther Party, told Reuters in a telephone interview.¬†  ‚ÄúIf that state allows us to bear arms, the Panthers and the others who can legally bear arms will bear arms.‚Äù Nzinga said he condemned the Dallas shootings. Officials in Ohio have said it will be legal for protesters to carry weapons at demonstrations outside the convention under that state‚Äôs ‚Äúopen carry‚Äù law, which allows civilians to carry guns in public.  ‚ÄúBlack power‚Äù groups promote defense against racial oppression, with some advocating for the establishment of armed self-defense groups, black social institutions and a self-sufficient economy. The New Black Panther Party has long called for a separate black nation. But Nzinga said the movement was now focused on protecting black Americans‚Äô rights. Academics say the New Black Panther Party remains marginal and largely representative of an older generation, in their 30s and 40s, rather than younger activists drawn to groups such as the anti-racism Black Lives Matter movement. The New Black Panther Party was founded in 1989 and adopted a more radical approach than the 1960s Black Panther Party. Members of the original group have denounced the New Black Panther Party as racist, but Nzinga says his movement includes original Black Panthers. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group watchdog, describes the New Black Panther Party as ‚Äúa virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.‚Äù The center tracks years of public statements by the New Black Panther Party and other groups. Nzinga denied the group was racist but said it was a fact that Jews control Hollywood and the U.S. media. The center said the group is not known to have carried out any violent attacks. The black shooter in the Dallas killings ‚Äúliked‚Äù the New Black Panthers and other black nationalist groups on Facebook but was not a member.   Nzinga said he expected ‚Äúa couple hundred‚Äù members of the New Black Panther Party to participate in and protect a black unity rally ‚Äî the ‚ÄúNational Convention of the Oppressed‚Äù ‚Äî that is scheduled to begin in Cleveland on Thursday evening and end on Monday morning. Nzinga said he and the Panthers plan to leave Cleveland on Sunday, the day before the convention officially opens.  ‚ÄúWe are there to protect ... We are not trying to do anything else,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are going to carry out some of¬†these great legal rights we have ‚Äî to assemble, to protest and (to exercise) freedom of speech.‚Äù Nzinga says his group has grown amid racial tensions in the wake of a series of high-profile police killings of black men in the past two years. The Southern Poverty Law Center says the number of black militant chapters around the country grew from 113 in 2014 to 180 in 2015.  The center says there are 892 hate groups total nationwide. It says white hate groups, such as the Aryan Brotherhood, have a much longer track record of carrying out violent attacks than black nationalist groups. Nzinga said his group has 36 chapters nationwide but declined to reveal membership numbers. ‚ÄúI have people literally calling me saying this is the first time in my life I protested and I loved it.‚Äù Nzinga told Reuters. ‚ÄúThey want to be a part of something. They tried to be a part of the system and the system let them down so they want to be part of a rebellion.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 "
Clinton extends lead over Trump to 13 points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton extended her lead over Republican rival Donald Trump to 13 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday, up from 10 points at the end of last week. The July 8-12 poll showed 46 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, the former secretary of state, while 33 percent supported Trump, a celebrity real estate developer. Another 21 percent did not support either candidate. That compared with 45 percent who supported Clinton and 35 percent who supported Trump in the five days to July 8.  Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has mostly led in the national online poll this year. The last time Trump came close to Clinton‚Äôs popularity was in early May, when his last two rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out of the race and party leaders started to line up behind his campaign. Trump, who is expected to become the official Republican nominee at the party‚Äôs convention next week, has since lost ground in the poll as he struggled to refocus his campaign from the Republican nominating contests to the Nov. 8 general election.  Over the past several weeks, Trump has faced criticism for his past business dealings and has quarreled with Republican leaders over his rejection of international trade agreements and his promises to crack down on immigration. Clinton, meanwhile, has been dogged by criticisms of how she handled classified information as secretary of state.  James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said last week that Clinton and her staff were ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù with sensitive information but recommended that the government not seek criminal charges against her.  Still, Americans have become increasingly positive about Clinton this month, with half of likely voters now saying they have a favorable view of her, according to the poll, up from 46 percent on July 1. Some 60 percent of likely voters have an unfavorable view of Trump, compared with 58 percent on July 1.

Clinton vetting retired U.S. Navy Admiral Stavridis for VP: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign is vetting retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis as a potential vice presidential running mate, a source with knowledge of the process told Reuters on Tuesday. Stavridis is dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University near Boston and a former supreme allied commander of NATO.  ‚ÄúAdmiral Stavridis is one of the finest military officers of his generation,‚Äù Michele Flournoy, a former under secretary at the U.S. Department of Defense, told Reuters in a statement. ‚ÄúHe is a person of great ability and integrity, and an exceptional leader. He has the talents, experience, judgment and temperament to serve the American people at the highest levels of our government.‚Äù The Clinton campaign declined to comment on the vetting of Stavridis. Stavridis likewise declined to comment on the process. Flournoy, who formed a think tank after leaving the Defense Department and is advising the Clinton campaign on foreign policy, also did not comment on the vetting process. Flournoy is thought to be a probable Clinton pick for defense secretary if the presumptive Democratic nominee wins the White House on Nov. 8. Stavridis and Clinton worked closely together when he was at NATO and she led the U.S. State Department during Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs first term. Introducing Clinton at a 2013 awards dinner, Stavridis said, ‚ÄúShe does the work of two, of 20, of 200 with her energy, with her enthusiasm and with her boundless determination to improve our world,‚Äù and praised her use of ‚Äúsmart power.‚Äù In a 2012 TED talk on global security, Stavridis began by saying: ‚ÄúMy thesis for us today is, instead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges.‚Äù Clinton has used similar rhetoric about the role of international diplomacy on the campaign trail. Stravidis was senior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in the George W. Bush administration during the early years of the U.S. occupation of Iraq. That could provide presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with a line of political attack.  Trump has throughout the campaign criticized Clinton for, as a U.S. senator, voting in favor of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Trump expressed early concerns about the operation‚Äôs cost. Another political millstone could be a 2012 Defense Department inspector general‚Äôs report that said Stavridis had failed to obtain prior authorization to use a government aircraft during an unofficial trip and submitted improper travel expenses. Stavridis was cleared of misconduct. Stavridis would bring military heft to Clinton‚Äôs presidential ticket. Trump is considering Michael Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for the No. 2 spot. Flynn, a Democrat who is nonetheless fiercely critical of Obama‚Äôs foreign policy, would be an unconventional choice for Trump. The wealthy New York businessman is formally vetting former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Indiana Governor Mike Pence.  Other potential vice presidential picks said to be on Clinton‚Äôs short list are U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tim Kaine of Virginia, according to news reports. Clinton campaigned alongside Warren in Ohio last month and is set to campaign with Kaine in his home state on Thursday. Her campaign has not confirmed that either is being formally vetted.

Puerto Rico's fiscal challenges not over: governor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Puerto Rico, the U.S. commonwealth that recently declared a historic default, could be shut out of debt markets for two more years as it battles with fiscal challenges, the island‚Äôs governor said on Tuesday. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said emergency fiscal measures in response to a $70 billion debt were not sustainable and that ‚ÄúPuerto Rico will not endure any more austerity.‚Äù   He said a new law enacted by Washington allowing the federal government to appoint a control board would undercut self-government, but added it would help the island confront its fiscal problems. ‚ÄúOur challenges are not over and prosperity will not return overnight,‚Äù the governor said during a discussion at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington. ‚ÄúIt will take maybe two years until the market opens back to Puerto Rico if we do the right thing,‚Äù Garcia Padilla said, adding the government had been producing fiscally sound budgets that would help win back creditors. The island has been shut out of debt markets for about a year. Citing falling debt levels, he said it was a ‚Äúmoment of opportunity‚Äù in Puerto Rico, which has struggled with high debt loads and a weak economy for years.  Puerto Rico defaulted on $779 million of constitutionally backed debt on July 1, among its most senior bonds, opting to pay for essential services for its citizens over obligations to creditors.  Garcia Padilla said the Puerto Rican government would take steps on its own to get its fiscal affairs in order, therefore minimizing meddling by the oversight board. For example, he said that if the island‚Äôs government passed responsible budgets on its own, the control board would not need to impose its own fiscal plans. Garcia Padilla said, however, that while the government must become more efficient to improve its fiscal situation, that should be done through attrition rather than laying off workers. Asked by a reporter about steps that could be taken to shore up the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, or PRASA, Garcia Padilla said: ‚ÄúPREPA is pretty advanced. We‚Äôll be able to reduce a lot the debt related to PREPA. We want to do the same with PRASA. I think we‚Äôll be able to do it.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 "
U.S. Senate votes to hammer out deal with House on energy measure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to work on a compromise with the House of Representatives on what could become the broad energy legislation passed by Congress in nearly a decade.  The Senate voted 84 to 3 to go to formal conference with the House on legislation to take modest steps on modernizing the power grid, speeding the permitting of exports of liquefied natural gas, and increasing research and funding for energy efficiency and batteries.  Congress is slated to begin summer recess on Friday and the conference is expected to work on the compromise energy legislation after returning in September. Senators who will work with House lawmakers on a deal in conference include Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the chamber.   The Senate energy bill passed in April, while the House energy bill passed last year.  Lawmakers in the House have removed items such as limits on energy efficiency that the White House has said Obama would veto. Among items to be worked out between the two chambers will be the speed of LNG export permitting process. The Senate version of the bill limits federal reviews to 45 days while the House version limits them to 30 days.  ‚ÄúMy objective here is to deliver a law,‚Äù Senator Lisa Murkowski, the chairman of the Senate energy committee, said about the conference process, shortly before the measure passed. Before becoming a law, an agreement worked out in conference would have to be passed by both chambers and signed by Obama.  Industry group the American Petroleum Institute praised the step, saying the bill would boost U.S. energy infrastructure and ensure ‚Äúthat American natural gas has a dominant place on the world market.‚Äù Environmental group the League of Conservation Voters welcomed progress on the debate on energy efficiency but warned that some of the potential measures to be discussed in conference ‚Äúwill not amount to the true overhaul our energy sector needs.‚Äù Meanwhile, the House of Representatives debated a bill to fund the Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency. The White House on Monday said Obama would veto that measure if it passes because it ‚Äúunderfunds‚Äù key Department of Interior programs and slashes the EPA‚Äôs operating budget.

Clinton gets Sanders endorsement in show of party unity,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (Reuters) - Democrat Bernie Sanders endorsed former rival Hillary Clinton for president in a display of party unity on Tuesday, describing her as the best candidate to fix the United States‚Äô problems and beat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. With Clinton nodding in agreement beside him, Sanders put aside their bitter campaign for the Democratic nomination and said she would take up the fight to ease economic inequality, make college more affordable and expand healthcare coverage for all Americans. ‚ÄúThis campaign is about the needs of the American people and addressing the very serious crises that we face, and there is no doubt in my mind that, as we head into November, Hillary Clinton is far and away the best candidate to do that,‚Äù he told a raucous crowd in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, that included plenty of vocal Sanders supporters. ‚ÄúI intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States,‚Äù the U.S. senator from Vermont said. His endorsement, five weeks after Clinton became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, brought the most prominent holdout in the party‚Äôs liberal wing into her camp. Sanders threw Clinton his support less than two weeks before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where she is to be formally nominated. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help but reflect on how much more enjoyable this election will be now that we are on the same side,‚Äù Clinton said of Sanders. ‚ÄúThank you, Bernie, for your endorsement, but more than that, thank you for your lifetime of fighting injustice.‚Äù Trump ridiculed the move in a series of Twitter posts, saying Sanders had abandoned the supporters who flocked to his insurgent campaign to rein in Wall Street and get big money out of politics. ‚ÄúBernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs,‚Äù Trump said on Twitter.  In a statement, the Trump campaign said Sanders was now officially part of the rigged system the senator had criticized during his long primary battle with Clinton. ‚ÄúBernie‚Äôs endorsement becomes Exhibit A in our rigged system - the Democrat Party is disenfranchising its voters to benefit the select and privileged few,‚Äù said Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to Trump. In a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday, Clinton extended her lead over Trump to 13 percentage points, up from 10 points at the end of last week. The former U.S. secretary of state hopes the Portsmouth appearance with Sanders will help her win over his supporters, some of whom held Sanders signs at the rally and chanted his name. In recent Reuters/Ipsos polling, only about 40 percent of Sanders backers said they would back Clinton, and the crowd at Tuesday‚Äôs rally made it clear she still had work to do. ‚ÄúI am absolutely certain I will not vote for Hillary Clinton,‚Äù said Gale Bailey, a Sanders supporter and an unemployed graphic designer from Rochester, New Hampshire, who attended the rally in a Sanders T-shirt. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a crook, and I‚Äôm not going to vote for a crook,‚Äù Bailey said, adding that she would write in Sanders‚Äô name on the November ballot. The joint appearance concluded weeks of negotiations between the two camps as Sanders pressed for concessions from Clinton on his liberal policy agenda. It came after Clinton last week adopted elements of Sanders‚Äô plans for free in-state college tuition and expanded affordable healthcare coverage. Sanders also successfully pushed to include an array of liberal policy positions in the Democratic platform, which a committee approved on Saturday. Sanders did not win all of his policy fights, most notably failing to win support for blocking a congressional vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. But he told the Portsmouth rally that ‚Äúour job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratically controlled Senate, a Democratically controlled House and a Hillary Clinton presidency ‚Äì and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen.‚Äù In an email to supporters after the rally, Sanders said he would still push for changes to the party‚Äôs nominating process to make it more inclusive. In the months ahead, he will campaign around the country for progressive congressional candidates, he said. Also on Tuesday, a source with knowledge of the process said the Clinton campaign is vetting James Stavridis, a retired four-star Navy admiral, as a potential vice presidential running mate. Stavridis, who served as supreme allied commander at NATO, is currently dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.  Top Democrats, including President Barack Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the party‚Äôs liberal wing, have already announced their support for Clinton, leaving Sanders at risk of being left behind in the Democratic battle against Trump. ‚ÄúI think all signs point to the fact that we‚Äôre going to have a very united party going into Philadelphia,‚Äù Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on CNN earlier on Tuesday, ‚Äúand when you compare it to the Republicans, we‚Äôre going to be miles ahead of them.‚Äù  Trump has struggled to unify the Republican Party after alienating many establishment figures with his stances on immigration, Muslims and women. A number of prominent Republicans are skipping the party‚Äôs convention in Cleveland next week. ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 "
"U.S. Congress shrugs off guns, Zika as summer break nears","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is headed for a seven-week recess without addressing gun violence, the Zika virus outbreak and other pressing issues, amid persistent election-year bickering. Despite recent gun violence, the House of Representatives will not vote this week on a proposal to keep firearms out of the hands of people on terrorism watch lists, that chamber‚Äôs Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday. Similarly, President Barack Obama‚Äôs request for $1.9 billion in funds to combat the Zika virus and the birth defects it can cause has been stalled in Congress since February. Republicans and Democrats were also at odds over spending bills to keep the government functioning beyond Sept. 30, when current fiscal year funding expires. When Republicans took control of Congress, they vowed to get things done but have had difficulty doing so during this election year, failing to pass a budget or even consider Obama‚Äôs nomination of Merrick Garland to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. Congress did, however, approve bipartisan legislation helping Puerto Rico out of a crippling debt crisis and is trying to make progress on legislation to improve police relations with local communities in the aftermath of gun violence. With barely four days left before the start of an unusually long recess, a failure to vote on guns would postpone any possible action by the House until at least Sept. 6, when lawmakers return. After that, they will work only for short stints ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections. Mass shootings in Orlando and Dallas, and gun violence in other cities, has again propelled gun control to prominence. But the National Rifle Association and its allies in Congress so far have staved off legislation. Gun control is generally opposed by Republicans and supported by Democrats. Some Republicans have talked about a gun bill possibly moving through Congress in the fall, in the midst of the campaign season, but Democrats were skeptical. ‚ÄúThis Congress will do nothing on curbing gun violence,‚Äù Representative Xavier Becerra of California, a member of the House Democratic leadership, told reporters. The two sides even disagree on whether House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi talked about a proposal to establish a special committee to study gun violence. Democrats say Pelosi raised the issue with Ryan last week. Ryan‚Äôs office says he has never discussed the topic with anyone. Republicans in the House and Senate have signed onto a $1.1 billion Zika funding bill. But Democrats are balking over what they see as ‚Äúpoison pills‚Äù attached to the money that would deny funds to women‚Äôs healthcare provider Planned Parenthood and ease some environmental provisions. Democrats, who warn the current legislation will not pass the Senate, said on Tuesday that they offered to accept some Republican provisions. But Senate Republicans insist the bill cannot be altered.  Ryan meanwhile showcased his ‚ÄúA Better Way‚Äù agenda, flashing a glossy pamphlet at a press conference listing proposals designed to lure votes in November but do nothing this year legislatively. Republicans have also pushed for new federal probes of Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, on her use of private emails while secretary of state.

U.S. attorney general deflects lawmakers' questions on Clinton emails,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. law enforcement official, under questioning from Republicans at a congressional hearing on Tuesday, shed no new light on the Justice Department‚Äôs decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton over her handling of sensitive emails. Attorney General Loretta Lynch deflected questions about the department‚Äôs inquiry into Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email system while she was secretary of state, an issue that has hounded her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Republicans grilled Lynch at the House of Representatives committee hearing over Justice‚Äôs decision not to charge Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúLynch has no intention of answering ... even the most basic questions about the legal elements the government is obligated to prove in a criminal prosecution,‚Äù said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican. Democratic lawmakers at the hearing largely avoided the subject, asking Lynch about gun control and policing reforms.  Lynch referred questions about the department‚Äôs decision to an FBI-led investigative team that recommended not bringing charges. She said she was ‚Äúextremely proud‚Äù of the team‚Äôs work, testifying one week after the FBI closed its year-long probe. The emails case is a favorite target for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, as well as other Republican politicians. Goodlatte and Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz asked the Justice Department on Monday to investigate whether Clinton committed perjury in testimony to Congress about the emails. Other investigations continue. At least one federal judge is seeking to establish whether Clinton set up the email system to thwart laws governing the public‚Äôs access to official records. Judge Emmet Sullivan of the district court in Washington, who is overseeing a lawsuit accusing the State Department of not complying with records requests by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, is considering whether to order that Clinton give testimony about the system under oath.  Clinton‚Äôs lawyers argued against her having to testify in court papers filed on Tuesday, saying she had no more information to provide that was not already in the public record and that the Justice Department still had her emails and computer equipment. Judge Sullivan is due to rule on whether to order the deposition after a hearing next Monday. FBI Director James Comey told a congressional hearing last week he recommended against charging Clinton because there was insufficient evidence that she acted with bad intent. He added that any of his employees who handled emails the way Clinton did could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance. ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 "
Former Illinois Governor Blagojevich seeks reduced prison sentence,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Former two-term Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich is seeking a drastically reduced sentence that would see him released from federal prison within a year after convictions in 2011 for corruption charges including extortion and wire fraud, according to U.S. court documents. Federal prosecutors countered, recommending in documents filed just before a midnight Tuesday deadline that Blagojevich serve out his original 14-year sentence, of which he has served more than four years. The motions come ahead of a scheduled resentencing on Aug. 9 before U.S. District Judge James Zagel after an appellate court last year vacated five of Blagojevich‚Äôs 18 criminal convictions. Prosecutors declined to retry the ex-governor on the vacated convictions. Blagojevich, a Democrat, was the first Illinois governor to be removed from office and has been in federal prison in Colorado since 2012. The former governor was convicted on charges including seeking money in exchange for an appointment to the senate seat formerly held by President Barack Obama. His attorneys argued in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois that the flamboyant former U.S. House Representative has made efforts toward restitution, tutoring fellow prison inmates and playing in a band with a since-released inmate called the Jailhouse Rockers. They said that Blagojevich‚Äôs release from prison early would allow him to repair his relationship with his wife and two daughters. ‚ÄúA sentence in the neighborhood of five years incarceration accompanied by a period of supervised release would be sufficient,‚Äù Blagojevich attorney Leonard Goodman said in a filing. U.S. prosecutors argued that Blagojevich should serve out the entire sentence as he still does not take responsibility for his illegal actions. ‚Äú(Blagojevich‚Äôs) continued insistence that he lacked intent to commit the crimes of which he was convicted further demonstrates a complete lack of acceptance,‚Äù they said.

"For Chinese officials, Trump perhaps better the devil they don't know","BEIJING (Reuters) - In 2010, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provoked outrage in Beijing when she pushed the South China Sea to the top of the regional and U.S. security agendas. Now as an international court prepares to hand down a ruling that threatens China‚Äôs sweeping claims in the vital waterway, Beijing is watching Clinton‚Äôs presidential run with trepidation.  Combined with her tough line on human rights and role in leading President Barack Obama‚Äôs Asia ‚Äúrebalancing‚Äù, Clinton is well-known in China - but not well liked.  While presidential rival Donald Trump has irritated Beijing with comments such as comparing the U.S. trade deficit with China to rape, he is largely an unknown quantity, a person who even privately officials shrug their shoulders over. ‚ÄúClinton will be a difficult partner,‚Äù one senior Chinese diplomatic source told Reuters, having just admitted to not knowing much about Trump or what he stands for.   Chinese diplomats take some comfort that Clinton‚Äôs views are known to them from years of high-level contacts, from her days as first lady to her Senate tenure to her time as secretary of state. But they are also mindful that even while seeking diplomatic accommodations, she has been a staunch critic of Beijing on a range of issues, including the South China Sea, trade and human rights. China remembers clearly a 2010 Southeast Asian security summit in Hanoi, when Clinton waded into the South China Sea dispute, saying open access and legal solutions were a U.S. ‚Äúnational interest‚Äù and ‚Äúpivotal to regional security‚Äù. In a strongly worded response, China stressed the South China Sea as one of its ‚Äúcore interests‚Äù, putting the issue up there with Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang in terms of its importance to Beijing. China warned its rival claimants and neighbors not to be emboldened by U.S. support - a line it has repeated ever since. An arbitration court hearing the dispute between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea is set to hand down its ruling on in the Dutch city of The Hague on Tuesday. Legal experts expect at least some substantive findings to go against China, which has vowed to ignore the ruling. China‚Äôs military, which is ramping up its presence in the South China Sea as part of a major modernization program, is also watching the election closely.          ‚ÄúHillary is very fierce when it comes to China,‚Äù a Chinese official close to the military establishment told Reuters. While the Chinese government has been largely quiet about the U.S. election, state media has not been so restrained, with one paper even equating Trump to Hitler.  In May, China‚Äôs official Xinhua news agency noted Trump‚Äôs more isolationist campaign compared to Clinton‚Äôs, who it described as an ‚Äúold foreign policy hand‚Äù and important backer of the Asia-Pacific ‚Äúpivot‚Äù that China considers a threat. ‚ÄúAs far as she‚Äôs concerned, being tough on foreign policy is perhaps the best way to show America‚Äôs so called ‚Äòleadership‚Äô,‚Äù it said in a commentary. Laura Rosenberger, a Clinton campaign foreign policy adviser who worked with her in the State Department, told Reuters Clinton would remain tough on the South China Sea issue. ‚ÄúShe believes that we need to be very strong in terms of standing up to many of the actions the Chinese have taken,‚Äù Rosenberger said. ‚ÄúShe believes in the principles of freedom of navigation in international waters, that commerce on the high seas in incredibly important to the United States, and that these are really very direct interests that we need to continue to stand up for.‚Äù Trump adviser Peter Navarro, an economist at University of California Irvine and the author of the book, ‚ÄúCrouching Tiger: What China‚Äôs Militarism Means for the World,‚Äù said a Trump presidency would lead to respect. ‚ÄúThe central difference between a Trump administration and the current administration or a Clinton administration is respect. The leaders of Russia, the leaders of China will respect Mr. Trump, will respect America because we will be strong economically, militarily and politically.‚Äù Trump may actually find some sympathy in China, even if he is seen as an unknown quantity.  ‚ÄúWho is Trump? We don‚Äôt really know. We do know he hates Muslims though - and that will be well received in some circles here,‚Äù said the Chinese official with ties to the military, pointing to what China views as its war on terror in its Muslim-populated far western region of Xinjiang. China also views Trump as a businessmen with whom they can probably negotiate. ‚ÄúIt would be very transactional for the Chinese,‚Äù said a senior Western diplomat in Beijing. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a businessman they think they‚Äôll be able to strike a deal with.‚Äù Trump may also be less tough on China over human rights than Clinton, who has frequently clashed with Beijing on the issue.  In 2011, Clinton said China was on a ‚Äúfool‚Äôs errand‚Äù to try to halt the march of freedom, while in 2012 she was deeply involved in efforts to get blind dissident Chen Guangcheng out of China after he fled to the U.S. embassy in Beijing.  Trump advisor Navarro said Clinton‚Äôs record on human rights abuse was ‚Äúsketchy at best and abysmal at worst‚Äù, highlighting her first trip to Asia as Secretary of State in 2009, where other issues were given priority. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs difficult to see how she would have someone would view her as credible on that issue.‚Äù  Rosenberger, the Clinton adviser, rejected that view, highlighting comments from Trump in a 1990 interview referring to the ‚Äústrength‚Äù of the Chinese government in its bloody crackdown of student-led protests in Tiananmen Square a year earlier. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ironic for Trump‚Äôs adviser to criticize Hillary‚Äôs statement there when Trump himself has actually praised the Chinese for the Tiananmen massacre,‚Äù Rosenberger said.  Still, China is hoping that whoever wins they will understand that both countries need each other and will have to work closely, a source with ties to the Chinese leadership told Reuters, requesting anonymity. ‚ÄúIt is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. China needs the United States and vice versa,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know who will be the lesser of two evils.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 "
House chairmen seek new federal probe of Clinton testimony,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairmen of two U.S. House of Representatives committees asked the Justice Department on Monday to launch an investigation into whether Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton committed perjury during testimony to Congress about her use of a private email server. ‚ÄúThe evidence collected by the FBI during its investigation of Secretary Clinton‚Äôs use of a personal email system appears to directly contradict several aspects of her sworn testimony‚Äù to Congress, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said in a letter to U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips requesting the probe. After a year-long investigation of Clinton‚Äôs emails, the FBI recommended that no criminal charges be brought against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. That recommendation was accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The FBI found, however, that she was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù while secretary of state in her handling of email documents that contained classified information.

Prospects for House vote on gun control measure dims,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prospects dimmed on Monday for the U.S. House of Representatives to vote this week on Republican legislation to restrict gun sales to suspected extremists before Congress goes on a seven-week summer break.  Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan have been under pressure to act on gun legislation since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Congress begins a summer recess on Friday. But with the House floor schedule filling with other bills, Republicans said gun legislation was unlikely to come up before September, when prospects for serious action could be overshadowed by the fall presidential election campaign.   Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said, ‚ÄúI do not anticipate that bill.‚Äù The measure, backed by the National Rifle Association, would give government authorities three days to convince a judge to block the sale of weapons to someone suspected of involvement in violent extremism. But Ryan has been unable to win support from conservative Republicans who say the measure poses potential constitutional problems and should be subjected to regular legislative channels including formal hearings. Republican lawmakers say discussions aimed at finding compromise are continuing. But the measure did not come up at a Monday meeting with Republican leaders to discuss the week‚Äôs agenda, said another lawmaker who predicted it would not see a vote this week.   The stalemate leaves hanging Democratic demands for stronger gun restrictions, despite an unprecedented 25-hour sit-in by House Democrats last month, and sidelines any potential movement on an alternative bipartisan bill seen as a possible compromise. ‚ÄúA vote is going to be stalled‚Äù until Congress returns from its long summer break, one Republican aide said. Lawmakers initially believed Congress could pass some kind of measure before their summer recess after the Orlando shootings raised national security concerns and polls showed a majority of Americans in favor of greater restrictions.

U.S. House approves bill to upgrade airport security,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives on Monday approved an aviation bill that would upgrade security at U.S. airports in the aftermath of the Brussels and Istanbul attacks while extending funds for the Federal Aviation Administration for another 14 months. The approval, by a simple voice vote, sends the legislation to the Senate, where lawmakers were expected to approve the measure and forward it to the White House for President Barack Obama‚Äôs signature before Congress leaves for a seven-week summer break on Friday. The measure includes provisions from an earlier Senate bill that require tougher vetting of aviation workers with access to secure airport areas, expedited security checks to move passengers more quickly from airport areas that are not secured and a larger number of police dogs for security duty in the U.S. transportation system. It extends the current level of federal funding for FAA programs through September 2017. Congress has been struggling to find agreement on a more comprehensive package to reauthorize the U.S. aviation regulatory agency. A measure that would have provided FAA funding over six years stalled in the House earlier this year, amid disagreement over a proposal to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system. House Republicans say they intend to use the time between now and September 2017 to find ways to move the privatization plan forward.  ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 "
Obama renews call for U.S. public health insurance option,"(Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday urged Congress to reconsider offering a government-run health insurance option alongside private plans on the exchanges created as part of his national healthcare law.  In an article published in the online edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Obama said the Affordable Care Act had made much progress toward improving access to healthcare and the quality and affordability of care.  Many Republicans fiercely oppose the law saying it has raised health coverage costs for Americans and have tried repeatedly to repeal it in Congress    Obama said several challenges remain.  ‚ÄúNow, based on experience with the ACA, I think Congress should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of the country where competition is limited,‚Äù the president wrote.     Public programs like Medicare often deliver care more cost effectively by curtailing administrative overhead and securing better prices from providers, Obama said. Republicans and some Democrats opposed the inclusion of a government-run plan similar to Medicare in the original Obamacare law, and the so-called ‚Äúpublic option‚Äù did not make it into the final legislation.   Since the ACA became law, the uninsured rate has declined  to 9.1 percent in 2015 from 16 percent in 2010. Most enrollees live in counties with at least three policy issuers, which helps keep down costs, Obama said. However, 12 percent of those enrolled in plans through the exchanges live in areas with only one or two issuers. Adding a public plan in such areas would give consumers more affordable options, he said. Obama also called on Congress to increase financial assistance to purchase coverage, which he said would help middle class families who are stilling struggling with premiums. Obama said spending on prescription drugs, which rose 12 percent in 2014, remains a problem, and he urged Congress to act on his proposal to increase transparency around manufacturers‚Äô production and development costs. He said the federal government should be given the authority to negotiate prices for certain high-priced drugs. Last month, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled a plan to overhaul the nation‚Äôs healthcare system that would keep some of Obamacare‚Äôs more popular provisions, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parents‚Äô coverage until age 26. The proposal, which is not formal legislation, is part of a broader effort by House Speaker Paul Ryan to offer a Republican agenda ahead of the Nov. 8 elections.  ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 "
"A year later, U.S. lawmakers still take aim at Iran nuclear deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers this week will consider three Republican-backed measures targeting the Obama administration‚Äôs nuclear agreement with Iran, which bitterly divides Washington a year after it was announced and could play a role in November‚Äôs elections. One bill would impose new sanctions on Iran over any sponsorship of terrorism or human rights violations. Another would bar the purchase from Iran of ‚Äúheavy water,‚Äù a non-radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The third would block Iran‚Äôs access to the U.S. financial system, including the use of the dollar. Republican lawmakers, who control the House of Representatives and Senate and unanimously opposed the nuclear deal announced last July 14, have said the measures are necessary to send Iran a strong message that it will face consequences if it violates international agreements. Many, joined by several Democrats, have been especially concerned by Iran‚Äôs actions since the deal was officially implemented in January, including its test-firing of ballistic missiles in March. ‚ÄúIt makes sense to do all we can to check this very dangerous Iranian activity,‚Äù Republican Representative Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told the Rules Committee, which sets up rules for debate of bills headed to the House floor. Thanks in part to the nuclear agreement, Iran has begun to rejoin global politics and economics after more than three decades of isolation. Business and political leaders are visiting the country, which is also hosting trade conferences. In his first report on the deal, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Iran‚Äôs ballistic missile launches ‚Äúare not consistent with the constructive spirit‚Äù of the nuclear deal. He said it was up to the U.N. Security Council to decide if the launches violated the resolution backing the agreement. However, he also said he was ‚Äúencouraged by Iran‚Äôs implementation of its nuclear commitments.‚Äù Republicans worry that President Barack Obama is so eager to preserve the pact as a legacy that his administration will give Tehran too much leeway before he leaves office in January. ELECTION-YEAR POLITICS? Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, backs the nuclear deal. Republican candidate Donald Trump has promised to tear it up if he is elected on Nov. 8. Most of Obama‚Äôs fellow Democrats in Congress backed the agreement. They say the new legislation is intended to undermine or even derail it. The White House issued a threat on Monday to veto all three bills, saying they would affect the continued viability of the nuclear agreement. The deal ‚Äúis critical to ensuring that Iran‚Äôs nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States and the international community,‚Äù it said in a statement. The bills are not expected to win enough votes to advance in the Senate, even if they pass the House. And if they did pass the Senate, they would lack enough support to override a veto. Backers of the Iran deal said Republicans were trying to appeal to voters just days before the convention where Trump is due to become the party‚Äôs presidential nominee. Polls show an overwhelming majority of Americans have an unfavorable view of Iran. Dylan Williams, vice president for government affairs at J Street, a pro-Israel group that supported the nuclear deal, said such legislation plays into voters‚Äô frustration with what they see as a do-nothing Congress. ‚ÄúThis kind of grandstanding not only endangers our security by endangering the deal, it‚Äôs exactly the type of politics that people are sick of,‚Äù he said.

"Trump and Christie join forces to attack Obama, Clinton","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans Donald Trump and Chris Christie teamed up on Monday to assail Democratic President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as weak on domestic security, making the kind of one-two punch possible if Trump picks Christie as his running mate. At a rally in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and Christie, the tough-talking New Jersey governor, seized on the Dallas police shootings as examples of why Americans need a ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù candidate like Trump. Much of the debate about security in the presidential campaign has been about threats abroad. The shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers last week and violence in other cities have shifted the debate back home for now. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, presented himself as ‚Äúthe law and order candidate‚Äù and called Clinton weak. He said she has grown out of touch with the plight of ordinary Americans and cited her making paid speeches to corporate interests as a cause. ‚ÄúPerhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives, instead of spending time with real people in real pain,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe disconnect in America is deep. There are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else,‚Äù said Trump. In the final days of his search for a vice presidential running mate, Trump was introduced at the event by Christie, who is one of Trump‚Äôs top potential picks to be his vice presidential running mate. Christie, a former rival of Trump for the presidential nomination, showed himself capable of assuming the role of political attack dog, a job the vice presidential nominee usually assumes. He suggested Obama has taken sides against police in the country‚Äôs debate over race and police brutality. ‚ÄúWe need a president who once again will put law and order at the top of the priority of the presidency of this country,‚Äù Christie said. ‚ÄúOur police officers ... need to understand that the president of the United States and his administration will give them the benefit of the doubt, not always believe that what they have done is somehow wrong.‚Äù Trump has been test-driving his vice presidential possibilities. He campaigned last week with former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, and is to appear with a third No. 2 possibility, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, in Indiana on Tuesday. The New York businessman has appeared most comfortable publicly with Gingrich. Both Gingrich and Christie have been advisers for Trump behind the scenes. Trump is also considering retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn for the job, but told The Washington Post in an interview published on Monday that he is leaning toward a conventional politician. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need two anti-establishment people,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúSomeone respected by the establishment and liked by the establishment would be good for unification. I do like unification of the Republican Party.‚Äù Trump said he would decide on his vice presidential pick in the next three or four days. The Republican National Convention, at which he is to be nominated as the party‚Äôs candidate, opens in Cleveland next Monday.

"Sanders could endorse Clinton's White House bid, but some divisions linger","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is set to throw his support behind fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs bid for the White House on Tuesday, a boost for the former secretary of state as she prepares to face off with Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election. An endorsement from Sanders would end a bitterly fought battle for the Democratic nomination that split the party over education, healthcare and climate change, and comes after Clinton offered Sanders a handful of policy concessions on those issues in recent weeks. At a rally in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the pair will appear together to discuss a shared ‚Äúcommitment to building an America that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,‚Äù according to statements released Monday by both campaigns.  Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver would not confirm whether Sanders would formally endorse Clinton on Tuesday but said the rally will be the first of many in which Sanders will ‚Äúbe out there stumping for the Democratic nominee.‚Äù Sanders had been under pressure for weeks from Democratic Party officials to throw his weight behind Clinton after she locked up the required number of delegates last month with a string of wins in state-by-state primary contests, but had resisted, citing policy differences. Clinton needs Sanders‚Äô supporters to boost her chances against Trump in her run for the White House. Only about 40 percent of Sanders‚Äô supporters say they would vote for her, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling.  Weaver said that despite Sanders backing of Clinton, he would likely still press on with his efforts to reform the Democratic Party nominating process after a contentious primary season, pushing to open primaries to independent voters and change the roles of superdelegates, party stalwarts who can support a nominee of their choosing regardless of how people voted in their districts. In the past few weeks, both camps have been in regular contact on how to bring Clinton closer to some of Sanders‚Äô progressive stances on issues like wealth inequality, trade, healthcare, education, and the environment in an effort to unify the party. But some Sanders‚Äô supporters are not fully satisfied by Clinton‚Äôs concessions on the party platform - most of which centered on education and healthcare - suggesting there may be some room for friction at the Democratic National Convention later this month where Clinton is set to be formally nominated. ‚ÄúThis is a platform clearly influenced by Bernie Sanders,‚Äù said James Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute and a Sanders appointee to the party‚Äôs platform drafting committee.      But, he added, ‚Äúthere were several areas where the Clinton campaign lost an opportunity to not only reach out to the Sanders base but to also to make a dramatic statement to the American people in general that would have gone a long way in helping her demonstrate that she will be a different kind of candidate,‚Äù he said.  For example, he said, the party could have used stronger language in its policy platform draft to condemn the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Sanders has argued would hurt American workers and which Clinton has also vocally opposed. Sanders‚Äô challenge to Clinton, one of the best-known figures in U.S. politics, lasted far longer than expected, running for four months and across 50 states and yielding record numbers of small donations to his campaign.  He has previously vowed to help Clinton defeat Trump but has been reluctant to end his campaign, and has come short of making a formal endorsement even as other prominent Democrats have rallied around her, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the party‚Äôs liberal wing. On Monday, the Communications Workers of America endorsed Clinton, after having earlier endorsed Sanders.  ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 "
Race for U.S. Senate seat in Indiana shaken up by Hill withdrawal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Baron Hill on Monday announced he was leaving the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in Indiana, clearing the way for a potentially more popular, better-funded Democratic candidate and possibly helping the party‚Äôs prospects in November‚Äôs elections. ‚ÄúAfter consulting with my family, my staff and party leaders, I am withdrawing from the U.S. Senate race and removing my name from the November ballot,‚Äù Hill, a former Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives said in a Facebook post.

Bayh was not immediately available for comment, but if he enters the race, he would challenge Representative Todd Young, the Republican nominee. In announcing his decision, Hill noted that Democrats have a good chance of winning majority control of the Senate, ‚Äúespecially with a strong nominee who has the money, name identification and resources to win. I do not want to stand in the way of Democrats winning Indiana and the U.S. Senate.‚Äù Bayh, who served two terms in the Senate before retiring in 2010, has nearly $10 million in cash on hand, according to the latest Federal Election Commission filings.

Obama must make new budget request for Iraq troops: Thornberry,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee said on Monday that President Barack Obama must ask Congress for additional funds to pay the deployment of more troops to Iraq, as Congress and the White House debate defense spending amid mandatory budget cuts. ‚ÄúAdded to the President‚Äôs Afghanistan announcement last week, the United States will now be deploying thousands more troops than we have budgeted for in the President‚Äôs budget request,‚Äù Representative Mac Thornberry said in a statement. ‚ÄúThose deployments can only be fully supported through a supplemental budget request,‚Äù Thornberry said.

Clinton's conundrum: caught between protesters and police,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The shocking shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers have magnified the challenge that Hillary Clinton faces as she tries to reassure both voters jittery about social unrest and activists angry about law-enforcement abuses that she is on their side. For Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, the political concerns going forward are two-fold. She can‚Äôt afford to alienate black and progressive voters she needs to show up in large numbers in the November election by taking too strong a stand against the protests like those recently in Louisiana and Minnesota that resulted in hundreds of arrests.  At the same time, Clinton can‚Äôt allow more moderate voters worried about the violent images on their TV screens to gravitate to her Republican rival, Donald Trump, who has attempted to use the tragedy in Dallas to argue that he is the better law-and-order candidate.  Clinton herself recognizes the fine line she is trying to navigate. In remarks Friday following the Dallas sniper attack that left five officers dead, she acknowledged she was sending a mixed message in advocating for reform to curb police misconduct while at the same time praising the honor and bravery of police officers. ‚ÄúI know that, just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people,‚Äù Clinton said in Philadelphia. Polling by Reuters/Ipsos has revealed sharp differences in how Trump and Clinton‚Äôs supporters view the police when it comes to African-American suspects. Just 24 percent of Trump voters believe that black people are treated worse than whites compared to 55 percent of Clinton voters, according to a poll conducted between May 13 and June 7.  African-Americans were also almost twice as likely as whites to describe the police as ‚Äútoo violent,‚Äù according to Reuters polling. The slain Dallas gunman, Micah Johnson, shot a dozen Dallas officers because he wanted to ‚Äúkill white people,‚Äù authorities said. Prior to the attack, Clinton had tried to demonstrate her solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement after black men were killed by police in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ‚ÄúWhite people‚Äù need to start listening, she said, ‚Äúto the legitimate cries that are coming from our African-American fellow citizens.‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs words were seized upon on Sunday by retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a top contender to be Trump‚Äôs vice-presidential pick. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, called Clinton‚Äôs comments ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù in an interview with ABC News because she ‚Äútalked about white people being to blame.‚Äù Trump argued on Twitter Sunday that the United States is a ‚Äúdivided nation‚Äù due in part to the leadership of Clinton and President Barack Obama. Reports had him now strongly considering Flynn as a running mate in part because of Americans‚Äô growing concerns over public safety.  But Clinton has also had problems with black activists. Two Black Lives Matter advocates crashed a fundraiser in February, complaining about Clinton‚Äôs past comments about youth gangs. And in April, protesters sparred with her husband Bill Clinton, the former president, over the 1994 bill he signed into law that put non-violent offenders in prison for longer terms. Clinton has spoken at length about criminal-justice reform and scaling back gun rights, but still is viewed by many progressives, who have increasing sway in the party, as too centrist. Democrats, for example, are expected to formally call for the abolition of the death penalty for the first time at the party‚Äôs nominating convention later this month.  While Clinton has been critical about racial bias in the application of capital punishment, she has come short of saying it should be done away with. Trump has argued the death penalty should be automatic for anyone found guilty of murdering a police officer. Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida, said he believes Clinton can find a message that can appease both moderates and liberals on the issue of police violence.  ‚ÄúShe can talk to the types of voters who strongly support their local law enforcement, but who also understand there are very troubling stories coming out of certain communities and real issues that need to be addressed,‚Äù he said.  Clinton may be able to utilize Vice President Joe Biden, well-liked by law enforcement, as a surrogate to reach out to police groups. Clinton and Biden were scheduled to campaign together Friday, but the event was canceled in the wake of the Dallas incident.  However, Biden, as a U.S. senator, was an advocate of the 1994 crime bill that‚Äôs now the object of scorn among black activists, underscoring the thorny politics of the issue within the party.  Trump continues to enjoy the same kind of advantage among white voters that Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, held. The most recent Reuters tracking poll shows Trump leading Clinton among white likely voters by two points, while Trump trails Clinton among all likely voters by 13 points.  That makes African-American turnout particularly critical for Clinton. In 2012, Romney won almost 60 percent of the white vote but still lost handily to Obama, who drove minorities to the polls in high numbers.  ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 "

Possible Trump VP pick says he supports abortion rights,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, under consideration by Republican Donald Trump as a possible vice presidential choice, said on Sunday he favors a woman‚Äôs right to choose whether to have an abortion. That stance places Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, at odds with the official Republican Party position, which is firmly anti-abortion. Asked about his position on abortion on ABC News‚Äô ‚ÄúThis Week,‚Äù Flynn, a registered Democrat, said ‚Äúwomen have to be able to choose‚Äù and that women ‚Äúhave to make the decision because they‚Äôre the ... ones that are going to decide to bring up that child or not.‚Äù  Trump, the presumptive Republican White House nominee, has said he will pick his vice president before the party‚Äôs nomination convention opens on July 18. Flynn has been an adviser to the Trump campaign since early this year.  The Washington Post reported on Saturday that Trump is becoming increasingly infatuated with Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012-2014 under President Barack Obama, because he believes national unrest and the threat of terrorism may demand a ‚Äútough and steady‚Äù presence on the ticket.  As a businessman and real-estate developer, Trump also likes the idea of teaming up with another non-politician, the Post reported. For weeks Trump has conducted a high-profile canvassing of Republican political stalwarts as part of his running mate search, but he has also made clear he is looking at what a military leader would bring to the ticket. A source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters on Saturday that Flynn had emerged as a possibility. According to the source, Flynn is seen as someone who would be able to help Trump in the area of national security at a time of challenges abroad like the threat from Islamic State militants. Trump is also considering more conventional vice presidential contenders, such as former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, Indiana Governor Mike Pence or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Obama says attacks on police hurt Black Lives Matter cause,"MADRID (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama has warned that attacks on police over racial bias would hurt the anti-racism Black Lives Matter movement, days after a sniper killed five police officers in Dallas in apparent revenge for police shootings of black people.  Obama said although most activists from the Black Lives Matter movement wanted to see better relations between communities and law enforcement, violence and overly broad criticism against police undermined the protest movement. ‚ÄúI want to say to say to everyone concerned about ... racial bias in the criminal justice system that maintaining a truthful, serious and respectful tone is going to help mobilize American society to bring about real change,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWhenever those of us who are concerned about failures of the criminal justice system attack police, you are doing a disservice to the cause,‚Äù he told a news conference in Madrid where he is on a one-day visit.  Micah Johnson, a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war, opened fire on police officers on Thursday during a protest in Dallas against the fatal shootings of two black men by police in Louisiana and Minnesota the previous day. Johnson wanted to ‚Äúkill white people, especially white officers,‚Äù Dallas Police Chief David Brown said after the attack on Thursday night. The Black Lives Matter group said on Friday it advocated dignity, not murder, in response to the shooting that also left seven other police officers and two civilians wounded. Obama said there was legitimate criticism to be made of the criminal justice system and that citizens should continue to protest against it. ‚ÄúI would hope that police organizations are also respectful of the frustrations that people in these communities feel and not just dismiss these protests as political correctness or politics or attacks on police,‚Äù he said.

Sanders' TPP stance shot down by Democrats' platform committee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trade deal fight led by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday failed to fully materialize as rival and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton announced a compromise to expand mandatory healthcare funding over the next decade. At a meeting of the Democratic Party draft platform committee in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday, supporters of Sanders were unable to influence the committee to adopt strong language opposing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, marking a powerful blow to the efforts by the U.S. senator from Vermont to push the party further to the left. ‚ÄúWe did everything we could to win that vote,‚Äù said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels. ‚ÄúIt was very disappointing.‚Äù Instead of a condemnation specific to the TPP, the committee reached language saying they would oppose ‚Äútrade agreements that do not support good American jobs.‚Äù Sanders has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it, which he says are unfair to American workers. Clinton has also come out as opposed to the agreement.  Despite Clinton having already secured the requisite delegates to clinch the party‚Äôs nomination at the July 25-28 convention, Sanders remains in the race to be the party‚Äôs nominee.  He has indicated that he would hold off on endorsing Clinton for the Nov. 8 general election fight against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump until she adopted policies and campaign language that more closely resembled his own more liberal tone. ‚ÄúI would like to say that while this vote was disappointing, we have won some tremendous victories,‚Äù Gunnels said, including securing language in the draft supporting a federal $15 minimum wage, another trademark issue for Sanders. On the same day, the Clinton campaign announced changes to its healthcare policy proposal, including increasing mandatory healthcare funding under the Affordable Care Act by $40 billion over the next 10 years, highlighting the significant influence Sanders still yields over the party.  ‚ÄúWe have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable healthcare to everyone in America,‚Äù Clinton said in a statement that included her intention to give Americans the choice of a public-option insurance plan and allow for individuals below Medicare age, beginning at 55, to opt in to the U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans‚Äô hospital bills. Sanders has made combating healthcare costs a rallying cry of his campaign and often battled with Clinton during the primary race on how best to reach their shared goal of universal healthcare. On Saturday, Sanders praised the updates to Clinton‚Äôs proposal as a step in the right direction to ‚Äúsave lives and ease suffering,‚Äù indicating, along with the more liberal tone in several parts of the 2016 platform draft, a growing compromise between the two camps. For Clinton, an endorsement from Sanders - seen as a champion of the progressive left - could open the door to many of his supporters who have been reluctant to support the more moderate Clinton. ‚ÄúThe proposal brought forth today by Secretary Clinton, working with our campaign, is an important step forward in expanding healthcare in America - and expanding health insurance and healthcare access to tens of millions of Americans,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúI congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative.‚Äù The New York Times reported on Thursday that an endorsement is imminent, and Sanders is expected to officially throw his support behind Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire early next week.

"U.S. gun rules heighten tension between police, citizens: Obama","WARSAW (Reuters) - President Barack Obama pledged on Saturday to seek ways to calm racial tensions and reduce divisions between police and minorities during his final months in office, but he warned that easy access to guns nationwide exacerbated the problem. Obama spoke at the end of a week in which five policemen were killed by a sniper in Dallas and two black men were killed by police in Minnesota and Louisiana. He said he would bring together civil rights and law enforcement leaders for talks at the White House next week after returning from a trip to Europe. Obama, the first black U.S. president, has spoken out on racial issues throughout his time in the White House. He has also tried but failed to reform American gun laws, stymied by Republicans in Congress who have opposed any measures that they seen as impinging on the Constitutional right to bear arms, despite a series of mass shootings in recent years. Obama said the Dallas police force reduced murder rates and community complaints by taking the issue of race and police conduct seriously, and said he hoped that would inspire ‚Äúconstructive actions‚Äù in the coming weeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit that we all need to embrace. That‚Äôs the spirit that I want to build on,‚Äù he said during a press conference in Poland. But the divisive issue of gun control could not be separated from the tension between police and local citizens, he said.   Obama noted that Dallas police on Thursday had to protect themselves and citizens from sniper fire while deciphering who had guns among those taking part in a protest decrying police shootings of black men. The presence of a gun in the car where Philando Castile, 32, was killed by police in Minnesota on Wednesday contributed to that event, he said. ‚ÄúIn Minneapolis, we don‚Äôt know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed, but it caused, in some fashion, those tragic events,‚Äù Obama told reporters.  ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just ignore that and pretend that that‚Äôs somehow political ... it is a contributing factor ‚Äì not the sole factor ‚Äì but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve.‚Äù Obama is very unlikely to succeed in reviving major gun control reform before he leaves office in January. Lawmakers in Congress have fought over three rival gun measures since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Democrats promised to put pressure on Republicans next week to win votes for measures to expand background checks and allow the Justice Department to block gun sales to people on government watch lists. Obama said on Saturday he hoped his legacy on the issue of race would be one of urging Americans to listen to each other and understand the country‚Äôs difficult relationship with race. ‚ÄúThe legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didn‚Äôt suddenly vanish with the passage of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act or the election of Barack Obama,‚Äù he said.

Obama 'concerned' about U.S. State Department handling of classified information,"WARSAW (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Saturday he was concerned about how the State Department handles classified information but cast this as part of a government-wide challenge in the age of email, texts and smartphones. FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday recommended against prosecuting Hillary Clinton or her aides for their ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of classified information on the private email server that she used as secretary of state.

Republican Party chairman confident in Cleveland convention security,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Party chief Reince Priebus expressed confidence on Saturday that security will be able to handle any protests at the party‚Äôs convention later this month in Cleveland, where Donald Trump is to be nominated as the Republican presidential candidate. Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Reuters in a telephone interview that the tragic shootings in Texas, Minnesota and Louisiana in recent days may lead to a more peaceful discourse in general across the country. Cleveland police on Friday tightened their security plan for the July 18-21 Republican National Convention in the wake of the shootings. They also increased surveillance and intelligence operations. The outpouring of grief among Americans after the bloodshed could lead to a ‚Äúmore understanding and polite discourse and a feeling of support in communities and with police,‚Äù Priebus said, and that this same feeling of understanding could also take place in Cleveland. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working really hard on security. I‚Äôm very confident that things are going to go very well in Cleveland. The police are there in full force to be helpful to protesters, but also to keep the event safe and free from incident,‚Äù he said. Priebus, who has worked to rally Republicans behind Trump, said the convention should serve as a vehicle to unify more party loyalists behind the New York businessman whose incendiary rhetoric and policy positions have troubled some Republicans. Priebus added that the ‚Äúnever Trump‚Äù movement has ebbed and that he did not believe any rebellion among Republican delegates at the convention against Trump would succeed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to be unhappy because your person didn‚Äôt win. I get that part. But it‚Äôs another step to now say because I don‚Äôt like the way this is going, I‚Äôm going to take something away from someone who won it fair and square. There‚Äôs just not a lot of people that are willing to do that,‚Äù he said. Priebus, who has privately counseled Trump, said it is important for him to continue making the case against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton after the FBI concluded she had been ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in handling some sensitive emails as President Barack Obama‚Äôs secretary of state. Trump, at a campaign rally in Ohio on Wednesday, had sharply criticized Clinton at the outset, but then diverted to attacking the news media for how it is covering his campaign. ‚ÄúIn a 45-minute rally, he spent a long time on Hillary and I think it‚Äôs OK for him to divert here and there, but I do think focusing on Hillary is important and a vision for America is important,‚Äù Priebus said.

Pentagon says near deal with Lockheed for more F-35 fighter jets,"RAF FAIRFORD, England (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin Corp are in the final stages of negotiations about two contracts for 160 fighter jets, tandem deals valued at more than $14 billion, the Pentagon‚Äôs F-35 program manager said on Saturday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the end game,‚Äù Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan said in an interview at the Royal International Air Tattoo the world‚Äôs largest military airshow, where six F-35 Lightning II jets are flying this week. Bogdan said an agreement could be finalised soon, but declined to predict if it could be announced at the Farnborough International Airshow next week. He said all the major issues had been resolved and the fate of the deal was largely in Lockheed‚Äôs hands at the moment. Lockheed‚Äôs F-35 program manager Jeff Babione had told reporters on Thursday that he expected to reach an agreement soon about contracts for the ninth and 10th production contracts for the new warplane. Sources familiar with the two contracts said they would likely be valued between $14 billion and $15 billion. Babione said the price of the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing version of the jet would drop to under $100 million per plane in the 10th low-rate production batch, including an engine built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. Bogdan said he was continuing to work on a block buy deal for international partners on the $379 billion warplane project, the largest arms program in the world, as part of a larger effort to drive down the jets‚Äô cost.  Buying larger numbers of jets at a time ‚Äî starting with the 12th production batch of jets ‚Äî could generate savings of $2 billion to $2.8 billion, even if the U.S. military was not able to join in until it got congressional approval, he said.  The U.S. military services would likely join in starting with the 13th and 14th production lots, which would reduce the initially anticipated savings by ‚Äúhundreds of millions of dollars,‚Äù he said. Bogdan told reporters the program office was carefully assessing any potential impact on trade and tariffs stemming from Britain‚Äôs vote to leave the European Union, but the initial expectation was that it would not have much impact. A drop in the value of the British pound could help lower some costs, since 15 percent of the jet is built by UK firms.            ",politicsNews,"July 9, 2016 "
Gun in Minnesota car may have contributed to events there: Obama,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Saturday that the prevalence of guns in U.S. society is one factor behind American violence and the fact that there was a gun in the car contributed to the shooting of a black Minnesota man last week. ‚ÄúIn Minneapolis, we don‚Äôt know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed but it caused, in some fashion, those tragic events,‚Äù Obama told reporters. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just ignore that and pretend that that‚Äôs somehow political ... it is a contributing factor ‚Äìnot the sole factor ‚Äì but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 9, 2016 "
Clinton says she relied on State staff for classification decisions,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton disputed a scathing assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that she was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù with classified government secrets, saying on Friday she relied on the judgment of her subordinates at the U.S. State Department. After maintaining for more than a year that she did not send or receive classified information through her unauthorized private email system, she acknowledged in a string of interviews on Friday she may have at least unwittingly done so, three days after the FBI concluded this happened at least 110 times. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said she ‚Äúcertainly did not believe‚Äù that she was handling classified information on her email system at the time, but emphasized that she followed the lead of her subordinates on whether information was classified. ‚ÄúI did not have a basis for second-guessing their conclusion,‚Äù Clinton said in an interview with CNN, saying she had the ‚Äúhighest regard‚Äù for her former colleagues. ‚ÄúThese are experienced diplomats, they have expertise in handling classified material,‚Äù she said in a separate interview with PBS Newshour. ‚ÄúThey were not careless and the material that they sent, they did not believe that was classified.‚Äù Clinton, who was the department‚Äôs most senior classifying authority during her four-year tenure at its helm, did not address the FBI‚Äôs conclusion that she herself sent information on topics classified as ‚Äòtop secret‚Äô, the highest level, through a private server she kept in her basement.  ‚ÄúI have said, and I repeated, that it was a mistake to use personal email and I regret that,‚Äù she said in another interview with ABC. It is a crime to mishandle classified information, and while FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday there was evidence Clinton or her aides may have broken these laws, there was not enough evidence of criminal intent for a prosecution. In an unusual 15-minute announcement explaining the FBI‚Äôs findings, Comey ended up dismaying both Republicans and Democrats. While Clinton‚Äôs Republican opponents have fumed at the decision not to file criminal charges, Clinton and her staff have disputed some of Comey‚Äôs criticisms that undermine her argument that she has better judgment than Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. Comey called her and her staff ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù and said that any ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù government employee should have recognized that such information should not be aired in emails. Her server was so poorly secured the FBI could not eliminate the possibility it had not been hacked by the country‚Äôs enemies, Comey said. Asked if she agreed that she was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù, Clinton told CNN she was not, adding that Comey had ‚Äúclarified‚Äù his remarks. It was unclear what clarification Clinton meant. In lengthier comments before lawmakers on Thursday, Comey again spoke of Clinton‚Äôs and her staff‚Äôs carelessness and ‚Äúreal sloppiness‚Äù, adding that it seemed she was not ‚Äúparticularly sophisticated with respect to classified information.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 "
"Faced with Trump and Clinton, Americans yearn for third choice: Reuters/Ipsos poll","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans‚Äô demand for an alternative to the two main presidential candidates has surged since the last election, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll shows, underscoring the unpopularity of Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Based on 2,153 interviews, Friday‚Äôs poll results suggest a strong potential for a third-party candidate - like Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party or Jill Stein of the Green Party - to take enough of the vote in the Nov. 8 presidential election to influence its outcome. According to the July 1-8 poll, 21 percent of likely voters will not back Trump or Clinton. That compares with about 13 percent of likely voters who opted out of the two main choices at the same point in the 2012 race between incumbent President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The poll also showed a majority of American voters have an overall ‚Äúunfavorable‚Äù view of both main candidates, with 46 percent of Clinton supporters and 47 percent of Trump supporters saying their top priority when voting will be to stop the opposing candidate from reaching the White House. Demand for an alternative could be decisive in hotly contested battleground states. In Florida in 2012, for instance, Obama won by less than 1 percentage point. If this year‚Äôs race is just as tight, third-party candidates could draw enough support to flip the state from one major party to the other. Despite this, both Johnson and Stein have a problem that  make their influence hard to predict - most voters still do not know who they are. Of likely voters, 23 percent say they are at least ‚Äúsomewhat familiar‚Äù with Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico. That drops to 16 percent for Stein, a physician. Johnson could appeal to both liberals and conservatives. He wants to legalize marijuana and replace income and payroll taxes with a consumption tax.  Stein could make a strong bid to backers of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race with Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Stein wants to abolish student debt and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. She also aims for the country to run on renewable energy by 2030.  Stein‚Äôs communications coordinator, David Doonan, said that the campaign is working to boost her numbers and that the Green Party is circulating a letter that directly appeals to people who supported Sanders. ‚ÄúHe also started very low‚Äù in the polls, Doonan said.  So far it appears that Johnson and Stein draw support evenly from Clinton and Trump when they are included in opinion polls. In a four-way race,¬†45 percent of likely voters support Clinton, 34 percent Trump, 5 percent Johnson and 4 percent Stein, according to a separate five-day polling average on July 8.  That compares with¬†46 percent for Clinton and 33 percent for Trump in a two-way race.  Given a little more information about the two alternative candidates, respondents who back Johnson and Stein draw more deeply from Clinton‚Äôs support. Some¬†44 percent of likely voters support Clinton, 34 percent  Trump, 7 percent Johnson and 5 percent Stein, after reading the following statement, according to the poll: ‚ÄúJill Stein, the Green Party candidate for President, has taken an environmental position supporting a strong government role limiting carbon-based fuels, such as coal. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for President, has supported severely limiting the government‚Äôs role, including slashing taxes and reducing programs such as Medicare and the military and broadly decriminalizing currently illegal drugs.‚Äù The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English with American adults in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The survey of voters who want an alternative to Trump and Clinton included 2,153 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points. The five-day average poll that ended July 8 included about 1,240 likely voters and has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. Presidential Election 2016     cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=us-2016 GRAPHIC: Race to the White House    tmsnrt.rs/1Tr5O3e Tales from the Trail blog    here Reuters election newsletter    here Poll: Your vote for president (Clinton-Trump-Johnson-Stein)    polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_26/filters/LIKELY:1 Poll: Your vote for president (Clinton-Trump)    polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/LIKELY:1/type/smallest/dates/20160601-20160708/collapsed/true/spotlight/1 Poll: Your vote for president (Clinton-Trump-Johnson-Stein-No.2)    polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM952Y16/filters/LIKELY:1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 "
"Violence again convulses 2016 election campaign, testing Trump, Clinton","(Reuters) - In the hours after a gunman shot 12 police officers, killing five in Dallas, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton abruptly canceled campaign events. Their Twitter accounts largely went quiet. The shootings marked yet another convulsive event in the 2016 political season, one in which Clinton and Trump have scrambled to find the right response to terror attacks abroad, mass shootings at home, and protests over police killings of African Americans. Much of the violence, captured live on smartphones and endlessly replayed on cable television news, has fueled Americans‚Äô fears about their personal safety, polls show. It has  evoked memories of 1968, when civil rights leader Martin Luther King and Democratic presidential candidate Robert Kennedy were assassinated in a turbulent era of protests against the Vietnam war and racial segregation. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing wild acts of gun violence and we are polarized in our politics and in the public square,‚Äù said historian Douglas Brinkley. ‚ÄúEvery 48 hours there seems to be some horrific event that jars and jerks our consciousness into a new dimension.‚Äù Historically, uncertain times tend to push the party out of power. Witness Republican Ronald Reagan‚Äôs defeat of incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980 during the Iran hostage crisis, or Obama‚Äôs victory over Republican John McCain in 2008 as the U.S. economy collapsed. But that may not be the case for Trump, who has yet to convince a majority of Americans that his would be a steady hand at the tiller. Trump‚Äôs initial reaction to Dallas suggested he understands the stakes. He issued a sober statement of unity that was unlike many of his public utterances that are often derided by critics as hyperbolic or inflammatory. ‚ÄúOur nation has become too divided. Too many Americans feel like they‚Äôve lost hope. Crime is harming too many citizens. Racial tensions have gotten worse, not better. This isn‚Äôt the American Dream we all want for our children,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is a time, perhaps more than ever, for strong leadership, love and compassion. We will pull through these tragedies.‚Äù   With race relations becoming a more prominent issue in the White House race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a top contender to be Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate, told Fox News that Trump and his No. 2 can help broaden their appeal by going to inner cities, where many African Americans live.In responding to the spasm of gun violence, Clinton has called for more regulations on the gun industry and has aligned herself with the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence against African-Americans. In a round of TV appearances, Clinton said she had been working her whole life to try to bridge the racial divide. Her comments follow the police shooting of two black men in two separate incidents in Louisiana and Minnesota over the past week. The Dallas gunman told police he was angry about the killings. ‚ÄúI will call for white people, like myself, to put ourselves in the shoes of those African American families ... who fear every time their children go somewhere. I‚Äôm going to be talking about white people,‚Äù Clinton said on CNN. Democratic strategist Bud Jackson said she is hitting the right tone. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is an issue that she needs to take advantage of,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn fact it would probably hurt her if she is perceived as taking advantage of it.‚Äù  But the demand for change is sweeping among voters. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken over the last five weeks, nearly two-thirds of Americans feel the country is on the wrong track, reflecting their general unease with the economy, terror threats and violence. ‚ÄúHer challenge is to show she can cope with these issues and that she would bring change and would not be the same,‚Äù said presidential historian Thomas Alan Schwartz. Trump has said a Clinton win in the Nov. 8 election would amount to a third term for President Barack Obama. Clinton has embraced many of the policies of her former rival in the 2008 presidential election and campaigned with him this week. Lanhee Chen, who advised 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney and 2016 presidential candidate Marco Rubio, said a more civil discourse in American politics would help to calm people‚Äôs general fears.  ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs bigger issue around civility and rhetoric and discourse and how our leaders appeal or don‚Äôt appeal to our better angels. That‚Äôs really what this is about. I see this as an absence of leadership all around.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 "
"U.S. Women's Open must leave Trump National, says Burk","(Reuters) - Fourteen years after criticizing Augusta National Golf Club for its all-male membership policy, women‚Äôs issues expert Martha Burk has called for next year‚Äôs U.S. Women‚Äôs Open to be moved from Trump National in New Jersey. In a blog for The Huffington Post on Friday, Burk lambasted tournament organizers, the United States Golf Association, for placing ‚Äúprofit over principle‚Äù and added a link to a petition to force the USGA to hold the event elsewhere. ‚ÄúSeems the USGA, no stranger to hypocrisy, refuses to move next year‚Äôs U.S. Women‚Äôs Open from the Trump-owned Bedminster club, even though the USGA issued a public statement condemning Trump‚Äôs racist views after his ‚ÄòMexican rapist‚Äô rant when he announced his candidacy,‚Äù Burk wrote. Republican presidential candidate Trump has angered many people with his polarizing words on the campaign trail, including his promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. His antagonistic comments have already cost him in the golfing world. The elite PGA Grand Slam of Golf, a 36-hole stroke-play event that features the winners of the season‚Äôs four majors, was scrapped last year due to complications over the proposed venue, Trump‚Äôs National course in Los Angeles. Last month, the PGA Tour announced that its long-established tournament in Miami would move from Trump‚Äôs Doral course to Mexico City next year, a switch prompted by sponsorship issues. With the 2016 U.S. Women‚Äôs Open being played this week at CordeValle in San Martin, California, Burk has turned her attention to next year‚Äôs edition, even though ‚Äúthe protest is not over exclusionary policies at Bedminster, if there are any‚Äù. She wrote: ‚ÄúThe objection is to one of the ruling bodies of golf kowtowing to Trump‚Äôs overtly racist and sexist views. That shows where the USGA really stands, despite the lip-service-only condemnation a year ago.‚Äù The USGA, PGA Tour, LPGA and PGA of America had distanced themselves from Trump‚Äôs explosive comments in a joint statement issued last August. Burk referenced the Augusta National controversy, saying ‚Äúthe USGA ignored its prohibition against holding events at clubs that discriminate on the basis of race or gender by standing solidly behind the Trump-like dinos holding the Masters Tournament - even though it was clearly in violation of their own by-laws.‚Äù Augusta National‚Äôs membership policy had been an issue for years, most notably in 2002 when Burk led a series of protests that prompted a heated war of words with Augusta‚Äôs then-chairman Hootie Johnson. ‚ÄúThere may well come a day when women will be invited to join our membership, but that timetable will be ours, and not at the point of a bayonet,‚Äù Johnson declared at the time. Augusta National, home of the Masters golf tournament, finally ended an all-male policy that had endured for 80 years when it announced in August 2012 that two women would be admitted as members for the first time. Burk, a co-founder of the Center for Advancement of Public Policy, is director of the corporate accountability project for the National Council of Women‚Äôs Organizations.

Dallas attack adds to Cleveland concerns before Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Cleveland police on Friday tightened their security plan for the Republican National Convention after the deadly shootings of police officers in Dallas, increasing surveillance and intelligence operations just 10 days before the convention. Other police departments across the country required officers to patrol in pairs rather than alone following the ambush in Dallas, the deadliest day for police in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. In Cleveland, the attack raised another potential threat during the July 18-21 convention, when Donald Trump is expected to receive the Republican nomination for president.  The police officers‚Äô labor union, rank-and-file cops and some outside experts had already questioned Cleveland‚Äôs preparedness for the convention with the city‚Äôs police under federal supervision over use of force. Ten days before the event, Cleveland was still training police officers for duty at the convention, which is expected to draw 50,000 visitors as well as clamorous protests and crown the most contentious presidential candidate in memory. Rather than a security team reinforced by the country‚Äôs largest police departments as it hoped, the city has cobbled together 3,000 officers, mostly from state agencies, who will use borrowed and rented equipment. ‚ÄúWhen the convention was awarded to Cleveland (in 2014), folks weren‚Äôt thinking about this.... Yes, there is a generalized worry,‚Äù said Matthew Barge, court-appointed monitor for the U.S. Justice Department‚Äôs oversight of Cleveland police. Ed Tomba, the city‚Äôs deputy police chief and head of convention security, had previously told Reuters he was ‚Äúvery, very confident‚Äù in the city‚Äôs convention plan. He reiterated that confidence in a telephone interview on Friday in response to the Dallas attack. ‚ÄúWe have got to make some changes without a doubt,‚Äù Tomba said, mentioning the surveillance of potential threats from street level and farther away.   ‚ÄúWe will have plenty of people watching over different locations. We are beefing up the intelligence component, too. They are going to be very, very active,‚Äù Tomba said. Police throughout the United States ordered their officers to work in pairs following the shooting in Dallas, including those in New York, Chicago and St. Louis. New York officers will ‚Äúdouble up‚Äù on all assignments and auxiliary police officers who are unarmed except for night sticks will not be used in the field for the next few days, Police Commissioner William Bratton told a news conference. St. Louis police also will be required to wear ballistic vests when leaving any station for enforcement activities, Chief Sam Dotson said on Twitter. Tomba said he spent part of Friday morning reassuring out-of-town police departments that their officers on loan to Cleveland will be safe during the convention, telling them in an email that ‚Äúwe cannot pull the plan off without them.‚Äù Cleveland police union President Steve Loomis has been among the most vocal critics, complaining that front-line officers would be undertrained and poorly equipped.  ‚ÄúThey are setting up my guys for failure,‚Äù Loomis said before the Dallas attack. Civic leaders have said Cleveland is experiencing a renaissance following decades of decline, and that reputation will be on the line during the convention. Two separate incidents of fatal police shootings in recent years have brought unwelcome national attention to the city. In 2012, 13 Cleveland officers fired 137 shots into the car of an unarmed African-American man and his female passenger, killing both. The U.S. Justice Department investigated and imposed special federal oversight known as a consent decree that remains in force. Then in 2014, four months after the Republicans chose Cleveland for the convention, a white police officer shot dead 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was black, in a case that became a national focal point for the protest movement Black Lives Matter.  The most recent report from the federal monitor overseeing the Cleveland consent decree portrays a police department where physical infrastructure is strained, with computers and cars ‚Äúrun-down or deficient,‚Äù forcing police to pay for repairs out of their own pockets and use their personal vehicles for police  work.  Loomis, the union leader, said half of Cleveland police officers have yet to receive convention training. That number is ‚Äúprobably close,‚Äù Tomba said on Thursday. Upon getting the convention, Cleveland asked 200 police departments to send officers, including those from big cities which generally have the best anti-terrorist schooling. Many big cities turned Cleveland down, saying they were unable to spare officers, Tomba said. But Cleveland has exceeded its goal by bringing in 3,000 reinforcements who will receive training at home plus a short course upon arriving, Tomba said. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 "
Florida congresswoman indicted in fraud scheme,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A federal grand jury indicted U.S. Representative Corrine Brown of Florida and her chief of staff on fraud charges and other crimes, accusing them of funneling money for a bogus education charity to personal use, U.S. prosecutors said on Friday. The 69-year-old Democrat from Jacksonville, Florida, denied that she had used her political position to help raise more than $800,000 that donors believed supported college scholarships and other educational purposes.  According to the 53-page indictment filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida this week, funds donated to the group One Door for Education were used to pay for a golf tournament honoring Brown, luxury box seats at a Beyonce concert, a football game and other personal expenses. Prosecutors noted that the organization was not properly registered as a non-profit group and awarded only two scholarships totaling $1,200. ‚ÄúI am innocent of the charges announced today, and intend to vigorously defend myself in court against these politically motivated allegations,‚Äù Brown said in a statement. She said she would temporarily step down from her role as the Ranking Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs due to House rules. The 24-count indictment also accuses her chief of staff, Elias ‚ÄúRonnie‚Äù Simmons, 50, of multiple counts of fraud. There was no immediate response from Brown‚Äôs office to requests for comment from Simmons.  During a court appearance on Friday, Brown and Simmons pleaded not guilty, local media reported. ‚ÄúIt is incredibly disappointing that an elected official, who took an oath year after year to serve others, would exploit the needs of children and abuse the charitable hearts of constituents to advance her own personal and political agendas and deliver them with virtually nothing,‚Äù Michelle Klimt, special agent in charge of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation division in Jacksonville, said in a statement. Brown was elected to Congress in 1992 as one of the first three black members of Florida‚Äôs congressional delegation since the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. Now seeking re-election, she faces a primary challenge in a redrawn district. Her indictment follows the June conviction of U.S. Representative Chaka Fattah of Philadelphia for orchestrating multiple frauds to enrich himself and preserve his political career. He subsequently resigned. Prosecutors said Simmons misused his position to help a relative obtain government employment and receive more than $735,000 without doing work. They said he diverted more than $80,000 of his relative‚Äôs salary for his own personal use. Brown is also accused of falsifying her tax filings. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 "
Options market signals little fear of election-tied volatility,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The November U.S. presidential election is being sold by the major parties as a defining moment for the next generation of Americans. But stock and options traders, often moved to action by political headlines, are responding with a big ‚Äòmeh.‚Äô Options bets on volatility around the Nov. 8 election are running lower than could be expected given how stocks have performed in past election cycles, BNP Paribas said. Typically, stock market volatility picks up around presidential elections. Traders use options to guard against outsized market reaction to such events. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge of near-term investor anxiety, had some big spikes this year, hitting a four-month high after the Brexit vote. But there is little to suggest that November is a big worry for stocks. Investors are focused on the quarterly earnings season starting next week. They might also be taking the view that both the Republican and Democratic prospective nominees would be more favorable for business than the current administration, analysts said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the opposite of ‚ÄòAlien vs. Predator,‚Äô‚Äù said Mark Sebastian, chief investment officer at volatility arbitrage hedge fund Karman Line Capital in Chicago, referring to the 2004 American science fiction film which had the tagline ‚Äòwhoever wins, we lose.‚Äô ‚ÄúHere, no matter who wins, Wall Street does better,‚Äù he said. Despite being called anti-business by some on Wall Street, the Obama administration has been in power over one of the best presidential cycles for stocks on record. Per BNP Paribas data, S&P 500 Index options forward implied volatility, which measures volatility expectations embedded in options, shows no dislocation over the remaining election campaign period. Had there been a big bump-up in this measure for November it would have been a sign that traders were loading up on protective contracts. ‚ÄúThe market is not ascribing a large probability to a high volatility scenario over the election period,‚Äù said Stewart Warther, an equity derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas. Market-makers, or dealers which quote prices for options, are also not expressing a great deal of anxiety over stock gyrations. If stock volatility does not pick up in November, that would be a departure from the norm, according a BNP Paribas analysis of data going back to 1948. ‚ÄúThe shape of the (volatility) curve definitely is upward sloping but it‚Äôs not like there is a huge hump out in November,‚Äù said Steve Sosnick, an equity risk manager at Timber Hill, the market-making unit of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. ‚ÄúWe have seen some demand for options but I would say it‚Äôs hardly a frenzy.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 "
U.S. House panel approves Benghazi report after two-year probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives‚Äô special Benghazi committee approved its report on Friday on the attack in Libya that killed four Americans in 2012, but the Republican-led panel set no date for ending its work after a two-year-long investigation. The committee‚Äôs chairman, Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, said the panel voted to approve the 800-page report, with seven Republicans in favor and four Democrats opposed, in a closed-door meeting. Republicans had issued the report on June 28. It included no major new revelations about the assault in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. But it criticized presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the violence, saying both she and her staff showed a ‚Äúshameful‚Äù lack of response to congressional investigators looking into the attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound.  It also accused Clinton‚Äôs State Department of failing to protect the Americans killed. Last October, Clinton, already a Democratic presidential candidate, calmly deflected harsh Republican criticism of her handling of the attack during a testy 11-hour hearing before Gowdy‚Äôs committee. Democrats have derided the report as a political vendetta against the former secretary of state. Republicans said the committee‚Äôs work would not wrap up until materials related to the report are reviewed for classified information and potential perjury claims, which would be referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ‚ÄúIf you thought a vote today would be the end of this partisan chapter of our history, you would be wrong,‚Äù Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Select Committee is poised to last for months - perhaps until right before the presidential election - and that appears to be the Republican plan,‚Äù Cummings said. Republicans plan more interviews, including one next week with Stephen Hedger, the head of legislative affairs at the Department of Defense, Cummings said. Panel Republicans issued a joint statement calling the investigation ‚Äúa great privilege and honor.‚Äù They urged President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration to clear for public release all of the supporting evidence and documents referenced in the report.

U.S. Democrats' infighting over trade pact puts Clinton in middle,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has found herself in the middle of a fight within the U.S. Democratic Party over the Pacific Rim trade pact, between President Barack Obama, who backs the deal, and opponents whose help is crucial to her White House bid. A showdown over trade is expected on Friday and Saturday when Democratic officials meet in Orlando, Florida, to negotiate language for the party‚Äôs 2016 platform, which sets policy priorities intended to guide campaign messages in the Nov. 8 election. Different factions of the party are deadlocked over platform language on the sweeping Trans Pacific Partnership, which Obama hopes to push through the U.S. Congress later this year. The current draft, which will be ratified at the July 25-28 Democratic convention in Philadelphia, acknowledges¬†‚Äúa diversity of views‚Äù over the TPP. While the platform is not binding for candidates, it is a symbol of a party‚Äôs core values. Labor unions and other TPP critics have called for a clear condemnation of the pact, which they fear could lead to steep U.S. job losses in manufacturing. But some Democrats say that would risk undercutting Obama. U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a Clinton appointee to the platform committee, told the Washington Post that while he had a long history of opposing trade pacts, he did not want Democrats on the other side of the issue to think they are not important. Gutierrez also said he thought ‚Äúdisregarding the position of the president of the United States‚Äù was not right. The intra-party rift has created a quandary for Clinton, the Democrats‚Äô presumptive nominee. She has staked out opposition to the TPP during her campaign after supporting it while she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has accused her of waffling on trade. Trump has strongly condemned the deal, calling it ‚Äúhorrible.‚Äù If Clinton embraces platform language condemning the TPP, it would please unions while causing difficulties for Obama, one of her most enthusiastic supporters. Moreover, if the platform committee cannot come up with language that satisfies Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont who had also sought the nomination and still wields considerable clout, the fight might drag into the Philadelphia convention and create a messy spectacle where Democrats will formally nominate Clinton for the White House. Labor unions told the Clinton campaign of their frustrations in a closed-door meeting on June 30. One of a series of occasional sessions to update unions supporting her on campaign staffing, logistics and other issues, it concluded with a brief question-and-answer session where AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka asked about the pact. ‚ÄúThe (platform‚Äôs) language now is unacceptable,‚Äù Hasan Solomon, the legislative director of¬†the¬†International Association of Machinists¬†and¬†Aerospace Workers, told Reuters. The¬†machinists were¬†the first industrial union to endorse Clinton and remain strong backers¬†of her candidacy. Union activists aligned with Sanders were even more blunt. ‚ÄúWhen I saw the language, my reaction was: ‚ÄòWhat are they thinking?‚Äô‚Äù said¬†Rafael Navar, national political director for the Communications Workers of America, which endorsed Sanders. ‚ÄúThe only way to challenge Trump‚Äôs appeal to millions of working-class voters in critical swing states is to be 100 percent crystal clear on opposing TPP and other job-killing trade deals.‚Äù Many union activists also voiced their opposition to the deal to Paul Booth, executive assistant to the president of the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, at a private June 1 meeting hosted by the AFL-CIO. Booth is among the platform drafting committee members suggested by Clinton. To push for changes to the TPP platform language, Sanders has encouraged his millions of supporters in emails and texts to register their dissatisfaction.

Justice Department opens criminal probe into black Louisiana man's death,"BATON ROUGE, La. (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the fatal police shooting of a black man in Louisiana‚Äôs capital, the state‚Äôs governor said on Thursday, as two deadly encounters between law enforcement and black men triggered protests in the United States. The probe comes as community leaders in Baton Rouge urged authorities to conduct a full-scale criminal probe of two white police officers over the slaying of Alton Sterling, 37, on Tuesday.  ‚ÄúI want you to know that a criminal investigation is under way. It is being led by the U.S. Department of Justice,‚Äù Louisiana Governor Jon Bel Edwards told hundreds of people at Living Faith Cathedral in Baton Rouge on Thursday evening.  ‚ÄúWe are going to come out of this tragedy stronger and more united than ever,‚Äù he added. Sterling was pinned to the ground and fatally shot in the chest outside a convenience store after the officers responded to what police said was a call about a black man reported to have made threats with a gun. The Justice Department said on Wednesday it would conduct a civil rights investigation into Sterling‚Äôs death.  The city‚Äôs mayor and police chief welcomed the move, but community leaders said they worried the probe would be too limited and urged authorities to consider all possible federal and state criminal charges against officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want this to be a narrow investigation,‚Äù Edgar Cage, a spokesman for the community organization Together Baton Rouge, said at a church earlier on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe plan to use this tragic event as a tool, a stimulant to change the culture.‚Äù President Barack Obama said in a statement he had full confidence in the Justice Department‚Äôs ability to conduct a ‚Äúthoughtful, thorough and fair inquiry‚Äù into Sterling‚Äôs death. Citing an unnamed law enforcement official, CNN reported on Thursday that a homeless man placed the 911 call after seeking money from Sterling, who was selling CDs outside the store. The 300-pound (135-kg) Sterling showed the man his gun and said to leave him alone, the official told CNN. Reuters could not independently confirm that account with Baton Rouge police, who did not respond to a request for comment. Sterling, a father of five, had several criminal convictions since the mid-1990s for battery, resisting arrest, burglary and other crimes. He was a registered sex offender after spending nearly four years in prison on a charge he had sex with a 14-year-old girl when he was 20. COMMUNITY-POLICE CHASM Sterling‚Äôs death was the first of two fatal police shootings of black men in two days. Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop on Wednesday near Minneapolis. The shootings and videos showing their bloody aftermath have sparked protests, including an overnight rally in Baton Rouge that drew about 300 people who stood in a peaceful vigil near the Triple S Food Mart where Sterling was killed. Obama said that ‚Äúall Americans should be deeply troubled‚Äù by the two deaths, which he said were indicative of wider problems in the U.S. criminal justice system. At the Baton Rouge church on Thursday, Edwards said there would be a new focus on training and retraining in the police department, and stressed the need to introduce people to the police at an early age.  His words appeared to address concerns voiced by many community leaders in recent days about a chasm between the black community and the police.  Video recorded by a bystander‚Äôs cellphone showed an officer confronting Sterling and ordering him to the ground. The two officers then tackled him to the pavement, with one pulling a gun from his holster and pointing it at Sterling‚Äôs chest. One officer shot Sterling five times at close range, and the other took something from his pants pocket as he was dying, another video recorded by Abdullah Muflahi, owner of the store where Sterling was killed in the parking lot, showed. Police said Sterling was armed. Muflahi said in an interview that police took a gun out of Sterling‚Äôs pocket after shooting him. Officers Lake and Salamoni have been put on administrative leave, police said. In Lake‚Äôs three years and Salamoni‚Äôs four years on the force, both have been cleared by the police department after prior complaints against them regarding use of force, the Advocate newspaper reported, citing records. The deaths of Sterling and Castile were the latest in a string of incidents in recent years involving police treatment of black men and boys in cities including Baltimore, Chicago, New York and Cleveland.

Obama says more must be done to address U.S. police shootings,"WARSAW, Poland (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday made an impassioned plea for the nation to do more to address the combative relationship between local police forces and the black and Hispanic communities they serve, after the shootings of two black men by police in Minnesota and Louisiana in two days. ‚ÄúWhen incidents like this occur, there‚Äôs a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their skin they are not being treated the same,‚Äù Obama said shortly after landing early Friday morning in Warsaw, Poland, for a NATO summit. ‚ÄúAnd that should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue. It‚Äôs not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about,‚Äù he said. The deaths of Philando Castile at a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, and Alton Sterling outside a convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were the latest in a string of shootings that have led to calls for a revamp in the way police interact with the black community. Citing statistics that show that blacks are more likely to be killed by police officers and receive harsher sentences than their white counterparts, Obama said it is ‚Äúincumbent on all of us to say we can do better than this.‚Äù A White House task force on better policing tactics issued recommendations last year on how to improve community relations with law enforcement. Obama encouraged local police forces to adopt the practices outlined by the task force, saying that less distrust of police would help to keep officers safe and lead to less deadly shootings by authorities. Critics of the push to reform local police tactics have charged that Obama has not shown enough concern about police officers who are shot in the line of duty. Obama repeatedly stressed that he believes that most police officers do their jobs without bias and that addressing complaints about police brutality would not undermine law enforcement. ‚ÄúWhen people say black lives matter, that doesn‚Äôt mean blue lives don‚Äôt matter. It just means that all lives matter, but right now the big concern is the fact that data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of attacks,‚Äù he said. Earlier on Thursday, Obama issued a Facebook post urging the nation to address the ‚Äúappearance or reality of racial bias‚Äù in policing. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 "
U.S. GMO food labeling bill passes Senate,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved legislation that would for the first time require food to carry labels listing genetically-modified ingredients, which labeling supporters say could create loopholes for some U.S. crops. The Senate voted 63-30 for the bill that would display GMO contents with words, pictures or a bar code that can be scanned with smartphones. The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) would decide which ingredients would be considered genetically modified. The measure now goes to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass. Drawing praise from farmers, the bill sponsored by Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas and Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan is the latest attempt to introduce a national standard that would override state laws, including Vermont‚Äôs that some say is more stringent, and comes amid growing calls from consumers for greater transparency. ‚ÄúThis bipartisan bill ensures that consumers and families throughout the United States will have access, for the first time ever, to information about their food through a mandatory, nationwide label for food products with GMOs,‚Äù Stabenow said in a statement. A nationwide standard is favored by the food industry, which says state-by-state differences could inflate costs for labeling and distribution. But mandatory GMO labeling of any kind would still be seen as a loss for Big Food, which has spent millions lobbying against it. Farmers lobbied against the Vermont law, worrying that labeling stigmatizes GMO crops and could hurt demand for food containing those ingredients, but have applauded this law.     Critics like Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, say the bill‚Äôs vague language and allowance for electronic labels for scanning could limit its scope and create confusion. ‚ÄúWhen parents go to the store and purchase food, they have the right to know what is in the food their kids are going to be eating,‚Äù Sanders said on the floor of the Senate ahead of the vote. He said at a news conference this week that major food manufacturers have already begun labeling products with GMO ingredients to meet the new law in his home state. Another opponent of the bill, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, said it would institute weak federal requirements making it virtually impossible for consumers to access information about GMOs. Food ingredients like beet sugar and soybean oil, which can be derived from genetically-engineered crops but contain next to no genetic material by the time they are processed, may not fall under the law‚Äôs definition of a bioengineered food, critics say. GMO corn may also be excluded thanks to ambiguous language, some said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised concerns about the involvement of the USDA in a list of worries sent in a June 27 memo to the Senate Agriculture Committee. In a letter to Stabenow last week, the USDA‚Äôs general counsel tried to quell those worries, saying it would include commercially-grown GMO corn, soybeans, sugar and canola crops. The vast majority of corn, soybeans and sugar crops in the United States are produced from genetically-engineered seeds. The domestic sugar market has been strained by rising demand for non-GMO ingredients like cane sugar. The United States is the world‚Äôs largest market for foods made with genetically altered ingredients. Many popular processed foods are made with soybeans, corn and other biotech crops whose genetic traits have been manipulated, often to make them resistant to insects and pesticides. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fair to say that it‚Äôs not the ideal bill, but it is certainly the bill that can pass, which is the most important right now,‚Äù said American Soybean Association‚Äôs (ASA) director of policy communications Patrick Delaney. The association was part of the Coalition for Safe and Affordable Food, which lobbied for what labeling supporters termed the Deny Americans the Right to Know, or DARK Act, that would have made labeling voluntary. It was blocked by the Senate in March. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 "
State Department to conduct internal probe of Clinton email case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Thursday it will conduct an internal review of whether Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her aides mishandled classified information, after the Justice Department declined to bring criminal charges. The State Department said in April it had suspended plans for an internal review at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducted a yearlong probe of Clinton‚Äôs use of private email servers while she was secretary of state. ‚ÄúGiven the Department of Justice has now made its announcement, the State Department intends to conduct its internal review,‚Äù State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. ‚ÄúI cannot provide specific information about the Department‚Äôs review, including what information we are evaluating. We will aim to be as expeditious as possible, but we will not put artificial deadlines on the process,‚Äù he said. On Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she would accept the recommendations of the FBI not to bring criminal charges against Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday Clinton had been ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in the handling of classified information, and Republicans have criticized the decision not to prosecute. Comey told a congressional hearing on Thursday that FBI employees who mishandled classified material in the way Clinton did as secretary of state could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance.

FBI chief says his staff would face discipline for handling emails the way Clinton did,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday that FBI employees who mishandled classified material in the way Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance.   Comey addressed the issue at a House of Representatives committee hearing that lasted nearly five hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper that Clinton should be denied classified briefings during her campaign for the presidency. Comey, who said on Tuesday he would not recommend that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee face criminal charges, was asked at the hearing if Clinton should face administrative punishment for the way she handled her email. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs for me to recommend,‚Äù he said. Comey did say his employees in the Federal Bureau of Investigation would face discipline for the same behavior. ‚ÄúThey might get fired, they might lose their clearance, it might get suspended for 30 days,‚Äù Comey said. ‚ÄúThere would be some discipline.‚Äù Presidential candidates normally get access to classified information once they are formally nominated. As director of the FBI, Comey does not have the authority to revoke Clinton‚Äôs security privileges. A group of Republican senators on Thursday asked the State Department to immediately suspend clearances for Clinton and several current and former aides based on the agency‚Äôs findings.  The State Department said on Thursday it would conduct an internal review of Clinton‚Äôs handling of the emails now that the FBI investigation was over. The department said in April it had suspended plans for a review at the FBI‚Äôs request. ‚ÄúI cannot provide specific information about the Department‚Äôs review, including what information we are evaluating. We will aim to be as expeditious as possible, but we will not put artificial deadlines on the process,‚Äù State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. A Clinton spokesman on Thursday criticized the congressional hearing for its ‚Äúpartisan motivations,‚Äù and expressed confidence that Comey‚Äôs testimony had shut down any lingering ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù on the matter.  ‚ÄúDirector Comey‚Äôs testimony clearly knocked down a number of false Republican talking points and reconciled apparent contradictions between his previous remarks and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs public statements,‚Äù spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.  The issue of Clinton‚Äôs use of private email servers has cast a cloud over her campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election, raising questions among voters about her trustworthiness and judgment and giving her Republican presidential rival, Donald Trump, an avenue of attack. Comey‚Äôs testimony marked the first time he took questions publicly since his announcement the FBI was not recommending charges against Clinton. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch accepted the FBI recommendation and was to appear at another hearing next Tuesday.  Comey had disappointed some Republicans by only rebuking Clinton, not recommending charges against her, for what he called her ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of classified information while using private email servers.  Under persistent questioning at the hearing of the House Oversight Committee, Comey said Clinton did not break the law. ‚ÄúThe question I always look at is, is there evidence that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody engaged in conduct that violated a criminal statute. And my judgment here is there is not,‚Äù Comey said.    Comey also said Clinton knew her email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, was not authorized to receive classified information. But Clinton may not have had sufficiently sophisticated understanding to know the emails that passed through her personal server were classified, Comey said. Only three of the FBI-reviewed emails were explicitly marked as classified and those were marked with a ‚ÄúC‚Äù in the body of the email, not in the header, he said. Comey said his FBI team conducted its investigation of Clinton ‚Äúin an apolitical and professional way‚Äù and he had no reason to believe she had lied to the FBI. Clinton had said publicly she never sent or received any classified information. ‚ÄúI think there is a legitimate concern that there is a double standard, if your name isn‚Äôt Clinton or you are not part of the powerful elite that Lady Justice will act differently,‚Äù U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said to Comey at the beginning of the hearing. A Democratic member of the committee, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, defended Comey‚Äôs actions by saying: ‚ÄúI firmly believe your decision was based on conviction, not convenience.‚Äù Comey, a Republican who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and also served in the administration of former Republican President George W. Bush, has built a reputation as a straight shooter who does not bend to pressure from either party. He has differed sharply with the Obama administration, including over the case of General David Petraeus, who pleaded guilty after he knowingly shared classified information with his biographer and lover. Comey recommended Petraeus be charged with a felony, but then-Attorney General Eric Holder downgraded the charge to a misdemeanor. The hearing took place as Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get them behind his candidacy, discussing a variety of issues, including his campaign style. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you proud,‚Äù Trump told House Republicans, according to a participant, Representative Bill Flores.

Trump stars and spars with Republican lawmakers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump endured some blunt exchanges when he met Republican members of Congress on Thursday but several lawmakers, including past critics, emerged with encouraging words about their presumptive White House nominee. Republican aides cited good attendance from both houses of Congress at the two closed-door meetings, even though some lawmakers made a point of staying away, citing previous commitments. The New York businessman-turned-politician has sought in speeches and meetings in recent weeks to unite the party behind his unorthodox candidacy and to reassure Republican leaders about his conservative credentials. In a Miami speech on Friday, Trump will say the economic policies of Democrats like President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the party‚Äôs presumptive nominee, have harmed minorities, said Steve Moore, a Trump economic policy adviser.   Trump drew 41 of 54 Republican senators to the U.S. Senate meeting where he called out three senators who had been critical of his candidacy, according to Republican aides familiar with the meeting. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the meetings with lawmakers were positive and productive, adding characterizations of discord ‚Äúattributed to unnamed sources, are wholly inaccurate.‚Äù   Trump also met privately with Senator Ted Cruz, his former rival for the Republican nomination. They did not discuss an endorsement but Cruz did accept Trump‚Äôs invitation to speak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland the week of July 18, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said. At the first session on Thursday, with members of the House of Representatives, Trump shared a hug with House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who has often criticized Trump even while endorsing him, lawmakers said. They joked a bit about some of their past exchanges during an hour-long session, and Trump took questions. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you proud,‚Äù Representative Bill Flores quoted Trump as saying. Trump won grassroots support during months of state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election with a pledge to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. He regularly annoys party leaders with inflammatory remarks. Flores, a Texan who heads the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative grouping in Congress, had criticized Trump, including for having questioned a U.S. judge‚Äôs motives because of his Mexican ethnicity. Flores had said he wanted to see ‚Äúmore vision and less trash talk‚Äù from the presumptive nominee. After Thursday‚Äôs session, Flores said he felt better about Trump. ‚ÄúBased on what I have heard today, I‚Äôve got the confidence that you are going to see a lot more in terms of visionary messaging,‚Äù Flores said. ‚ÄúToday was extremely positive,‚Äù said New York Republican Peter King, another representative who has criticized Trump. ‚ÄúThere was not one negative moment.‚Äù But not everyone was won over. ‚ÄúI need to be persuaded,‚Äù said Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania who said he would not support either Trump or  Clinton. Trump‚Äôs session with Republican senators sounded more turbulent. The Washington Post reported details of a combative exchange between Trump and Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has expressed concern that Trump‚Äôs comments on immigration will cause Hispanic voters in the state to reject him. When Flake stood up and introduced himself, Trump told him, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been very critical of me,‚Äù the Post said. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm the other senator from Arizona ‚Äî the one who didn‚Äôt get captured ‚Äî and I want to talk to you about statements like that,‚Äù Flake responded, referring to Trump‚Äôs past dismissal of Senator John McCain‚Äôs record as a prisoner during the Vietnam war. The senator urged Trump to stop attacking Mexicans; Trump predicted that Flake would lose his re-election, at which point Flake informed Trump that Flake was not up for re-election this year. Flake‚Äôs spokesman Jason Samuels said the Post account was accurate. Trump also turned to Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has refused to endorse him, and ‚Äúsaid something along the lines of ‚ÄòSurely you don‚Äôt want Clinton,‚Äô‚Äù one Republican aide said of the session. Trump said he would win also in Illinois, the home state of a third Republican critic, Senator Mark Kirk, who is in a tight re-election race and recently withdrew his endorsement of Trump. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù Kirk told reporters several hours later. ‚ÄúI think Trump is going to get a vote like Alan Keyes got, which is about 28 percent,‚Äù Kirk said, referring to the Republican who ran unsuccessfully for senator against Obama in Illinois in 2004.   Trump‚Äôs Twitter posting as he left Washington showed no sign of discord. ‚ÄúVery interesting day! These are people who love our country!‚Äù he tweeted. ",politicsNews,"July 7, 2016 "
U.S. Democrats pressure Republicans for bipartisan Zika funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and congressional Democrats pressured Republicans on Thursday for bipartisan Zika-funding legislation, saying the public health battle against the mosquito-borne virus is being undercut by efforts to ram through a bill with less funding. But there was no sign that Republicans would abandon their $1.1 billion measure, raising the chance that Congress will leave the growing health crisis unattended until September.  In a conference call, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the lack of funding has made it difficult for the health agency to ramp up mosquito-control and diagnostic testing and pursue new research. President Barack Obama asked the Republican-controlled Congress in February for $1.9 billion in emergency funding to fight Zika. But as lawmakers prepare to leave for a seven-week recess on July 15, Senate Democrats who defeated the Republican measure last week predict it will only fail again. ‚ÄúWe are at the 11th hour and 59th minute before Congress is gone all summer,‚Äù said Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, which is among a number of southern U.S. states likely to be hard-hit by the Zika virus. U.S. health officials say Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.  Over the past few days, Obama has urged Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democrats to adopt a bipartisan approach. On Thursday, Democrats called on McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan to revive a bipartisan measure that passed the Senate in May. McConnell has said he would stick with the current legislation, which was agreed by House and Senate negotiators and has already passed the House.  A senior Senate Republican aide dismissed the call for change as ‚Äúcover‚Äù for Democratic efforts to block the Republican measure. A Ryan spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúWe hope Senate Democrats do the right thing and end their filibuster.‚Äù Even some Democratic aides expressed skepticism that McConnell or Ryan would change course.        The CDC is monitoring 320 pregnant U.S. women with laboratory evidence of Zika infection. In Puerto Rico, where Zika has been rampant for months, as many as 50 pregnant women are infected every day, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said. Altogether, there are more than 1,130 Zika cases in the United States, the CDC said. All contracted the virus outside the United States, in a lab or through unprotected sex.  Frieden said the CDC has spent most of the $222 million it has received for Zika in the United States on state and municipal efforts, funding, staffing and equipment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frankly difficult to navigate with so many unknowns,‚Äù Frieden said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we haven‚Äôt been able to do things like begin ramping up centers of excellence to improve the performance of diagnostic tests, of mosquito control and to begin some of the really in-depth studies.‚Äù Additional funding would also aid vaccine research and help community health centers in areas with the highest Zika transmission rates.  The Republican measure failed in the Senate on June 28 when Democrats objected to Republican provisions, including one to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving funds to combat what can be sexually transmitted infection. The legislation would also take money from battling the Ebola virus and from funds set aside to implement the Obamacare health insurance program in U.S. territories. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll force yet another failed vote on this cynical legislation and then pack their bags for the longest Senate vacation since 1954,‚Äù Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,600 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.

Sanders expected to endorse Clinton on Tuesday: New York Times,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Bernie Sanders is expected to endorse presidential rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday at a campaign event in New Hampshire, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Citing three Democrats who have been involved in the planning, the Times said the endorsement was partly the result of daily talks between the candidates‚Äô campaign managers about bringing them together and advancing Sanders‚Äô policy priorities. The Sanders campaign declined to comment. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has resisted endorsing Clinton in a show of party unity since she clinched the Democratic nomination last month. Sanders chose to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions on his liberal policy agenda and reforms to the Democratic Party nominating process. In a speech to supporters last month, Sanders vowed to help Clinton defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election but did not end his campaign. Sanders risked being left behind, however, as other prominent Democrats have rallied around Clinton, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the party‚Äôs liberal wing. Clinton, who shifted to the left under pressure from Sanders during the campaign, adopted another of his issues on Wednesday when she proposed eliminating tuition at public colleges and universities for in-state students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually. Sanders‚Äô endorsement is expected to ensure he has a prominent speaking slot at the Democratic convention later this month, the Times quoted the three Democrats as saying.

"Trump adviser, on Moscow visit, dodges questions about U.S. policy on Russia","MOSCOW (Reuters) - A foreign-policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump avoided all questions about how the United States should shape its policy toward Russia on a visit to Moscow on Thursday. Carter Page said at a lecture he gave to students and business figures organized by Moscow‚Äôs New Economic School that he did not want to comment on the U.S. election campaign. Page declined to say whether he was planning to meet anyone from the Kremlin, the Russian government or Foreign Ministry during his visit. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidential election, has made contradictory comments about Russia but made headlines with warm words for President Vladimir Putin.  Putin called Trump ‚Äúvery talented‚Äù, fuelling speculation the Kremlin would be pleased to see Trump in the White House, but later rowed back from those comments. In his lecture on Thursday, Trump‚Äôs adviser Page said Western governments had often had a hypocritical focus on democratization, corruption and inequality in the post-Soviet world. He also accused the United States and its partners of ‚Äúproactive steps to encourage regime change overseas‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis may understandably advance a certain level of insecurity,‚Äù Page said. Relations between the United States and Russia have deteriorated sharply under U.S. leader Barack Obama, undermined by disagreements over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. The Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over Russia‚Äôs annexation of Ukraine‚Äôs Crimea region and fights on the opposing side of the five-year-old Syrian civil war.

U.S. lawmakers blast Obama administration over ex-Guantanamo prisoner,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers sharply criticized President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration on Thursday over the disappearance of a former Guantanamo detainee, calling for an end to transfers from the prison because of fears former prisoners could launch attacks on Americans. They also raised concerns about reports that Jihad Diyab, a Syrian among six detainees resettled in Uruguay in December 2014, has disappeared and may now be in Brazil. Obama is working to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, where terrorism suspects have been held for 15 years, by transferring detainees not considered security threats to foreign countries. Republican lawmakers worry that the Obama administration is so eager to close the prison before he leaves office in January that it is sending detainees to countries that cannot ensure they will not return to the battlefield by joining militant groups that target Americans and U.S. allies. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about detainees who have every intent of killing American families,‚Äù Republican Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina said at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. The administration has considered sending Guantanamo detainees to a prison in South Carolina. The New York Times reported that Diyab said last month he was going on a religious retreat that would last into next week, and would be unreachable by telephone or email. Since then, some Uruguayan officials said they lost track of him and suggested he may have traveled to Brazil, the newspaper reported. ‚ÄúMany countries just aren‚Äôt up to the job,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, the committee‚Äôs chairman. ‚Äú... Yet the administration has sent Guantanamo terrorists to these countries anyway.‚Äù Republican and some Democratic committee members sharply questioned Lee Wolosky, the State Department‚Äôs special envoy for closing the Guantanamo detention center, and Paul Lewis, his Pentagon counterpart. Representative Jeff Duncan, another South Carolina Republican, said Diyab, charged with forging passports for al Qaeda, could pose a threat to the upcoming Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, if he were indeed at large in that country. The committee‚Äôs ranking Democrat, Representative Eliot Engel, who backs the closure of the detention center in Cuba, said it was important to keep the issue in perspective. ‚ÄúUnder no circumstances, in my opinion, is the Obama administration simply opening the gate and releasing dangerous terrorists onto the street,‚Äù Engel said.   Lewis and Wolosky said only 5 percent of detainees transferred since Obama became president have been confirmed to have returned to the battlefield. The percentage was higher for the over 500 released under President George W. Bush. There are currently 79 detainees at Guantanamo, of whom 29 are eligible for transfer. Wolosky acknowledged Diyab had been ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù from the time he was transferred to Uruguay. According to the Times, Diyab‚Äôs friends and supporters say he is off praying and will re-emerge soon. Obama has been trying to make good on his 2009 pledge to close the facility. But Congress has passed laws making it more difficult to do so, chiefly by barring transfers to U.S. prisons. Lawmakers are unlikely to lift those restrictions, especially in an election year.

House Speaker Ryan: all options on table over Democrats' gun sit-in,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday ‚Äúall options‚Äù were being considered over the possible discipline of House Democrats for protests they held on the House floor to call for action on gun-control measures. With Democrats already rejecting a Republican gun bill and warning of further protests, the Republican-controlled House appeared to be heading for renewed discord over gun restrictions following the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Ryan, who was speaking at a news conference, had previously said the House would vote this week on a measure intended to keep guns out of the hands of people the government suspects of involvement in violent extremism. But it is no longer clear when a vote might be held. Democrats say the Republican-backed legislation is inadequate because authorities would have only three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked. ",politicsNews,"July 7, 2016 "
IMF's Lagarde warns against Trump-style protectionism: FT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned in an interview published on Thursday that anti-trade policies like those championed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump risked a protectionist movement that could severely damage global growth. Lagarde told the Financial Times that with Britain‚Äôs vote to leave the European Union already casting a shadow over global growth, the imposition of new trade barriers in another larger economy could have ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù effects. ‚ÄúI think it would be quite disastrous, actually. Well I don‚Äôt think I should say disastrous because that is an excessive word and I should refrain from excessive words. But it would certainly have a negative impact on global growth,‚Äù she told the FT in response to a question about such policies. The newspaper said that while Lagarde made clear her negative views of anti-trade rhetoric and policies, she refrained from referring to Trump by name or singling out any politician. Lagarde also told the FT that she doubted that a prolonged period of uncertainty over Britain‚Äôs exit, without triggering formal separation negotiations, would be politically sustainable. ‚ÄúWe want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and decision making,‚Äù Lagarde told the newspaper. In a separate interview with Agence France Presse, Lagarde said Brexit was unlikely to cause a world recession, adding that the immediate effects would hurt the UK, with some spillover to the euro area. She told AFP that proposals in Britain to cut corporate tax rates to 15 percent from 20 percent to counter the damage caused by the UK‚Äôs EU divorce was a ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù that would hurt other economies.

"FBI director says Clinton did not lie, break law in email handling","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers on Thursday that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton did not lie to the FBI about her handling of emails as secretary of state and did not break the law. Comey told a Republican-led oversight panel in the U.S. House of Representatives that no reasonable prosecutor would charge Clinton with a crime over her use of private email servers while she was secretary of state, some of which were used to transmit classified information.

U.S. House speaker asks that Clinton be denied classified data,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Republicans in the U.S. Congress pressed for sanctions on Thursday against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information, with House Speaker Paul Ryan formally asking she be denied such information during the campaign. Ryan, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper saying denying Clinton access to classified information would be an appropriate sanction for her mishandling of classified data while she was secretary of state. Ten Republican senators said on Thursday they had written Secretary of State John Kerry asking that the State Department immediately suspend security clearances of Clinton and aides Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and other former State Department employees for security violations. The calls for sanctions against Clinton come after FBI Director James Comey rebuked her on Tuesday for ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of classified information while using private email servers for business while secretary of state during President Barack Obama‚Äôs first term. Comey recommended no criminal charges be filed but indicated administrative sanctions could be taken against Clinton or her aides. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday accepted Comey‚Äôs recommendation that no criminal charges were warranted and closed the case. Republican lawmakers and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump have expressed outrage that the case was not being pursued. Ryan, in a letter dated Wednesday, formally asked Clapper to ‚Äúrefrain from providing any classified information to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the duration of her candidacy for president‚Äù because of the FBI‚Äôs findings. The letter was obtained by Reuters from a source familiar with the matter. Ryan, a Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, said he was aware Clinton would begin receiving classified intelligence briefings after the Democratic National Convention if she is formally nominated as expected. Presidential candidates are customarily provided such briefings. ‚ÄúGiven the FBI‚Äôs findings, denying Secretary Clinton access to classified information certainly constitutes appropriate sanctions,‚Äù Ryan said in the letter. Republican senators, including former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, said in their letter to Kerry that it was clear from Comey‚Äôs comments on Tuesday that Clinton and her aides should have their security clearances immediately suspended if they still have them. ‚ÄúThere is simply no excuse for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs decision to set up a home-cooked email system which left sensitive and classified national security information vulnerable to theft and exploitation by America‚Äôs enemies,‚Äù the letter said.

"U.S. attorney general closes Clinton email probe, says no charges","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of private email while secretary of state is closed, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Wednesday, removing a legal cloud that threatened the presumptive Democratic nominee‚Äôs presidential bid.   Lynch said she accepted the Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs recommendations that no charges be brought in the probe, as Republicans made clear they would not let Clinton‚Äôs email headaches fade away easily. ‚ÄúI received and accepted their unanimous recommendation that the thorough, year-long investigation be closed and that no charges be brought against any individuals within the scope of the investigation,‚Äù Lynch said in a statement. With the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential and congressional elections beginning to heat up, Republicans called on the administration to make public key documents in the Clinton email case. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, speaking at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, accused Clinton, his likely Democratic opponent, of bribing Lynch to decide not to press charges. He was referring to reports, including in the New York Times  this week, that Clinton, if elected president, might ask Lynch to stay on as attorney general. ‚ÄúShe said she‚Äôs going to reappoint the attorney general and the attorney general is waiting to make a determination as to whether or not she‚Äôs guilty. And boy was that a fast determination, wow,‚Äù Trump said, adding, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bribery folks.‚Äù On Capitol Hill, Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 3 House of Representatives Republican, reacted to Lynch‚Äôs announcement by proclaiming: ‚ÄúSecretary Clinton broke the law and lied about it.‚Äù Senior Senate Republicans insisted that the FBI‚Äôs investigation be made available to the public, including a transcript of the more than three hours Clinton spent last Saturday in an interview conducted by the agency. Shortly before Lynch‚Äôs announcement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters, ‚ÄúI think the next step...is to compare what Hillary Clinton said to the FBI with what Hillary Clinton‚Äôs been saying to all of us over the last couple of years during this controversy.‚Äù In a blistering attack on Clinton, John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said on the Senate floor: ‚ÄúThe bottom line is Secretary Clinton actively sought out ways to hide her actions as much as possible‚Äù by using a private email account while heading the State Department. ‚ÄúAnd in so doing, she put our country at risk‚Äù by leaving those emails vulnerable to computer hackers. Democrats have questioned Republicans‚Äô motives and accused them of squandering taxpayer dollars with lengthy investigations that have failed to uncover illegal activities. ‚ÄúRepublicans are in such desperate shape because of Trump (that) they would seize upon anything‚Äù to divert attention, said Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. And Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement following Lynch‚Äôs announcement: ‚ÄúThis investigation is closed and that should be the end of this matter.‚Äù On Tuesday, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had been ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, but he recommended no criminal charges be filed in the case. Comey, who was deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration before becoming FBI director in 2013, is scheduled to testify on Thursday before a House committee, where Republicans and Democrats are expected to press him on his findings in the Clinton case. Lynch said she met on Wednesday afternoon with Comey and the career prosecutors and agents who had investigated whether Clinton broke the law as result of email servers kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home. One question is whether she mishandled classified information. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said on Wednesday it appeared Clinton received preferential treatment from the FBI. Asked whether a special prosecutor should be named to investigate the matter, Ryan said the House would not ‚Äúforeclose any options.‚Äù But Ryan did say that because of her messy handling of emails while serving as secretary of state, Clinton should be denied access to classified information during the campaign. Presidential candidates normally get such briefings once they are formally nominated. McConnell, Ryan‚Äôs Senate counterpart, stopped short of calling for such action. Clinton‚Äôs campaign was anxious to move on after Comey‚Äôs announcement, saying in a statement on Tuesday it was pleased with the FBI decision. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 "
Democrat Clinton to propose plan to protect small businesses,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday will unveil proposals to help small businesses fight fraudulent practices by larger firms, tactics her campaign will compare to the business record of her Republican rival, Donald Trump.   The plan would enhance legal protections for small businesses when large firms don‚Äôt pay their bills, increase federal regulatory enforcement, and expand working capital for small businesses, according to a Clinton official. The proposal comes a day after Clinton, in Atlantic City, lambasted Trump for what she described as profiting from exploiting workers in the slumping seaside town. A Reuters special report last year found Trump sometimes refuses to pay bills from contractors he has hired and then forces them to negotiate the final figure down. The new plan from the former secretary of state highlights a major division in the Democratic and Republican campaigns for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Trump, a New York real estate developer, often highlights his businesses as among his biggest qualifications for office, promising to do for the country what he says he has done for his companies.  But Clinton and others have harshly criticized Trump‚Äôs business practices and argue that running a country is a far different proposition from running a private enterprise.  Clinton and several campaign surrogates will take her new small business proposal to 10 states, including key election battlegrounds of Florida and Nevada, pointing to Donald Trump‚Äôs Atlantic City casino bankruptcies as a warning sign for voters.

"Trump rejects criticism, vents at news media in campaign speech","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday rejected criticism of his campaign tactics, in a wide-ranging speech defending his team‚Äôs use of a Jewish star and his own praise of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. At a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, Trump vented his frustration at a news media he feels is out to derail his candidacy and help Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, deriding CNN, in particular, as the ‚ÄúClinton News Network.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs hour-long performance was unlikely to reassure those Republicans who would like to see the New York businessman focus his message on attacking Clinton to rally the party behind him at the Cleveland convention from July 18 to 21 where he is to be formally nominated. He was particularly animated in defending his campaign‚Äôs use of what was seen to be a Jewish star in a tweet last week that described Clinton as corrupt. The star was replaced with a round emblem after the criticism, but the incident has generated days of controversy. Trump said he thought the star was more the shape of a sheriff‚Äôs badge. He described as ‚Äúsick people‚Äù those in the news media who called it a Jewish Star of David. Later, Trump tweeted an image of character from a book linked to Disney‚Äôs movie, ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù, that used a similarly shaped star on its cover. ‚ÄúWhere is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the ‚ÄòStar of David‚Äô also? Dishonest media! #Frozen,‚Äù he tweeted. In his Ohio speech, Trump also returned to the subject of Saddam after generating controversy on Tuesday by complimenting him for his handling of militants. Irritated by the criticism, Trump brought up Saddam again. ‚ÄúSo I said bad guy, really bad guy, but he was good at one thing: Killing terrorists‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt love Saddam Hussein. I hate Saddam Hussein. But he was damned good at killing terrorists,‚Äù Trump said. Trump also reacted to a mosquito that buzzed near his hand at the podium. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like mosquitoes, I never did. Speaking of mosquitoes, hello Hillary, how are you doing?‚Äù he said.

"Donald Trump, Republican Party boost fundraising in June","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee raised nearly $51 million for his presidential campaign in June, after he launched his first aggressive effort at raising cash, Trump‚Äôs organization reported on Wednesday. The most recent haul dwarfed the $3.1 million the Trump campaign raised in May. That low number prompted widespread concern among Republicans that the New York businessman, a newcomer to politics who largely bankrolled his primary campaign, would be unable to compete with Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs massive fundraising operation. For June, fundraising emails circulated by the Trump campaign attracted $26 million, in addition to more than $25 million raised in conjunction with the RNC through joint fundraising events in June and the last week of May. The joint funds are intended to help both Trump and candidates in other races, such as people running for Congress, in the Nov. 8 election. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, personally contributed $3.8 million in June, the campaign said, bringing the total contributions for the month to about $55 million. ‚ÄúWe just started our fundraising efforts in the last week of May and we are extremely pleased with the broad-based support in the last five weeks for the Trump Campaign and Trump Victory,‚Äù the campaign said in a statement. In June, Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, raised $68.5 million, including $40 million for her campaign and $28 million for the DNC and state victory funds. She began July with $44 million in cash on hand. While Trump‚Äôs June total far eclipsed the candidate‚Äôs past hauls, Lisa Spies, a Republican fundraiser who worked for Mitt Romney in 2012 and raised money for Jeb Bush in the 2016 primary, said the dollar count was much lower than the $106 million that Romney, the party‚Äôs standard-bearer in 2012, brought in during the same month four years ago. ‚ÄúThis is his low-hanging fruit, and it‚Äôs good, I‚Äôm not putting it down. But it needs to get much better than this quickly. He‚Äôs playing a game of catch-up right now,‚Äù Spies said. Clinton‚Äôs fundraising advantage has allowed her to build a vastly larger campaign infrastructure. Clinton already has extensive staff operations in the most important battleground states and has begun to run paid advertising. Trump has only a handful of staffers and has made no large television ad purchases. Trump beat 16 rivals in the Republican presidential race, but his free-wheeling style and some of his campaign pledges, such as his plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, have long worried some in the party establishment and he has struggled to unify Republicans behind him.  The Super PACs supporting Trump, which are permitted to raise and spend unlimited sums but are not allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign, have also struggled to get organized. While there was once a constellation of more than a dozen Super PACs backing him, most of his support has consolidated around Great America PAC, which is being run by veteran political operative Ed Rollins. The PAC is on target to raise $10 million before the July 18 start of the Republican National Convention, said Eric Beach, a top PAC official. They have already seen an uptick in fundraising, bringing in $5 million in June, doubling the May haul of $2.5 million. Great America PAC is using that money to run television ads, and plans to attack Clinton over her use of personal email servers during her time as secretary of state. The Super PAC supporting Clinton, Priorities USA, had raised $88 million by the end of May and had $51 million to spend. The group is already running ads attacking Trump. Trump got off to a slow start in fundraising, funding much of his primary campaign with his personal wealth in loans that totaled about $50 million. He announced last month he would forgive the loans to his campaign, intending to signal to potential donors that he would not use their funds to repay himself. He held his first fundraiser in late May and had several in June, including a high-dollar event in New York City and several fundraisers in Texas. Trump continues to promise to make contributions to his own campaign. In June, he launched an online fundraising effort by promising to match donations up to $2 million. Trump and Clinton both use joint fundraising agreements with their respective parties. The agreements allow the candidates to accept checks larger than the $5,400 limit that an individual can give to a campaign. Instead, the larger donations are divided up among the campaign, the national party and various state victory funds. All the money is then used to help elect the presidential candidate as well as other candidates. The campaigns and the political parties are permitted to coordinate how they spend that money.

U.S. Republicans reject Democratic funding proposals for opioids,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers in U.S. Congress on Wednesday rejected two Democratic amendments to provide nearly $1 billion in funding for bipartisan legislation intended to combat America‚Äôs opioid epidemic, aides said. The rejection, which came during a meeting of U.S. House of Representatives and Senate negotiators on the measure, could undermine Democratic support for final legislation that could come up for a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Friday. The House and Senate each passed its own versions of the legislation in the last few months. House and Senate Democratic lawmakers are now withholding their support for the final version of the bill, according to two Democratic aides. Democratic opposition could prove to be an obstacle, especially in the Senate, where lawmakers need 60 votes to move legislation forward.  Two amendments, from House and Senate Democrats, would have provided $920 million up front to finance program grants for states. Aides said the programs otherwise require completion of a lengthy appropriations process that could stall in a congressional session shortened by this year‚Äôs election campaign. Republican aides were not immediately available for comment. But House Republicans are separately considering a health spending measure that would provide more than $581 million to address opioid abuse. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra said on Wednesday it was only the latest instance in which legislation with bipartisan backing fell short on funding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs becoming a bit of a joke to say we‚Äôre concerned and want to do something, when the only thing we‚Äôll do is shell of what it actually takes,‚Äù he said.

Two leading Republicans shy away from being Trump's VP pick,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs list of potential vice presidential running mates got a little shorter on Wednesday when one prominent U.S. senator withdrew from consideration and a second said she wanted to focus on her home state. The moves by Bob Corker of Tennessee and Joni Ernst of Iowa could complicate Trump‚Äôs efforts to rally establishment Republicans behind his presidential bid. With Trump looking at a self-imposed deadline of July 15 to announce his pick, there was no indication that the wealthy businessman was anywhere close to reaching what is perhaps the most important decision he will make as the presumptive Republican nominee. Trump is looking to announce his running mate just ahead of the Republican National Convention, to be held July 18-21  in Cleveland, where he is expected to become the party‚Äôs official nominee. In Cincinnati, Ohio, on Wednesday, Trump campaigned with potential vice presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House of Representatives who is popular in conservative circles. Introducing Trump, Gingrich tried out the role of the No. 2 with a robust attack on presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her email practices, on the same day the Justice Department decided not to levy criminal charges over what the Federal Bureau of Investigation called her ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of classified information when she was secretary of state. ‚ÄúThere are two Americas. There‚Äôs the corrupt Washington of the old order. And there‚Äôs all the rest of us. I say to you, Enough!‚Äù Gingrich said. Trump liked what he heard. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs Newt, but if it‚Äôs Newt, nobody is going to be beating him in those debates,‚Äù Trump said.  Trump told Fox News he has 10 candidates on his vice presidential list, including two generals. One source said Indiana Governor Mike Pence is being pushed internally by some members of Trump‚Äôs inner circle. A former congressman, Pence met with Trump on Saturday. Corker, from Tennessee, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had wrestled privately over whether to be a contender for the No. 2 position, telling friends he had never been a surrogate for another politician. Corker spent eight hours at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, then campaigned with Trump in Raleigh, North Carolina. He told reporters he withdrew because ‚ÄúI just felt like I was far more suited for other types of service.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs a highly political role for the next four months,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI view myself as deep in substance and policy, and I just think there are better ways for me to serve in the public arena.‚Äù His withdrawal eliminates an important party establishment figure as Trump tries to broaden his appeal with plans to visit Republicans in the Senate and House on Capitol Hill on Thursday. ‚ÄúCorker‚Äôs withdrawal could be considered a canary in the coal mine with establishment Republicans who are convinced that Trump cannot stay on message and can‚Äôt stay focused on attacking Hillary Clinton without doing some type of damage to his campaign,‚Äù said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. Some Republicans felt Trump erred by not taking full political advantage of FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs statement on Tuesday that Clinton mishandled classified emails. In Raleigh, Trump sharply attacked Clinton but strayed from the message by saying the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had done a good job cracking down on militants. Ernst, a rising figure in the Republican Party, spent part of the Fourth of July holiday on Monday meeting with Trump. She seemed to be leaning against the vice presidential position, and told Politico, ‚ÄúI made that very clear to him that I‚Äôm focused on Iowa. I feel that I have a lot more to do in the United States Senate. And Iowa is where my heart is.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 "
"After FBI report, Clinton aides could find it harder to get security clearances","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI‚Äôs harsh criticism of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email system as U.S. secretary of state could make it difficult for some of her closest aides to keep or renew government security clearances, but it would not affect Clinton herself if she is elected president, experts said. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Tuesday an FBI investigation had found evidence that Clinton, now the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, and her aides ‚Äúwere extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information‚Äù at the State Department.  Comey said he would not recommend that the Justice Department bring criminal charges - a recommendation accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday - but the FBI director noted that people found to have been similarly careless often face consequences in the form of ‚Äúsecurity or administrative sanctions.‚Äù  Most administrative sanctions, anything from a reprimand to a dismissal, can‚Äôt be imposed on Clinton and three of her closest aides Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and Huma Abedin as they have already left government, experts of the government‚Äôs classified information regime said. But legal experts said that if Clinton aides were found to have treated classified material with extreme carelessness that could give the government reason to consider denying them a security clearance in the future or suspending or revoking one they may currently have.  ‚ÄúIf the system is fair and equitable, then they should all have difficulty maintaining or obtaining a security clearance in the future,‚Äù said Mark Zaid, a Washington D.C.-based attorney who specializes in national security matters. Steven Aftergood, a Federation of American Scientists expert on national security and classification policy, noted, however, that Comey had highlighted what he called a problematic security culture at the State Department. ‚ÄúSo it might be hard to penalize individuals for this episode if their entire agency embraced similar practices,‚Äù Aftergood said.  A Justice Department spokesperson declined to elaborate on Comey‚Äôs statement, which did not name any of the aides. The Clinton campaign did not respond to questions about the security clearances of Clinton, Mills, Sullivan and Abedin, nor did lawyers for the three aides.  Abedin, who has been a personal aide to Clinton for about 20 years, and Sullivan, Clinton‚Äôs policy director at the State Department, sent information the government now says is classified to Clinton‚Äôs unauthorized private email account, according to email records released by the State Department. It remains unclear if they sent any of the 110 emails that Comey said contained information that was classified at the time they were written. The only author of such emails he identified was Clinton herself. A small number of other department colleagues sent  information the government has since marked as classified to Clinton‚Äôs account less frequently, the records show. The government forbids handling classified government secrets outside secured channels it controls. Clinton has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information through her private email server. Both Abedin and Sullivan now hold senior roles in Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign and are widely expected to join a Clinton administration if she is elected on Nov. 8.  Mills, who also passed along information the government now deems classified, has continued to work as a lawyer for Clinton but has no formal role in the campaign. It unclear if she will seek a role in a Clinton administration. Some presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, and lawmakers could use any past criticism of an aide‚Äôs handling of government secrets as a reason to block their appointment to a Senate-confirmed job, said William J. Leonard, a former director of the federal government‚Äôs Information Security Oversight Office. The State Department declined to discuss individual cases and said that as a matter of policy it does not publicly disclose who has a security clearance. But it said it can apply security sanctions, such as putting a black mark on a person‚Äôs permanent personnel file that would come up in future background checks, even against former employees. For those former officials who maintain an active security clearance, they could lose it. ‚ÄúDepartment policy is to maintain files on personnel who are found to have mishandled information to guide current and potential future decisions about employment and security clearances,‚Äù John Kirby, a department spokesman, said in a statement.  Without knowing precisely what the FBI found about the actions of specific Clinton aides, it is impossible to say what  effect there may be on their current or future security clearances. Paul Ryan, the House Speaker and the most senior elected Republican official, said on Wednesday that Clinton should be denied the security clearance required to receive the customary intelligence briefing that government officials give to presidential nominees before the election. Presidents and other elected national officeholders are not required to have background checks to receive government secrets, according to experts and the Central Intelligence Agency. ‚ÄúIt would roil our system of representative democracy if a security official could say that the president ... can‚Äôt have a security clearance,‚Äù said McAdoo Gordon, an attorney with extensive experience in security clearance matters.

Clinton visits Atlantic City boardwalk to hit Trump on casino bankruptcies,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton visited the famous boardwalk in Atlantic City on Wednesday to highlight Republican rival Donald Trump‚Äôs casino bankruptcies, warning he would bring the same cutthroat approach to managing the U.S. economy. Clinton, standing next to the shuttered Trump Plaza casino that Trump once owned, said the real estate developer routinely profited from the financial ruin of workers in the economically depressed seaside resort town. ‚ÄúThe people he‚Äôs trying to convince to vote for him are the same people he‚Äôs been exploiting for years - working people, small-business people,‚Äù Clinton said. Clinton said Trump‚Äôs casino bankruptcies and numerous complaints against him by contractors showed he cannot be trusted to set economic policy from the White House. ‚ÄúHe makes over-the-top promises and says if people trust in him, put their faith in him, he‚Äôll deliver,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen everything falls apart, people get hurt, and Donald gets paid.‚Äù The Trump Plaza was one of four casinos Trump once owned in Atlantic City. He left the city after his last bankruptcy. Clinton frequently uses criticism of Trump‚Äôs business record to illustrate a principle campaign theme - that the wealthy New Yorker is only interested in boosting his financial bottom line, and not concerned about the economic struggles of working Americans. Clinton reminded supporters who gathered on the boardwalk under a boiling sun, within steps of the city‚Äôs beach, that Trump had promised to ‚Äúdo for the country what I did for my business.‚Äù She said Trump intentionally ran up hundreds of millions of debt on his companies, borrowed at high rates, defaulted on the loans, and left in the lurch the workers and contractors who relied on his casinos for income. ‚ÄúThat says everything you need to know about Donald Trump,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about what he can build. It‚Äôs about how much he can take.‚Äù Atlantic City has struggled economically in recent years as a series of casinos have closed. The city‚Äôs 10 percent unemployment rate is nearly double the national average, and closed buildings pockmark its boardwalk. In an emailed statement, Trump defended his bankruptcy filings on casinos and other projects as a commonly used practice to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs. ‚ÄúI created thousands of jobs and made a lot of money in Atlantic City, which was what, as a businessman, I am supposed to do for my company and my family ‚Äì and as President I will make America rich again,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNobody understands the economy like I do and no one, especially not Crooked Hillary Clinton, will do more for the economy than I will.‚Äù  After the speech, Clinton drove a few blocks to shake hands with dozens of striking workers outside the Trump Taj Mahal, another of the casinos that Trump once owned. Her attack on Trump‚Äôs business dealings came as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee blasted her integrity following an FBI report that criticized her use of private email during her tenure as secretary of state. Clinton did not address the email issue during her stop in Atlantic City. On Tuesday, FBI Director James Comey said the agency would recommend no criminal charges against Clinton for her use of private email servers. But Comey rebuked her for what he said was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of classified material on her email servers, and contradicted her claims that she never transmitted or received classified material on that email system. Republican lawmakers criticized Comey for what they saw as lax treatment of Clinton, and on Wednesday, committee chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, announced that Comey will testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday to explain the bureau‚Äôs ‚Äúsurprising and confusing‚Äù recommendation. The FBI has been investigating whether Clinton broke the law as result of personal email servers kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, including whether she mishandled classified information on the servers.

Clinton campaign to focus on key states in election: memo,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign laid out states critical to the U.S. presidential election in a memo to supporters dated Wednesday, including six with key minority populations - Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, Colorado and Nevada. The memo, sent to ‚Äúinterested parties‚Äù from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, also set a goal of raking in $4 million a day between now and the Nov. 8 election, or around $500 million total. The memo, which was shared with Reuters by a Clinton supporter, emphasized the importance of boosting turnout among minority voters in the race against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. ‚ÄúIf we fail to turn out African-American voters in Ohio, North Carolina or Virginia, we will lose. If we fail to turn out Hispanic voters in Florida, Colorado or Nevada, we will lose,‚Äù Mook wrote. ¬† ‚ÄúIf we fail to turn out Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters in Nevada or Virginia, we will lose.

The campaign declined to comment. Clinton‚Äôs lead over Trump widened to 13 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. The poll showed 46 percent of likely voters supporting Clinton, with 33 percent backing Trump. But 22 percent said they would not support either candidate. That support is lopsided among different racial and ethnic groups.

Sanders endorsement of Clinton could come as early as next week: ABC News,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton could receive her rival Bernie Sanders‚Äô endorsement at a public event next week, ABC News reported on Wednesday, citing unnamed sources close to the Sanders campaign. The two campaigns are discussing the matter and ‚ÄúSanders‚Äô endorsement of Clinton could come sometime next week, possibly at an event in New Hampshire,‚Äù ABC News said. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, said last month he would vote for the former secretary of state in the Nov. 8 election to stop likely Republican nominee Donald Trump. But he has not quit the race and has said he will continue to push for a liberal agenda heading into the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia from July 25 to 28, when Clinton‚Äôs nomination is expected to become official.

U.S. lawmakers to debate measures to block Boeing aircraft sale to Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel will debate legislation on Thursday intended to block Boeing Co‚Äôs planned sale of dozens of commercial aircraft to Iran, which could also affect other planemakers, including Airbus if they became law. A Financial Services subcommittee will debate three measures, including one that would prohibit the U.S. Treasury from licensing the sale announced last month. Another would bar the Treasury secretary for authorizing transactions by U.S. financial institutions connected to the export of aircraft. A third measure would bar the Export-Import Bank from financing involving any entity that does business with Iran or provides financing to another entity to facilitate transactions with Iran. ‚ÄúI am extremely concerned that by relaxing the rules, the Obama administration has allowed U.S. companies to be complicit in weaponizing the Iranian regime,‚Äù Representative Bill Huizenga, chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, said in a statement on Wednesday. If the bills became law, they would affect other firms‚Äô sales to Iran because virtually all modern jets have more than 10 percent U.S. content, the threshold for requiring export licenses. A House committee aide said the full financial services committee was likely to approve the bills, but a vote had not yet been scheduled. However, the measures showed the extent of concern by Republicans, who control majorities in both the House and Senate, about the Iran deal and the potential Boeing sale. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, are expected to oppose the legislation. While most congressional Democrats backed the Iran deal announced a year ago, every Republican U.S. lawmaker opposed the pact in which the United States and international partners agreed to ease crippling economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curtailing its nuclear program. When news of the Boeing deal emerged, several Republicans in Congress worried that it could threaten U.S. national security. Asked about those concerns last month, a Boeing executive noted last month that the Obama administration considered implementation of the nuclear pact ‚Äúcritical‚Äù to national security. A ‚Äúmemorandum of agreement‚Äù (MOA) calls for IranAir to buy a total of 80 aircraft from Boeing and lease a further 29 with Boeing‚Äôs support. Deliveries of the purchased jets are scheduled to start in 2017 and run through 2025. An Iranian official told Reuters some officials in Tehran are concerned about the legislation, arguing that if such measures become law they could endanger implementation of the nuclear deal by intensifying pressure on Iran President Hassan Rouhani to take a harder line in his dealings with the United States and its allies.

Ryan says Congress considering action on Clinton's email use,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday said lawmakers are examining whether there is any action they can take over Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email practices while secretary of state, saying it appeared she had received preferential treatment from the FBI. Ryan, a Republican, said the House of Representatives would not ‚Äúforeclose any options‚Äù when asked whether a special prosecutor was necessary to get to the bottom of the Democratic presidential candidate‚Äôs use of a private email server while she ran the State Department. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Tuesday it would not recommend charges regarding Clinton‚Äôs email, although FBI Director James Comey rebuked the Democratic U.S. presidential candidate for ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of classified information.  The FBI decision, Ryan said, ‚Äúlooks like‚Äù preferential treatment for Clinton. Ryan, who was the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, said Director of National Intelligence James Clapper should deny Clinton access to classified information during the campaign, although presidential candidates normally get such access once they are formally nominated. Clinton‚Äôs campaign, responding to Ryan‚Äôs remarks, said House Republicans appeared to be trying to launch another ‚Äúsham of an inquiry‚Äù against Clinton now that they had ended their two-year probe of the deaths of four Americans at a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi while Clinton was secretary of state. ‚ÄúFor weeks Republicans have said they trusted FBI Director Comey to lead an independent review into Secretary Clinton‚Äôs emails, but now they are second-guessing his judgment because his findings do not align with their conspiracy theories,‚Äù campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said in an emailed statement. The campaign said on Tuesday it was pleased with the FBI‚Äôs decision, noting that the candidate has said repeatedly that it was a mistake to use her personal email while secretary of state. Ryan noted that two House committees are looking into the Clinton email matter ‚Äî the Judiciary committee and the Oversight Committee, where Comey has been invited to testify on Thursday. ‚ÄúHe (Comey) did say that short of prosecution, some kind of administrative action might be in order,‚Äù Ryan said, adding: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs the least we can do, given how she was so reckless in handling classified material and sending classified information on insecure servers.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo look, I think that‚Äôs something that the administration should do on its own, but we‚Äôll look into seeing if that‚Äôs something we can do as well,‚Äù Ryan said. Senate Republican leaders said they thought Clinton‚Äôs testimony to the FBI should be released to the public. But Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid dismissed as political the Republican calls for Clinton to stop getting classified information. ‚ÄúThe Republicans are in such desperate shape because of (Republican presidential candidate Donald) Trump, they would seize upon anything,‚Äù Reid told reporters. He said the FBI investigation had been thorough. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over and it‚Äôs time to move on.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 "
John Kerry commits more U.S. military aid for ex-Soviet Georgia,"TBILISI (Reuters) - Secretary of State John Kerry told ex-Soviet Georgia that the United States would help it bolster its army as he reassured a close U.S. ally days before a NATO summit expected to focus on the threat a resurgent Russia poses. Kerry, on his first visit to Georgia as Secretary of State, made the commitment ahead of a NATO summit in Warsaw on Friday at which members of the Western military alliance plan to announce action to deter possible Russian military aggression. Georgia and former Soviet states such as Moldova and Ukraine have become increasingly concerned by Russia‚Äôs intentions after the Kremlin annexed Ukraine‚Äôs Crimea in 2014 and launched air strikes in Syria last year. Moscow says such fears are unfounded and based on what it calls anti-Russian hysteria.   In a memorandum of understanding signed on Wednesday by Kerry and Georgian Prime Minister Georgy Kvirikashvili, the United States promised to bolster Georgia‚Äôs ability to defend itself against potential threats. That meant greater military and security cooperation, enhanced information sharing, and help building up defense capacity, such as improving combat readiness and supporting defense procurement, the document said. Until now, U.S. security support has focused on training Georgian troops for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. ‚ÄúThe United States stands firm in its commitment to Georgia‚Äôs sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders,‚Äù Kerry told reporters. Georgia, which is crisscrossed by strategically important oil and gas pipelines, fought and lost a short war with Russia in 2008. Moscow then recognized two breakaway pro-Kremlin Georgian regions - South Ossetia and Abkhazia - as independent countries, though most other countries have not. ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs occupation and militarization of parts of Georgia‚Äôs territory are unacceptable,‚Äù said Kerry. ‚ÄúWe continue to call on Russia to fulfill its obligations under the 2008 ceasefire agreement, including a withdrawal of its forces to pre-conflict positions.‚Äù Moscow for its part has accused the West, notably Washington, of stirring anti-Russian feelings in former Soviet states it deems part of its own sphere of influence. Kerry visits Ukraine next, on Thursday, before heading to Warsaw to join U.S. President Barack Obama for the NATO summit. In Ukraine, Kerry‚Äôs third visit there since Russia annexed Crimea, he will focus on the implementation of the Minsk peace accords and the country‚Äôs reform agenda. It will be Kerry‚Äôs first chance to meet new Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 "
U.S. House Republicans battle each other on gun control,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A divided Republican Party on Wednesday fought over gun control legislation that was cobbled together following last month‚Äôs mass shooting in Orlando, raising questions over U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan‚Äôs ability to get the measure passed. While Democrats have said the gun control proposal put forward by Republican leaders was too weak, an influential group of approximately 40 conservative House Republicans announced their opposition as well, saying the plan did not do enough to protect gun buyers. The legislation fails ‚Äúto do enough to address the threat of radical Islamic terrorism,‚Äù according to a statement by the conservative Freedom Caucus. The group also complained of ‚Äúthe inclusion of gun control provisions that fail to adequately protect due process.‚Äù With the Republican leadership‚Äôs legislation under attack from both liberals and conservatives, it was unclear whether Ryan could muster the 218 votes he would need for passage in the House of Representatives. Last month, the Senate failed to approve any of several competing Republican and Democratic gun control proposals offered in the wake of the June 12 shooting at a gay night club in Orlando that killed 49 and injured 53 others. During the Senate debate, Democratic lawmakers staged a sit-in on the House floor to pressure Republican leaders to pass legislation expanding background checks on gun sales and blocking gun purchases by people on terrorism watch lists. The Republican leadership bill, announced last Friday, would give the government three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked. Ryan said Wednesday that he intended to bring it to the floor for a vote this week or next, but also noted changes were being sought by numerous lawmakers. ‚ÄúThe last thing we‚Äôre going to do is rush something to the floor that we don‚Äôt have right,‚Äù Ryan said. Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, a Freedom Caucus member, said he objected to Ryan pushing the bill without allowing it to be processed by relevant committees first. Salmon said that Ryan told House Republicans in a closed meeting that he was rushing the legislation to the House floor because ‚Äúthere are members that need to have this vote‚Äù for political reasons in swing districts that could go either Republican or Democratic in the Nov. 8 elections. Democrats, meanwhile, continued to pressure Ryan for votes on their more sweeping gun control measures. Representative John Larson of Connecticut, a ringleader of the Democrats‚Äô sit-in, said his fellow Democrats plan to support Republican mental health legislation that could help avert some mass shootings. Larson added he hoped it would be seen as an olive branch to Republicans toward progress on gun control. Scores of gun control advocates demonstrated outside the House chamber in sweltering heat on Wednesday morning, as 91 people wearing orange t-shirts stood on the steps leading to the House demanding action. They represented the 91 people who, according to government statistics, die each day in the United States from gun violence. Many of them die as a result of suicide. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 "
"Clinton offers plan to freeze some college debt, cut tuition","(Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Wednesday proposed a temporary freeze on some student debt and the cutting of college tuition entirely for some families, focusing on an issue important to supporters of her rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton‚Äôs latest proposal includes a three-month moratorium for federal student loan payments and a new measure to eliminate in-state college tuition for families whose income does not exceed $125,000, according to a release from her campaign. The proposal builds on her earlier plan for easing student debt loads for higher education. Clinton, the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Party nominee, is looking to win over supporters of Sanders, the Vermont senator who was her main opponent for the nomination as he consistently sought to push the party left. The presumptive Republican nominee, businessman Donald Trump, also has courted Sanders‚Äô voters, trying to use his outsider appeal to bring them over to his campaign. On Wednesday, Clinton proposed using executive action to offer a three-month moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers to offer help for borrowers to consolidate loans and find other methods to reduce their payments.  She previously has released proposals to increase access to tuition grants, push for income-based repayments, and - like Sanders - to allow graduates to refinance student loans at lower interest rates. Sanders praised the new Clinton measures on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he wanted ‚Äúto take this opportunity to applaud Secretary Clinton.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 "

Senator John McCain, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he welcomed Obama‚Äôs decision but added in a statement: ‚ÄúThat said, when the President himself describes the security situation in Afghanistan as ‚Äòprecarious,‚Äô it is difficult to discern any strategic rationale for withdrawing 1,400 U.S. troops by the end of the year.‚Äù   ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 "
"Obama, in shift, says he will keep 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan until 2017","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, calling Afghanistan‚Äôs security situation precarious, said on Wednesday he will keep U.S. troop levels there at 8,400 through the end of his administration rather than reducing them to 5,500 by year‚Äôs end as previously planned. Obama, in a statement at the White House, said the role of U.S. forces in Afghanistan will remain unchanged: training and advising Afghan police and troops, and supporting counterterrorism missions against the Taliban and other groups. Obama‚Äôs presidency ends in January. Obama‚Äôs plan still calls for a reduction in U.S. troop levels from the current roughly 9,800, but not as much as previously planned. Obama, who took office in 2009 pledging to wind down the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he had ended America‚Äôs combat mission in Afghanistan. But he acknowledged that security concerns persist. ‚ÄúThe security situation in Afghanistan remains precarious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThe Taliban remains a threat. They‚Äôve gained ground in some places.‚Äù Taliban forces now hold more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, according to recent United Nations estimates. The Islamic State group has also established a small presence in Afghanistan. Obama‚Äôs decision, which came after a review submitted last month by the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army General John Nicholson, drew some criticism inside and outside his administration. Some Pentagon officials said that it does nothing to address the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disappointing that the administration thinks that troop numbers are a substitute for a more comprehensive strategy,‚Äù said a U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúThis is neither the reduction that the White House seems to have wanted nor the current numbers that don‚Äôt seem to be sufficient to deal with the security problem.‚Äù Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, criticized what he said was a new cap on U.S. troop levels. ‚ÄúIt is time that the president level with the American people about what it will really take to achieve our goals in Afghanistan, and how much it will cost,‚Äù Thornberry said in a statement.  Obama spoke in advance of a NATO summit on Friday and Saturday in Warsaw, Poland, where alliance members are expected to confirm their support for the Kabul government. In addition to the U.S. forces, there are about 3,000 other international troops in Afghanistan. U.S. troops have been in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion launched by Obama‚Äôs predecessor, George W. Bush, that toppled the Taliban leaders who harbored the al Qaeda organization responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States that killed about 3,000 people. It is America‚Äôs longest war.

Rebuke of Clinton over email use creates opening for Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI report scolding Democrat Hillary Clinton over her email practices as secretary of state plays into a chief vulnerability that her rival, Republican Donald Trump, hopes to exploit ‚Äì wariness among U.S. voters about her trustworthiness. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said the Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs recommendation against criminal charges for Clinton means the email matter ‚Äúis now resolved.‚Äù Yet even as he removed the threat of charges against the Democratic candidate, FBI Director James Comey described Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified information as ‚Äúextremely careless.‚Äù Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, seized on that comment. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about serious stuff,‚Äù he told a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. ‚ÄúThe laws are very explicit.‚Äù The New York businessman has been struggling to unify the party around his candidacy, and Republicans say Trump could use the issue to heal some of the rifts within his party while motivating conservatives to go to the polls in the Nov. 8 election. Indeed, a main element of Trump‚Äôs strategy for winning over Republicans who are lukewarm on his candidacy is to emphasize the importance of keeping Clinton out of the White House. ‚ÄúClinton won the ‚ÄòComey primary‚Äô but Trump has the opportunity to drive home the lack of trust theme,‚Äù said Republican strategist Scott Reed. A Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 1-11 found that a majority of American adults do not think Clinton is an honest person. This included 89 percent of Republicans, 72 percent of independents and 36 percent of Democrats. More than a quarter, 27 percent, of Clinton‚Äôs own supporters did not think she is an honest person, according to the poll. Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf said Clinton needs to move quickly to get past the email episode and talk about issues central to her campaign. He predicted the issue will be short-lived as voters focus on the candidates‚Äô vice presidential running mates, the nominating conventions and fall debates. ‚ÄúShe made a mistake here, there‚Äôs no question about it,‚Äù said Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist who was chief strategist for 2004 nominee John Kerry, the current secretary of state.  ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs also justice in what she says, that for 24 years the Republicans have relentlessly gone after Bill and Hillary Clinton. That has its impact and that impact you can see in her trust numbers. But this decision, despite how anybody spins, it not only helps her but in my view was indispensable to her,‚Äù Shrum said. Hours after Comey‚Äôs announcement, Trump‚Äôs campaign sent an email soliciting money based on the Clinton email controversy.  The big question for Republicans is whether their presumptive presidential nominee will be able to prosecute the case effectively against Clinton since he is still at war with fellow Republicans and has little in the way of campaign funds to pay for TV ads against her. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way that Clinton can use this to raise anger at Republicans,‚Äù said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. ‚ÄúBut the Republicans can certainly use this to raise anger at Clinton and the Democrats. Anger is a great motivator to get people out to vote.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs initial response showed why Republicans continue to have concerns about him. Interviewed by Fox News‚Äô Bill O‚ÄôReilly, Trump spent as much time criticizing Comey as he did Clinton. Comey is respected by Republicans and Democrats alike. ‚ÄúI have such respect for the FBI that I just don‚Äôt understand what happened here,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúEverybody knows she‚Äôs extremely guilty. And they really said she was guilty today and then they said we‚Äôre not going to prosecute.‚Äù Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, called the FBI report a ‚Äúdisqualifying event‚Äù for Clinton. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs singular focus should be that she acted inappropriately. But Trump has a knack for distracting from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs scandals with his gaffes and missteps,‚Äù he said. Trump has been fighting allegations of anti-Semitism in recent days over his campaign‚Äôs use of a Jewish star in a tweet attacking Clinton as corrupt. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 "
"Clinton 'extremely careless' with emails, but FBI recommends no charges","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI recommended on Tuesday that no criminal charges be filed over Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of private email servers while she was secretary of state, but rebuked the Democratic U.S. presidential candidate for ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of classified information. While FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs announcement lifted a cloud of uncertainty that had loomed over Clinton‚Äôs White House campaign, his strong criticism of her judgment ignited a new attack on her over the email issue by Donald Trump, her likely Republican opponent in the Nov. 8 election. Comey‚Äôs comments are likely to reinforce what polls show are widespread public concerns about Clinton‚Äôs honesty and trustworthiness. Republicans have pointed to the controversy as evidence that she considered herself above the law. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the highest- ranking elected U.S. Republican, said in a statement that Comey‚Äôs announcement ‚Äúdefies explanation.‚Äù Ryan called on the FBI to release all of its findings in the case and said Comey would be called to testify before the House Oversight Committee. ‚ÄúWe need to know more,‚Äù Ryan told Fox News.  In a lengthy statement on the Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs conclusions from its yearlong investigation, Comey directly contradicted statements Clinton has made while defending her use of the private email setup. He said, for example, that the FBI found at least 110 emails that contained classified information when they were sent,  although Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information on her private servers. ‚ÄúAlthough we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of the classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,‚Äù Comey said. But he said the FBI concluded ‚Äúno reasonable prosecutor‚Äù would bring charges. ‚ÄúAlthough the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,‚Äù Comey told reporters in Washington. His recommendation will likely stand. The country‚Äôs top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, said on Friday she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI director on whether to charge Clinton for mishandling emails. Clinton‚Äôs campaign was anxious to move on after Comey‚Äôs announcement, saying in a statement it was pleased with the FBI decision. ‚ÄúAs the secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email, and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved,‚Äù spokesman Brian Fallon said. He did not respond to questions about Comey‚Äôs rebuttal of the main arguments Clinton has offered in defense of her use of private email. At a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Tuesday night, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said the controversy should disqualify Clinton from being president and that her email system may well have been hacked by U.S. enemies. ‚ÄúOur enemies may have a blackmail file on crooked Hillary and this alone means that she should not be allowed to serve as president of the United States,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe now know that she lied to the country when she said that she did not send classified information on her server. She lied!‚Äù Following Comey‚Äôs late-morning remarks, Clinton became one of the top trending topics on Twitter, with about 671,000 tweets posted by 4 p.m. (2000 GMT). The overall sentiment was more negative than positive, with about two negative tweets for every positive one, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. The FBI director‚Äôs announcement came hours before Clinton‚Äôs first campaign appearance with President Barack Obama, in Charlotte, North Carolina, where neither Obama nor Clinton mentioned the email probe. It also came less than three weeks before the Democratic National Convention at which Clinton is to be nominated as the party‚Äôs candidate for the November election. The FBI has been investigating whether Clinton broke the law as result of personal email servers kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One question is whether she mishandled classified information on the servers. As the investigation wound up, Clinton underwent a voluntary 3-1/2-hour interview with the FBI on Saturday in Washington. Comey said the FBI did not find that Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate the law, and that there was no ‚Äúintentional misconduct‚Äù by her lawyers who sorted her emails. He said her staff should have known Clinton‚Äôs private email was an improper place for classified information, but added there was no evidence anyone had hacked Clinton‚Äôs communications. Comey said, however, that ‚Äúhostile actors‚Äù gained access to email accounts of people with whom Clinton corresponded  regularly. He also said she used email extensively while traveling ‚Äúin territory of sophisticated adversaries.‚Äù Experts routinely advise U.S. government officials not to bring important digital information to countries with a track record of aggressive cyber activity. Clinton traveled to more than 100 countries during her four years as top U.S. diplomat, including trips to China and Russia, considered among the most sophisticated U.S. cyber adversaries. The FBI found 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained information that was classified at the time the messages were sent, Comey said. Eight of those chains contained ‚Äútop-secret‚Äù information, the highest level of government classification for material that could harm national security. A further 36 email chains contained ‚Äúsecret‚Äù information, and eight ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù information, he said. Agents also found three classified emails among the thousands Clinton never returned to the State Department. Comey said there were no previous cases that supported filing criminal charges against Clinton. Other cases had involved intentional mishandling of information, he said. Last year, the FBI recommended that former CIA Director David Petraeus be charged with a felony for his mishandling of classified information with his biographer, with whom he was having an affair.  In that case, however, the FBI had evidence that Petraeus knew the information was highly classified. Petraeus eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information. Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation of Clinton, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. Republican criticism of the process heated up after Clinton‚Äôs husband, former President Bill Clinton, met privately with Lynch in Phoenix last week. Lynch, who was appointed by Obama, said later she regretted the meeting and that she and the former president did not discuss the investigation. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 "
Lawyers: Legal precedent clears Clinton in email investigation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In declining to seek prosecution of Hillary Clinton, FBI Director James Comey said the former Secretary of State‚Äôs handling of classified emails was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù - conduct, legal experts said, that falls short of ‚Äúgross negligence,‚Äù a standard for criminal charges under the Espionage Act. ‚ÄúAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,‚Äù Comey said in a news conference Tuesday detailing the FBI investigation and his decision. Several legal experts agreed with Comey‚Äôs conclusion that there was no recent precedent for bringing such a case without evidence of willful intent or gross negligence, and they said it would have been difficult to convince a jury to convict Clinton based on the evidence. ‚ÄúExtreme carelessness doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate into gross negligence,‚Äù said Laurie Levenson, a professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and former federal prosecutor.  ‚ÄúThe only times I have seen these statutes used has been situations in which people knew they were disclosing classified, confidential information, or they could show they didn‚Äôt really care,‚Äù Levenson said.  Comey said investigators determined that Clinton exchanged 110 emails that contained government secrets and that she and her staff should have known the information was classified. But unlike other cases prosecuted under the Espionage Act, the FBI has not suggested that Clinton¬†intentionally shared¬†government secrets with people not authorized to see them. The statute for charging gross negligence under the Espionage Act, written in 1917, requires the information be ‚Äúremoved from its proper place,‚Äù a tough legal requirement in the digital age, said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at University of Texas. Vladeck said the law is not ‚Äúwell suited for careless discussion of information in unsecured media that doesn‚Äôt dispossess the government of that information or direct it right into the hands of a foreign power.‚Äù  Previous cases charged under the Espionage Act have shown intent, experts said. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell said Comey‚Äôs decision was ‚Äúcompletely consistent‚Äù with every case brought for leaking classified government information.  Defendants in other cases include Stephen Kim, Lowell‚Äôs client who pleaded guilty to leaking State Department documents to the press, as well as former C.I.A. Director General David Petraeus. He admitted to keeping classified information, which he would also share with his biographer, in his home, while telling the government he had returned all such information. ‚ÄúThe one common denominator of all such cases is that the individual involved intentionally sent material to those not authorized to receive it, like the press, like a foreign government,‚Äù Lowell said. Comey said the FBI ‚Äúdid not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information.‚Äù But he said it did find ‚Äúevidence that they were extremely careless in their handling a very sensitive, highly classified information.‚Äù His recommendation, which Attorney General Loretta Lynch previously said she would accept, angered Republicans who said her actions should be punished.  Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump reacted to the news from his Twitter account, saying, ‚ÄúThe system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less.‚Äù In that case, the FBI recommended a felony charge. But Attorney General Eric Holder pursued a misdemeanor under another part of the law, and Petraeus pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years probation in 2015.  The FBI had recordings of Petraeus acknowledging the information in notebooks in his home was highly classified. Petraeus also admitted to lying to the FBI about sharing the information with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and lover. Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists‚Äô Project on Government Secrecy, said Clinton‚Äôs cooperation with FBI investigators also may have helped her avoid charges. ‚ÄúThere was no obstruction of justice, no failure to cooperate truthfully with investigators, no concealment of her activity,‚Äù Aftergood said. Legal precedent suggests that Clinton is unlikely to face a misdemeanor charge for recklessness because recent cases that ended with misdemeanors began as much larger felony charges against individuals who intended to leak information. In 2010, Thomas Drake, a whistleblower from the NationalSecurity Agency who helped expose the government‚Äôs warrantless surveillance of Americans, was charged with espionage after the government accused him of bringing five classified documents home. He denied the accusation, and those charges were dropped. Drake pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer. ‚ÄúSomebody needs to ask Comey about my case,‚Äù Drake, who now works at an Apple store in Maryland, wrote in an email late Tuesday. Former president Bill Clinton‚Äôs national security adviser pleaded guilty in 2005 to smuggling classified documents out of the National Archives by stuffing them under his clothes.

U.S. Republicans push back on Democratic gun-control efforts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Republicans on Tuesday resisted Democratic demands for a vote on gun-control measures and warned that some could face punishment for an unusual sit-in last month that tied up the House of Representatives for 25 hours. With Democrats already rejecting a Republican gun bill and warning of further protests, the Republican-controlled House appeared to be heading for renewed discord over gun restrictions following the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. House Speaker Paul Ryan met for about 30 minutes on Tuesday with two Democrats who led the sit-in: Representatives John Lewis of Georgia and John Larson of Connecticut. The Democrats said they would ask Ryan for a vote on two Democratic-backed measures but left the meeting without speaking to reporters. ‚ÄúThe path ahead ... will be discussed and determined by the majority in the coming days,‚Äù Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said later in a statement. The measures sought by Democrats would expand background checks for gun purchases and allow the government to block gun sales to suspected extremists without first getting a judge‚Äôs approval.   Hours before the meeting, Ryan suggested a vote on the Democratic legislation was unlikely, telling a Milwaukee radio station: ‚ÄúThe last thing we are going to do is surrender the floor over to these kinds of tactics when we know it‚Äôs going to compromise the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.‚Äù House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said separately that he and Ryan would meet this week with the chamber‚Äôs top enforcement official to talk about reports that some Democrats at the June 22-23 sit-in engaged in ‚Äúintimidation‚Äù while carrying out their protest. Ryan has announced that the House will vote this week on a measure intended to keep guns out of the hands of people the government suspects of involvement in violent extremism. But Democrats say the legislation is inadequate because authorities would have only three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked. ‚ÄúNinety-one people die each day from gun violence in this country and the best Speaker Ryan can muster is a meaningless bill,‚Äù said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi aide Drew Hammill. Six people who said they lost family and loved ones to gun violence were arrested in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, after a protest demanding Congress reject the Ryan measure and vote on the Democratic measures.

Trump takes potential VP running mates for test drives,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump is taking some of his potential vice presidential running mates out for a test drive this week, meeting in private and trotting them out in public as he seeks to make his choice before the Republican National Convention less than two weeks away.  Republicans close to the campaign say Trump and his team are considering announcing his running mate pick next week ahead of the convention, to be held July 18-21 in Cleveland, to try to get maximum media buzz from the decision. As his aides vet the people on his short list, Trump is getting an up-close look at some of the candidates and talking about it publicly, dispensing with the usual tradition of keeping secret the process of choosing a running mate. Trump, who is to be formally nominated at the convention as the Republican candidate for the Nov. 8 election, met privately on Tuesday with one possible pick, U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, at Trump Tower in New York. On Tuesday night, the two appeared together at a Trump rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump introduced Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as ‚Äúa great friend of mine, somebody respected by everybody.‚Äù Then it was Corker‚Äôs turn.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve figured out the reason why you love him so much,‚Äù the senator told the crowd. ‚ÄúThe reason you love him so much is because he loves you. He loves you and he wants the best for you.‚Äù      On Wednesday, Trump is to be joined for an event in Cincinnati by Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives who is another possible pick by Trump for the No. 2 position. Gingrich has been a close Trump adviser and is well regarded at Trump Tower. On Monday, Trump met on Monday with U.S. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, another candidate on his short list. Others on Trump‚Äôs running mate list include Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who Trump met with on Saturday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin and U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Christie, a former Trump rival for the Republican nomination, and Sessions are among Trump‚Äôs earliest supporters in the party and closest advisers. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 "
Judge blocks Kansas' attempt to cut Planned Parenthood from Medicaid,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Kansas Governor Sam Brownback‚Äôs efforts to remove Planned Parenthood, a U.S. women‚Äôs healthcare and abortion provider, from a government health insurance program for the poor in the state. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson issued the 54-page order for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, ruling the state could not cancel Medicaid provider agreements with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, or PPKM, and Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, or PPSLR. ‚ÄúIt is uncontroverted that PPKM and PPSLR serve hundreds of underprivileged women in the State of Kansas,‚Äù Robinson said in the order. ‚ÄúIt is in the public interest to allow these individuals to be treated by the qualified provider of their choice, and to have that provider reimbursed under Medicaid pending a trial on the merits in this case.‚Äù The Republican governor ordered state officials to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and its affiliates through the state Medicaid program in January, saying the state would not fund an industry that disrespected life. A spokeswoman for Brownback said in a statement on Tuesday: ‚ÄúThe governor will continue the fight to make Kansas a pro-life state. We will review today‚Äôs preliminary ruling and move forward with the litigation.‚Äù The state sought to cut funding after the release of videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group that activists said showed that Planned Parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue. Neither of the Planned Parenthood affiliates involved in the case participates in fetal tissue donation or sale, court records show. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled with the judge‚Äôs ruling. We felt strongly that we were going into this on the right side of the law,‚Äù said Laura McQuade, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, formerly Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri. The two organizations, along with three of their patients who are on Medicaid, sued the state in May, arguing Brownback‚Äôs order would break federal law and violate the U.S. Constitution. Planned Parenthood has denied taking any illegal payments, calling the videos distortions of fetal-tissue donations. The organization has said it has received only reimbursements for its costs, which are legal under U.S. law. Planned Parenthood said in May that at least two dozen states had cut or tried to slash funding to its clinics since the mid-2015 release of the undercover videos. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 "
Clinton expands lead over Trump to 13 points: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton widened her lead over likely Republican nominee Donald Trump to 13 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. The July 1-5 poll included responses gathered mostly over the holiday weekend, before the Federal Bureau of Investigation recommended on Tuesday that no criminal charges be filed against Clinton over her use of private email servers and what it called her ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of classified information while she was U.S. secretary of state. The presumptive Democratic nominee led Trump, a New York businessman, by 9 percentage points in a previous Reuters/Ipsos poll that ran from June 27 to July 1. Tuesday‚Äôs poll showed that 46 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 33 percent backed Trump. Twenty-two percent said they would not support either candidate for the  Nov. 8 election.  Throughout the campaign, Clinton has been dogged by her use of a personal email server during her years as the nation‚Äôs top diplomat. Over the past several months, she has handed over thousands of pages of emails to investigators and responded to a number of government inquiries.  Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified documents on her private servers, yet the public appears distrustful of her, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. In early May, 63 percent of Americans, including 36 percent of Democrats, said they did not believe Clinton was ‚Äúhonest and truthful.‚Äù But Clinton has led Trump most of the year among likely voters. Since mid-May, she has maintained a relatively consistent level of support among likely voters, while Trump‚Äôs popularity has eroded as his campaign wrestled with a variety of issues.  Republican leaders distanced themselves from Trump after he suggested a federal judge was biased because of his Hispanic heritage and after he doubled down on a pledge to block Muslims from entering the country. On Tuesday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan criticized a tweet posted by Trump over the weekend that many deemed to be anti-Semitic. Trump‚Äôs level of support among likely voters was about 10 points below what 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney received in early July 2012. Among Clinton‚Äôs supporters, nearly half said they were backing her because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want Donald Trump to win.‚Äù A further 39 percent said they ‚Äúagree with her positions,‚Äù and about 13 percent said they ‚Äúlike her personally.‚Äù  The online national poll of 1,441 American adults had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

U.S. appeals court upholds conviction over shared password,"(Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday gave the U.S. Department of Justice broad leeway to police password theft under a 1984 anti-hacking law, upholding the conviction of a former Korn/Ferry International executive for stealing confidential client data. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said David Nosal violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 2005 when he and two friends, who had also left Korn/Ferry, used an employee‚Äôs password to access the recruiting firm‚Äôs computers and obtain information to help start a new firm. Writing for a 2-1 majority, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said Nosal acted ‚Äúwithout authorization‚Äù even though the employee, his former secretary, had voluntarily provided her password. The defendant had by then been working as an independent contractor for Korn/Ferry. Nosal and his friends had previously had their own log-in credentials revoked. Nosal‚Äôs case has been closely watched by digital privacy groups worried that it could make it easier to prosecute people for ordinary password sharing, such as when a husband logs into his wife‚Äôs Facebook account with her credentials and permission. ‚ÄúThe court is criminalizing conduct that ordinary Americans do every day online,‚Äù Jamie Williams, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which supported overturning Nosal‚Äôs conviction, said in an interview. Dennis Riordan, a lawyer for Nosal, said in a statement he will ask an 11-judge appeals court panel to review the decision. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. Nosal had been appealing his April 2013 jury conviction and one-year prison sentence for violating the CFAA and for trade secret theft under the Economic Espionage Act. The appeals court on Tuesday upheld Nosal‚Äôs conviction under the EEA. It also ordered a recalculation of his $827,983 of restitution to Korn/Ferry to reconsider the legal fee component. Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented. He said the majority‚Äôs reasoning could cover the sharing of passwords to devices such as smartphones, laptops and iPads, and transform ‚Äúmillions of people who engage in this ubiquitous, useful, and generally harmless conduct into unwitting federal criminals.‚Äù McKeown, however, said this approach ignored reality and could enable criminals to escape prosecution after they found obliging employees willing to ‚Äúwilly-nilly give out passwords.‚Äù The appeals court had in April 2012 dismissed other counts accusing Nosal of CFAA violations. The case is U.S. v. Nosal, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-10037. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 "
Factbox: FBI vs. Clinton - Seven points of contention,"(Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey undercut some of the main arguments Hillary Clinton has made in defense of her use of an unauthorized private email system while she was U.S. secretary of state.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating Clinton‚Äôs email system after government watchdogs found that some of her messages contained classified government secrets last year. Comey is recommending that Clinton not face criminal charges. But in an unusual step, he used a news conference to give a public rebuttal on Tuesday of the defenses offered by Clinton over the last year. Here are seven times that Comey contradicts Clinton: Clinton said: Clinton said in March 2015 that she returned ‚Äúanything that could be possibly viewed as work related.‚Äù She later swore under oath that she returned all her work emails to the State Department in 2014, some 30,000 in all. Comey said: The FBI recovered ‚Äúseveral thousand‚Äù work emails that were not returned to the State Department. Comey has ‚Äúreasonable confidence‚Äù that there was no deliberate effort to withhold these messages.   Clinton said: Clinton has repeatedly said she did not send or receive any classified information through her private email system, and that emails being released to the public that were now marked classified were being retroactively ‚Äúupgraded.‚Äù Comey said: The FBI found 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained information that was classified at the time the messages were sent. Eight of those chains contained Top Secret information, the highest level of government classification; another 36 chains contained Secret information, and eight contained confidential information. Clinton said: Clinton has repeatedly said she did not send or receive any emails that were ‚Äúmarked‚Äù classified. Comey said: A ‚Äúvery small number‚Äù of emails were marked as containing classified information. ‚ÄúBut even if information is not marked ‚Äòclassified‚Äô in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it,‚Äù Comey said. Clinton said:      The ‚Äúsecurity and integrity‚Äù of the email system were taken seriously, and ‚Äúrobust protections‚Äù were put in place, according to her staff in March 2015. Comey said: The system was ‚Äúnot even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at departments and agencies of the U.S. government, or even with a commercial service like Gmail.‚Äù Clinton said: Clinton said there is no evidence there was ever a breach of her email system. Comey said:  It would be unlikely to find ‚Äúdirect evidence‚Äù of Clinton‚Äôs email system being hacked, but the FBI believes ‚Äúit is possible that hostile actors gained access.‚Äù ‚ÄúHostile actors‚Äù also gained access to some people Clinton corresponded with on her email system. Clinton said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm certainly well aware of the classification requirements,‚Äù Clinton said in March 2015. Comey said: Clinton and her colleagues were ‚Äúextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.‚Äù Clinton said: Clinton has maintained that her email system was allowed and that she did nothing wrong. She has also said it was a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù and apologized for it. Comey said:  There is no evidence that Clinton and her colleagues intended to break the law, but people who engage in similar activity are ‚Äúoften subject to security or administrative sanctions.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 "
"Obama hits campaign trail, says ready to 'pass baton' to Clinton","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - After months on the sidelines, President Barack Obama joined Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail at a rally in North Carolina on Tuesday, telling voters he was ready to ‚Äúpass the baton‚Äù to his former secretary of state. Obama took the microphone in Charlotte, chanting ‚ÄúHillary!‚Äù and told the crowd there had never been a candidate as prepared to be president as Clinton, his rival in 2008 for the Democratic nomination. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve run my last campaign, and I couldn‚Äôt be prouder of the things we‚Äôve done together, but I‚Äôm ready to pass the baton,‚Äù Obama said, in what was likely to be the first of many trips this year on Clinton‚Äôs behalf. ‚ÄúI know Hillary Clinton is going to take it, and I know she can run that race,‚Äù he said. Obama was returning the favor after Clinton backed him in 2008‚Äôs general election. This year, he waited while she battled U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination before endorsing Clinton last month once she became the party‚Äôs presumptive nominee. In Charlotte, Clinton preceded Obama, saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to build on the vision for America that President Obama has always championed, a vision for a future where we do great things together.‚Äù The North Carolina trip came the same day that Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said the agency would not recommend that Clinton face criminal charges over her use of a personal email system while secretary of state. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama did not get advance notice of Comey‚Äôs announcement and said the president would not discuss the FBI‚Äôs investigation with Clinton. Clinton‚Äôs campaign welcomed the end of a probe that had cast a cloud over her campaign, but Republicans seized on Comey‚Äôs criticism of what he termed Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of emails.  Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who was due to campaign in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Tuesday, criticized FBI recommendation, tweeting, ‚ÄúAs usual, bad judgment.‚Äù  The first joint campaign appearance by Obama and Clinton was initially planned for soon after she clinched the Democratic nomination. But it was postponed following the mass shooting on June 12 at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. On Tuesday, Obama appeared at ease back on the campaign trail. He mocked Trump‚Äôs promise to ‚ÄúMake America Great Again,‚Äù saying, ‚ÄúAmerica is really great.‚Äù And he sought to contrast Clinton‚Äôs preparedness for the White House and passion for helping working families with Trump, a political neophyte he referred to at times as ‚Äúthe other guy.‚Äù ‚ÄúEverybody can tweet, but nobody actually knows what it takes to do the job until you‚Äôve sat behind the desk,‚Äù he said, an apparent reference to the wealthy New York businessman‚Äôs fondness for Twitter. Clinton hopes to reclaim North Carolina for the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election. Obama won the state in the 2008 general election but lost it narrowly in his 2012 re-election. Obama‚Äôs appearance with the former first lady closes a circle on a relationship that began cordially when the two were U.S. Senate colleagues, grew tense when they were presidential rivals in 2008, and became close when Clinton served in Obama‚Äôs Cabinet during his first term. Clinton and her family have played a role in Obama‚Äôs elections. Clinton and Obama appeared together in Unity, New Hampshire, following their divisive primary fight in 2008, and Clinton‚Äôs husband, former President Bill Clinton, gave a well-received speech at the 2012 Democratic convention. Obama has focused on what he touts as Clinton‚Äôs strength of character, in hopes of shoring up support among voters who find her untrustworthy, a weakness Trump has sought to exploit. Clinton needs Obama to woo young and left-leaning voters who backed Sanders and who made up part of the president‚Äôs voting coalition in 2008 and 2012. Clinton has also campaigned with high-profile liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, and she will appear later this week with Vice President Joe Biden. Clinton and Obama traveled to North Carolina on the presidential plane Air Force One, which Trump characterized as a burden on taxpayers. A Clinton spokesman said the campaign would cover its portion of the travel costs. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 "
U.S. legislators to call for release of Americans held by Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A resolution calling for Iran to release two U.S. citizens imprisoned there for months will be introduced on Wednesday by House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce, a Republican, and Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly, their offices said. The resolution will call for Iran to immediately and unconditionally release businessman Siamak Namazi and his father, Baquer Namazi, 80, both of whom have dual citizenship. The text of the resolution was seen by Reuters. It will also call for U.S. President Barack Obama to undertake efforts to secure their release.  Siamak Namazi was detained by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in October while visiting relatives and has been barred from leaving Iran since July 2015. His father was arrested in Tehran in February. ‚ÄúIran‚Äôs continued wrongful jailing of Americans is very disturbing,‚Äù Royce said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.¬†‚ÄúSiamak and Baquer Namazi deserve to be free and with their families, and this resolution should push President Obama to step up efforts to bring them home.‚Äù The resolution ‚Äúencourages the President to utilize appropriate measures‚Äù against Iran‚Äôs government if the Namazis are not released, but it stops short of calling for economic sanctions, a specific request by a representative of the Namazi family, said one source familiar with the resolution who declined to be named. Siamak Namazi has criticized sanctions against Iran, writing in a 2013 opinion piece in the New York Times that Western sanctions had blocked medicines from reaching the country.  U.S. State Department spokesman Sam Werberg said the agency does not comment on resolutions before they have been formally introduced. He added, ‚ÄúWe are not aware of any charges against either Siamak or Baquer and we believe that both reported detentions are unjust.‚Äù  Five American citizens were released from Iranian prisons in January as part of a prisoner swap with the United States.  Iran has detained several other dual nationals since that swap, including Homa Hoodfar, a Canadian-Iranian woman, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman and project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, and Nazak Afshar, a French-Iranian woman.

Ryan slams Trump 'star' tweet,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday sharply criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs Twitter post depicting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton against a backdrop of cash and a Star of David, saying anti-Semitic images have ‚Äúno place in a presidential campaign.‚Äù ‚ÄúCandidates should know that,‚Äù Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican, said in an interview with radio station WTMJ in Milwaukee, two days before Trump was due to meet House and Senate Republicans in Washington. ‚ÄúI really believe he‚Äôs got to clean up the way his new media works,‚Äù he said, in a reference to Trump‚Äôs social media efforts. The presumptive Republican nominee has frequently used Twitter to skewer his opponents and push his proposals. The radio station posted audio from the interview on its website, and the Wisconsin congressman‚Äôs office provided a transcript of the session. Ryan‚Äôs comments came a day after Trump defended the tweet, saying he had not meant the six-pointed star to refer to the Star of David, which is a symbol of Judaism. Rather, he said, the star could have referred to a sheriff‚Äôs badge, which is shaped similarly except for small circles at the ends of each of its six points, or a ‚Äúplain star.‚Äù Republican leaders were criticized in the U.S. media for not speaking out forcefully against the image attacking Clinton, which appeared over the U.S. Independence Day holiday weekend. ‚ÄúIf I had to stop everything and comment to a ridiculous tweet sent out by this (Trump) campaign, I‚Äôd have no time for anything else,‚Äù said Ryan, who supports Trump but has repeatedly spoken out against Trump‚Äôs rhetoric, including his criticism of a Mexican-American judge. ‚ÄúMy understanding is, this was done by staff not by he himself,‚Äù Ryan said. ‚ÄúBut more importantly, they‚Äôve got clean this thing up.‚Äù Trump is due to meet with House and Senate Republicans in Washington on Thursday. Ryan did not say whether the tweet was likely to come up.  House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that the meeting would mainly focus on the newly released Republican agenda, which addresses six types of issue from poverty to tax reform. ‚ÄúBut members will be free to talk about all different angles, and ideas, and probably some people will give their opinions and ideas on how to run the campaign,‚Äù McCarthy said.

"FBI to recommend no charges in Clinton email probe, director says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI will recommend to the Justice Department that no charges be filed over Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server while secretary of state, agency Director James Comey said on Tuesday, lifting a cloud of uncertainty looming over her White House campaign. The agency found evidence of ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of emails by Clinton, and that at least 110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent, said Comey, announcing the result of a yearlong investigation. But the FBI concluded that ‚Äúno reasonable prosecutor‚Äù would bring charges against Clinton, he said. ‚ÄúAlthough the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,‚Äù Comey told reporters in Washington. His recommendation will likely stand. The country‚Äôs top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, said on Friday she will accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI director on whether to charge Clinton for mishandling emails.  The FBI probe has dogged the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee‚Äôs campaign for the past year and has contributed to her low poll ratings on honesty and trustworthiness. Republicans pointed to the controversy as evidence that Clinton considered herself above the law. Donald Trump, Clinton‚Äôs Republican rival for the Nov. 8 election, has hammered her on the issue, saying the investigation should disqualify Clinton from being president. On Tuesday, he said the FBI decision was unfair. ‚ÄúThe system is rigged,‚Äù he said on Twitter. ‚ÄúAs usual, bad judgment.‚Äù The FBI has been investigating whether Clinton broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One of the questions is whether she mishandled classified information on the server. Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information on her private server. She had a  voluntary 3-1/2-hour interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Saturday in Washington. Comey said, however, there was ‚Äúevidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.‚Äù  But he said the FBI did not find that Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate the law, and there was no ‚Äúintentional misconduct‚Äù by her lawyers who sorted her emails. He said her staff should have known the server was in an improper place for her emails. Comey also said there was no evidence that anyone had hacked Clinton‚Äôs communications, although it was possible. Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. Republican criticism increased after Clinton‚Äôs husband, former President Bill Clinton, met privately with Lynch last week. Lynch later said she regretted the meeting and the two did not discuss the investigation. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 "

"Clinton snags AFL-CIO official, former Sanders staffer, in labor outreach","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has hired two people with close ties to U.S. organized labor to try to lock down support from union members as Republican candidate Donald Trump makes courting working-class voters central to his campaign.¬† ¬†¬†¬† The two new staffers, Lori D‚ÄôOrazio and Michele Gilliam, are to be deputy labor campaign directors, according to a campaign aide. D‚ÄôOrazio is moving to the campaign from the biggest U.S. labor federation, the AFL-CIO.

But she will need to harness the on-the-ground manpower of unions in crucial battleground states ahead of November‚Äôs general election match-up with the populist presumptive Republican nominee, Trump. The aide said the campaign is counting on D‚ÄôOrazio and Gilliam to do just that. Although organized labor is a traditionally Democratic constituency, Trump has made a play to win over rank-and-file union members by criticizing international trade deals such as the pending Trans Pacific Partnership, which labor opposes.¬†Even so, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka warned last month when the federation endorsed Clinton that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for U.S. workers and vowed to mobilize the group‚Äôs resources to defeat him.¬† The AFL-CIO is the largest U.S. federation of labor unions that collectively represent more than 12 million workers.¬†Before joining the AFL-CIO, D‚ÄôOrazio worked for another large U.S. union, the United Auto Workers, and Gilliam once served as an organizer for a local chapter of the Transport Workers Union.

Trump defends 'star' tweet; Clinton says it's anti-Semitic,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday defended a social media post he made two days earlier that included an image depicting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton against a backdrop of cash and a Star of David, while Clinton called the image anti-Semitic.

Reuters confirmed the image was posted there on June 22 by viewing a link to an archived version of a /pol/ page, although the page has since been updated and the image removed. ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs use of a blatantly anti-Semitic image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough, but the fact that it‚Äôs a part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern,‚Äù Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in a statement emailed to reporters on Monday.  The Nazis forced Jews to wear a Star of David on their clothing to identify themselves during the Holocaust. Trump posted and deleted the tweet on Saturday, then tweeted a similar image in which the star was replaced by a circle. On Monday, he lashed out at journalists for continuing to report on the original tweet. ‚ÄúDishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff‚Äôs Star, or plain star!‚Äù Trump wrote on Twitter. Saturday‚Äôs incident was the latest departure by Trump from a recent effort to appease Republicans worried about his brash public persona by trying to appear more restrained. The Republican convention, where Trump is expected to be named the party‚Äôs nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, is two weeks away. In June, Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and began using a teleprompter to make speeches, hoping to show his campaign could be more inclusive after he aroused controversy by referring to some Mexicans crossing the U.S. border illegally as ‚Äúrapists,‚Äù and his mocking of a disabled reporter, which Clinton has begun using in attack ads against him. Ed Brookover, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in an interview on CNN on Monday that the campaign felt it had ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù the issue about the star by deleting Trump‚Äôs original tweet.  Brookover said the image‚Äôs earlier appearance on the neo-Nazi forum was irrelevant.  ‚ÄúThese images get posted and reposted and reposted on social media on many forums,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere was never any intention of anti-Semitism.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 4, 2016 "
Trump meets Senator Ernst amid vice presidential speculation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump met with U.S. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa on Monday, feeding speculation she could be on the short list for consideration as his vice presidential running mate, Fox News reported. Ernst told the network that she and the New York real estate mogul had a ‚Äúgood conversation.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will continue to share my insights with Donald about the need to strengthen our economy, keep our nation safe, and ensure America is always a strong, stabilizing force around the globe,‚Äù she said. Trump had tweeted that he would meet Ernst in New Jersey. ‚ÄúShe has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!‚Äù he said. Trump met with Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also mentioned as a potential running mate, and his wife on Saturday. Republican sources have told Reuters that former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie top Trump‚Äôs vice presidential short list. Other names to watch included U.S. Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, the sources said. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 "
U.S. senators warn against further troop cuts in Afghanistan,"KABUL (Reuters) - The international military mission in Afghanistan will fail if troop levels are reduced further, with potentially dangerous repercussions for the rest of the world, a delegation of U.S. lawmakers warned during a visit to Kabul on Monday. Fifteen years after an American-led operation toppled the Taliban in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Barack Obama is considering whether to maintain the current level of 9,800 U.S. troops or reduce it to 5,500 by the end of the year, as current plans call for. ‚ÄúI cannot guarantee success if we keep 9,800, but I can ensure you failure if we go to 5,500,‚Äù Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters in Kabul. ‚ÄúI will have a hard time supporting our continued presence here as it‚Äôs not fair to those left behind... They just can‚Äôt do the job. If we go to 5,500 this place will fall apart, quickly.‚Äù Graham joined U.S. senators John McCain, Benjamin Sasse, and Joe Donnelly in a visit timed so the bipartisan delegation could visit with troops during the Independence Day holiday. The Obama administration should decide on troop levels ‚Äúsooner rather than later,‚Äù McCain said, arguing that reducing the number of troops could lead to a repeat of the disaster in Iraq, where Islamic State militants seized major cities and wide swathes of territory. McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sharply criticized the White House‚Äôs decision last year to restrict U.S. forces from targeting Taliban fighters except in self-defense and other limited circumstances. Those rules were recently relaxed on the recommendation of American commanders in Kabul, but McCain said it was ‚Äúalmost criminal‚Äù that the restrictions were in place for more than a year. ‚ÄúThe rules of engagement were so restrictive that it gave an advantage to the Taliban and other terrorist groups,‚Äù the senator said. The lawmakers highlighted Afghanistan‚Äôs history as one of the original havens for al Qaeda terrorists and pleaded for more patience. ‚ÄúUltimately we‚Äôre going to win this fight, it‚Äôs just going to take decades,‚Äù Sasse said. ‚ÄúThe American people well understand that staying partnered with a good ally like the Afghan government is the best way to deny future safe havens to those who would plot jihadi attacks across the globe.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 4, 2016 "
Top lawmakers confident in fairness of Clinton email probe,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top lawmakers from both major U.S. political parties said on Sunday they trusted the Justice Department to appropriately handle its probe of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server, after a heavily criticized meeting between Clinton‚Äôs husband and the U.S. attorney general. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said on CBS show ‚ÄúFace the Nation‚Äù that they would respect Attorney General Loretta Lynch‚Äôs decision on whether to prosecute Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.  Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also said he respected the process, though he acknowledged Lynch‚Äôs private meeting last week at an airport with former President Bill Clinton was unfortunate. ‚ÄúI think both of them wish their airplanes had never come anywhere near each other,‚Äù Schiff said on ‚ÄúFace the Nation,‚Äù adding that he still had confidence in the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to do a thorough investigation of Clinton‚Äôs email use. ‚ÄúIf they say they are going to conduct this investigation by the book, I believe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù said Schiff, who supports Clinton for the party‚Äôs nomination. Lynch said on Friday that she would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute Clinton. The lawmakers‚Äô endorsement for the process follows Clinton‚Äôs meeting Saturday with investigators at the FBI‚Äôs Washington headquarters, where she answered questions for three and a half hours as part of the probe into use of her private email server. The FBI is investigating Clinton‚Äôs email use and whether laws were broken as a result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Lawmakers and political strategists speculated on Sunday that the FBI‚Äôs interview of Clinton signaled its investigation could be nearing its end. But the FBI offered no information about the status of the probe or who its targets may be. Clinton has long insisted she is not a target. Clinton herself said in comments to MSNBC on Saturday that she ‚Äúwas pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion.‚Äù Her rival, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, said it was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against her. The two have already begun an acrimonious battle ahead of the presidential election on Nov. 8. Democrats are hoping the issue will be resolved before their four-day convention in Philadelphia that begins July 25, which is expected to culminate with Clinton‚Äôs nomination for the presidential race. It is unclear what Democrats would do if Clinton were to be indicted and if any contingency plan exists.   Not all lawmakers said they were confident the Justice Department could maintain impartiality. Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, said on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù on Sunday he thought Lynch‚Äôs meeting with Bill Clinton ‚Äúraises questions about political interference in this investigation.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 3, 2016 "
"Senator McCain, visiting Pakistan, seeks better ties in Islamist fight","ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said on Sunday he would like relations between United States and Pakistan to improve as they have a common enemy in the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups. Relations between Pakistan and United States have been frayed over the past decade, with U.S. officials frustrated by what they term Islamabad‚Äôs unwillingness to act against Islamist groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. Pakistan rejects harboring militants but says there are limits to how much it can do as it is already fighting multiple Islamist groups and is wary of ‚Äúblowback‚Äù in the form of more terror attacks on its soil.  McCain, visiting Pakistan as part of a U.S. delegation, said he had an ‚Äúexcellent meeting‚Äù with Pakistani foreign ministry officials. ‚ÄúWe come back with a message that we have a common enemy in ISIS, radical Islam and terrorism, and we look forward to closer relations and resolving the differences we have,‚Äù McCain told Pakistan‚Äôs national PTV channel. Relations between United States and Pakistan were tested again in May by a U.S. drone strike that killed Afghan Taliban chief Mullah Akhtar Mansour on Pakistani soil.  As part of the visit, McCain traveled to Miranshah, the capital of the restive North Waziristan region bordering Afghanistan. The region was effectively run Islamists by groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Haqqani network until the Pakistani military launched operations against them in 2014. ‚ÄúI was very impressed with the progress (on the ground),‚Äù said McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ‚ÄúI see us working together in confronting a common challenge ‚Äì radical Islamic terrorism ‚Äì and these kinds of meetings are very helpful to both those countries,‚Äù McCain added. The Islamic State has struggled to gain a major foothold in Pakistan, analysts say, but officials worry the group may pose a threat in the future.  Pakistan said the country‚Äôs top foreign policy official Sartaj Aziz had briefed the U.S. delegation - which includes Senators Lindsey Graham, Benjamin Sasse and Joe Donnelly - about faltering peace talks to end the civil war in Afghanistan. So far China, United States and Pakistan have struggled to persuade the Afghan Taliban to meaningfully embrace the talks. ‚ÄúNo country had as much vital stakes in the success of these joint efforts, as Pakistan, (Aziz) remarked,‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs foreign ministry said in a statement.

Californians seek pot of gold in marijuana legalization,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. - There is no guarantee California will vote to legalize recreational marijuana in November, but political operative and father of four Daniel Conway has already staked his future on it. Conway left his job as chief of staff to Sacramento‚Äôs celebrity mayor, former Phoenix Suns NBA basketball star Kevin Johnson, to help start the marijuana investment company Truth Enterprises. He is one of hundreds in the most populous U.S. state already pushing ahead with plans to enter a market experts say will be worth $4 billion by 2020. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm someone of an age and of a demographic that sees the legalization and normalization of marijuana as inevitable,‚Äù said Conway, 35. ‚ÄúThis was a chance not just to build companies but to build an industry.‚Äù With a population of nearly 40 million people, and a thriving medical marijuana trade legalized 20 years ago, California already has the United States‚Äô largest legal marijuana market. Legalization of recreational pot would generate an estimated $1 billion in additional taxes per year. If voters in November approve a measure to legalize and tax marijuana that qualified last Tuesday for the ballot, California would be the fifth U.S. state - and by far the largest - to allow marijuana for recreational use, joining Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, as well as the District of Columbia. A similar ballot initiative failed in California in 2010, but recent polls show strong support for legalization. The latest effort is backed by mainstream leaders including Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who helped negotiate the regulations and taxes it would impose. Eight other states, including Nevada and Maine, also have recreational or medical marijuana proposals headed for their 2016 ballots. California‚Äôs sheer size as the world‚Äôs 6th largest economy means a decision by its voters to legalize marijuana could accelerate the trend elsewhere. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe there will be any precedent in the United States that can compare to it except for maybe the Gold Rush,‚Äù said Leslie Bocskor, whose Nevada-based private equity firm, Electrum Partners, advises and invests in marijuana-related businesses. The lure of wealth in an uncharted industry is so great that thousands of people are jostling for position, said Bocskor. Since January, 115 new California companies have joined the National Cannabis Industry Association, bringing total membership in the state to 330, said Deputy Director Taylor West. New companies include cultivators, dispensaries, laboratories, law partnerships, accountants, software developers, insurers and more, she said. Their challenge is to set up an infrastructure for a business that is not yet legal. Conway and his business partner, General Hydroponics CEO Ross Haley, for example, recently purchased farmland in Northern California that they hope to use to grow marijuana but would not say where before the measure is passed. Newport Beach-based Terra Tech is trying to prepare for recreational sales while building a legal business within the state‚Äôs medical marijuana marketplace, which has annual sales of $2.7 billion. The company spent more than $800,000 designing and remodeling its Oakland dispensary to look more like a high-end lounge than a drab medical clinic, said CEO Derek Peterson. It also developed colorful packaging for its marijuana instead of dispensing it in prescription bottles. Despite such optimism, passage of the California measure is not certain. It is opposed by many of the same law enforcement and health care groups who helped defeat the 2010 initiative. But this time backers have the deep pockets of former Facebook president Sean Parker, support from Newsom - a Democrat expected to run for governor in 2018 - and a switch in attitude among voters who saw legalization come on line in other states. The measure would allow adults age 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, cultivate up to six plants and sets rules for commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale. It includes rules aimed at keeping cannabis products from children, preventing impaired driving and requiring licenses for sellers. Newsom said he is backing it as a way to responsibly manage legalization, which he views as inevitable but necessary to handle carefully. ‚ÄúAs a guy with four kids, who doesn‚Äôt like the drug, doesn‚Äôt like the smell, doesn‚Äôt want my kids to think it‚Äôs normalized, this is my number one concern,‚Äù Newsom said.",politicsNews,"July 3, 2016 "
FBI interviews Hillary Clinton in private server probe,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for three and a half hours on Saturday as part of the probe into her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, her campaign said. The interview at FBI headquarters in Washington followed a week of intense public focus on the investigation and on  Clinton‚Äôs viability as a presidential candidate, with four months to go to the election. Her campaign has tried for months to downplay the controversy as a distraction.   In an interview broadcast on MSNBC, Clinton said she was happy to do the FBI interview, which her spokesman earlier described as ‚Äúvoluntary.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been answering questions for over a year‚Äù regarding the private email server, Clinton said. It was not clear if the questioning of Clinton signaled an imminent conclusion to the investigation in a pivotal time for the presidential race. It does follow FBI interviews of several of Clinton‚Äôs former staff members, as well as her top aide Huma Abedin.  Clinton is expected to be formally nominated as the Democratic candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election at the party‚Äôs convention in less than four weeks.  ‚ÄúTiming of FBI interview, between primaries and convention, probably good timing for @HillaryClinton,‚Äù tweeted David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama who served as the chief strategist for his two presidential campaigns. ‚ÄúBest to get it behind her.‚Äù Clinton is currently the front-runner for the White House with polls showing her leading presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said it was ‚Äúimpossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong!‚Äù   He also criticized Clinton‚Äôs husband, former President Bill Clinton, for meeting privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier this week, which Lynch later said she regretted, though she said they did not discuss the investigation.  ‚ÄúWhat Bill did was stupid!‚Äù Trump tweeted. The FBI is investigating whether anyone in Clinton‚Äôs operation broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One of the questions is whether they mishandled classified information on the server.   Clinton and her staff have struggled to respond to accusations that her use of the server in violation of State Department protocol means she is untrustworthy. Trump has said the investigation should disqualify her from being president. ‚Äú@HillaryClinton campaign statement says She ‚Äúvoluntarily‚Äù met w @FBI for 3.5 hours this morning - yeah, lots of people volunteer 2 do that,‚Äù tweeted the Republican National Committee‚Äôs communications director, Sean Spicer. FBI Director James Comey said in testimony to Congress in March he felt pressure to complete the investigation quickly. Adding to the uncertainty over Clinton is the FBI‚Äôs refusal to say who is the target of its investigation. Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. Republicans, including Trump, intensified their criticism of the process on Thursday after news emerged of Lynch‚Äôs meeting with Bill Clinton.  Lynch said she would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute Clinton. The FBI probe and the partisan fight over the server have added an extra layer of uncertainty to one of the most tumultuous presidential races in recent memory. Trump, a political novice once dismissed by the Republican establishment, will likely emerge this month as the party‚Äôs nominee and has set his sights on Clinton, who he has labeled ‚ÄúCrooked Hillary.‚Äù  Clinton held a nine-point lead over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.

Trump tweet attacking Clinton employs image of Jewish star,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday tweeted an image of rival Hillary Clinton alongside hundred-dollar bills and a Jewish star bearing the words ‚Äúmost corrupt candidate ever!‚Äù, prompting outrage and bafflement on social media.   Two hours after his initial tweet, Trump tweeted a similar image in which the six-pointed Star of David - which appears on Israel‚Äôs flag and which Jews were forced to wear on their clothing by the Nazis during the Holocaust - was replaced by a circle. The original tweet was deleted. Critics said the image featuring the star harkened back to centuries-old anti-Semitic stereotypes, such as the belief that Jews are greedy. ‚ÄúJust saw #DonaldTrump‚Äôs Star of David tweet. I‚Äôm impressed by his ability to find a way to insult literally every kind of human being,‚Äù screenwriter Cole Haddon wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúA Star of David, a pile of cash, and suggestions of corruption. Donald Trump again plays to the white supremacists,‚Äù wrote Erick Erickson, a conservative radio host who has been critical of Trump. The tweets originated from Trump‚Äôs account, @realDonaldTrump, and no other users were mentioned in them. It was not clear whether someone inside Trump‚Äôs campaign made the image or whether he found it somewhere else. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, did not respond to a request for comment. The presumptive Republican nominee has been trying to assuage fears within his own party that he is alienating potential voters with offensive statements about Muslims, Latinos and women. Last month, Trump fired his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and began delivering speeches using a teleprompter, an abrupt change in style that was seen as an attempt to appear more presidential ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Saturday‚Äôs tweet was a reminder of the unrestrained side of Trump. The candidate has mocked a disabled newspaper reporter, referred to undocumented immigrants from Mexico as ‚Äúrapists‚Äù and recently pointed to a black man in the crowd at one of his rallies and called him ‚Äúmy African-American.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 2, 2016 "
North Carolina lawmakers adjourn after leaving transgender law largely unchanged,"(Reuters) - North Carolina lawmakers adjourned for the year on Friday night after leaving mostly intact a law restricting transgender bathroom access that has drawn condemnation and jeopardized the state‚Äôs efforts to host the NBA All-Star Game, officials said. The law passed in March made North Carolina the first U.S. state to require transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings and schools that match the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. The National Basketball Association has said it could move its All-Star Game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, and has cited concerns over the law‚Äôs effects on principles of inclusion and equal protection that league officials say they uphold.   A spokesman for the NBA could not immediately be reached for comment. North Carolina state Representative Chris Sgro, a Democrat who opposes the law, which is known as House Bill 2, said he had hoped lawmakers would vote on Friday on whether to repeal it. But they adjourned for the year without holding that vote, he said. ‚ÄúIt probably means that we‚Äôre going to have to come back for a special session because we‚Äôre going to lose the All-Star Game if we don‚Äôt,‚Äù Sgro, who is executive director of the gay rights group Equality North Carolina, said in a phone interview. The NBA All-Star Game is scheduled for February 2017. President Barack Obama, business leaders, entertainers and some prominent politicians have criticized House Bill 2, saying it is unfair to transgender people. State lawmakers on Friday addressed one point of controversy over House Bill 2 by restoring the right to sue for wrongful termination in state court on allegations of discrimination based on age, sex, race or other factors, officials said.  House Bill 2 had removed that right and required such suits to be filed in federal court. The office of Senate Leader Phil Berger, a Republican, said in a statement the change addressed concerns from the state‚Äôs governor and others.  But Berger expressed continued support for House Bill 2.    ‚ÄúProtecting the safety and privacy of North Carolina families by keeping grown men out of bathrooms, shower facilities and changing rooms with women and young girls has always been our primary objective,‚Äù Berger said in a statement.  On Thursday, an NBA statement said no final decision had yet been made regarding the All-Star Game. ",politicsNews,"July 2, 2016 "
"Gingrich, Christie lead Trump list of vice presidential options","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie top Donald Trump‚Äôs short list to be his vice presidential running mate, sources said, but the candidate is casting a wide net that also includes several U.S. senators and other governors. With less than three weeks to go until his formal nomination at the Republican National Convention as the party‚Äôs candidate in the Nov. 8 election, Trump‚Äôs search for a No. 2 has intensified. The wealthy businessman, a political neophyte, has said he wants a political veteran to help him navigate the power corridors of Washington.Gingrich and Christie, both loyal to Trump at a time when many Republican colleagues want nothing to do with him, would meet his requirement for experience - but would come with minuses as well as pluses. Other names to watch include U.S. Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Governors Mike Pence of Indiana and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Republicans close to the campaign said this week.     Trump has set up a meeting with Pence this weekend, a spokesman for the governor said on Friday. The New Yorker has also met with Corker and Fallin. ‚ÄúMr. Trump is meeting with a number of Republican leaders in the run-up to the convention in Cleveland, and he has a good relationship with Gov. Pence,‚Äù Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in an email response to a question from Reuters. An experienced running mate also could help with fundraising. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, raised more than $40 million for her campaign in June and about $28 million for her party. Trump, who largely self-funded his primary run, has not yet released June fundraising numbers.  Trump is expected to name his running mate close to the July 18-21 convention.  Gingrich, who was speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s and ran for president in 2012, is a popular conservative writer and speaker, and has been an important behind-the-scenes voice in urging Trump to adopt a more presidential demeanor. But because Trump is 70 and Gingrich is 73, they could face difficulty appealing to a younger generation. Christie quickly endorsed Trump after quitting the race early this year. A source said the 53-year-old governor has emerged as a key adviser to Trump and his campaign team. A source said Christie was instrumental in coaxing Trump to be less confrontational with a Mexican-American federal judge overseeing a fraud case involving Trump. One clue to Christie‚Äôs rising importance came earlier this week when some campaign supporters held a conference call to discuss strategy and talking points for media appearances. A source said that during the call Christie‚Äôs name was raised as someone who might comment on former President Bill Clinton‚Äôs meeting earlier this week with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. As a former federal prosecutor, Christie would be a credible voice.  Monday night‚Äôs private meeting of Clinton and Lynch, the top U.S. law enforcement officer, has been criticized because Hillary Clinton is under federal investigation for using a private email server when she was Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs secretary of state. The source said campaign associates made clear Christie was not to be used for this purpose. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre saving him for the general election,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to overexpose him.‚Äù Still, many Republicans are waiting to see whether Christie is named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a 2014 case involving charges that lanes on the George Washington Bridge were closed in New Jersey for political reasons. Corker, 63, offers Trump deep foreign policy experience as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, like Trump, believes the Republican Party needs shaking up. His stock may have gone down, however, because he has not hesitated to criticize the candidate at times. Ernst, a first-term senator and military veteran, could help improve Trump‚Äôs standing with women. She tacitly supported rival Marco Rubio during the Republican nominating campaign, though she has promised to support the party‚Äôs nominee. Ernst, who turned 46 on Friday, said earlier this month that the Trump campaign had not contacted her. The same goes for Oklahoma‚Äôs Fallin, who was among several Republican governors who met jointly with Trump in June. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honor to be mentioned for the office of vice president. I have not had any conversation with Mr. Trump about the vice presidency,‚Äù Fallin, 61, said in a statement. Some Republicans could be considered even if they have not had recent contact with the campaign. Alice Stewart, a former spokeswoman for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz‚Äôs presidential campaign, said the Texan‚Äôs running mate, Carly Fiorina, was only told late in the vetting that she might be picked. Trump‚Äôs vetting is being conducted by Washington lawyer A.B. Culvahouse, a longtime fixture in national Republican politics. ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2016 "
U.S. House Republican gun bill draws the ire of Democrats,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday introduced a measure intended to prevent gun sales to people on government watch lists, only to draw demands from Democrats for stronger proposals and a warning of possible new protests. A week after Democrats ended a 25-hour sit-in on the House floor to call for gun legislation after the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said lawmakers will vote next week on a measure giving government authorities three days to convince a judge that someone on a terrorism watch list should not be allowed to obtain a firearm. ‚ÄúIt is a responsible measure that confronts this threat while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens,‚Äù House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. But in a Friday conference call, House Democrats reached ‚Äúa clear consensus‚Äù to oppose the measure, calling it the handiwork of the National Rifle Association, an aide said. Similar legislation, backed by the NRA, was blocked by Democrats in the Senate last week.  Democrats also called for two amendments: one to allow the U.S. attorney general to decide without court approval whether someone on a watch list could buy a gun and another to expand existing background checks to all commercial gun sales including those at guns shows. Democratic Representatives John Lewis of Georgia and John Larson of Connecticut, who led last week‚Äôs sit-in, asked for a meeting with Ryan to request votes on the amendments, which consist of legislation originally sponsored by Republican Peter King of New York. Ryan agreed to meet with the Democrats next Tuesday, Republican and Democratic aides said. ‚ÄúIf these amendments are not allowed, then members will have further discussions about possible actions to take in response to this refusal to allow a vote on commonsense gun legislation,‚Äù said another House Democratic aide. AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said the House speaker ‚Äúlooks forward to meeting with Congressmen Lewis and Larson to discuss the important action the House will take to prevent terrorist attacks.‚Äù The new Republican proposal, which would apply to anyone who has been suspected of violent extremism within the past five years, would require authorities to show probable cause that a would-be buyer ‚Äúwill commit an act of terrorism‚Äù or violates existing prohibitions on undocumented immigrants, fugitives, convicts and people with mental illness. The gun provisions were tucked into a bill aimed at stepping up efforts against terrorism, including what the legislation referred to as ‚Äúradical Islamist terrorism.‚Äù Some Republicans have criticized Democrats for avoiding such terms to describe events like the Orlando shooting, where a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State killed 49 people last month. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said recently that President Barack Obama should resign for not having used ‚Äúradical Islam‚Äù in a statement responding to the Orlando massacre, in which police identified the shooter as a U.S. citizen born in New York to Afghan immigrants. The NRA said it was reviewing the legislation, while the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said the legislation proposed by House Republicans was a publicity stunt.

"Chicago police, lawmakers seek harsher sentences for gun offenders","CHICAGO (Reuters) - With murders and shootings soaring in Chicago this year, the city‚Äôs police chief and state lawmakers announced on Friday they will push for new laws setting harsher sentences for repeat offenders of gun crimes in Illinois. The law, which would be known as the Violent Gun Offenders Sentencing Act, is in its infant stages and would provide presumptive guidelines that judges would have to follow when ordering repeat criminals to serve jail time. Judges would be required to implement penalties on the higher range of existing sentencing laws. ‚ÄúPart of the goal is to incapacitate, get these violent offenders off the street,‚Äù state Senator Kwame Raoul said at a news conference announcing the proposed legislation. Raoul said he would sponsor the legislation along with Senator Antonio Mu√±oz and Representative Michael Zalewski, all Democrats.  Chicago, the third-largest U.S. city, has had 307 murders so far this year, up 50 percent from the same period last year, and 1,548 shootings, up 52 percent from the same period last year, according to police statistics. Police have blamed the violence largely on gangs and a proliferation of stolen guns. There were nearly 500 homicides last year, and gun violence is up in 2016, police say. More than 50 people involved in shootings and murders in Chicago this year would have been in prison at the time of the incident if the proposed tougher sentencing policies were in place, the police department said in a statement on Friday. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the law is not designed to penalize responsible gun owners, but focus on the individuals ‚Äúwho tell us ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care.‚Äô‚Äù Legislators in the state capital, Springfield, have frequently rejected gun control measures proposed by lawmakers from Chicago. A proposal made in 2013 by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to impose tougher sanctions for illegal gun possession did not get through the state Assembly because of opposition from black lawmakers who said it could lead to higher incarceration rates for blacks in Chicago communities already struggling with high numbers of former inmates who cannot find jobs.

"New Jersey Governor Christie halts road, bridge projects","(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ordered a halt to non-essential road, bridge and mass transit projects late Thursday after lawmakers failed to reauthorize the state fund that pays for them. Christie‚Äôs executive order calls for the state Department of Transportation and New Jersey Transit to devise a plan before midnight Saturday for the ‚Äúorderly‚Äù shutdown of projects funded by the Transportation Trust Fund. Federally funded projects will continue, Christie said in his executive order.  The state expects to receive an estimated $906 million of federal transportation aid, according to the state treasurer‚Äôs annual report. New Jersey‚Äôs ability to borrow for new transportation projects ran out on Friday, the start of the new fiscal year. The trust fund already has about $16 billion of outstanding debt for existing road projects. The fund has roughly $80 million left, said Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman John Wisniewski, who called Christie‚Äôs executive order ‚Äúpure theater.‚Äù         Without new appropriations or bond proceeds, the authority cannot pay vendors for construction. Projects at any stage - procurement, design and construction - are affected by Christie‚Äôs order, the Department of Transportation said. About a month ago, lawmakers discussed issuing grant anticipation revenue bonds, or so-called GARVEEs, as a stop-gap measure, but the idea was never acted upon, Wisniewski told Reuters. The flow of federal money backing those bonds is often uncertain from year to year. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do an annual capital program on GARVEE bonds,‚Äù he said. Christie ordered the remaining money in the fund to be held only for the most essential projects ‚Äúin order to protect the health, safety and welfare‚Äù of New Jerseyans, he said. Christie had hatched a late-night deal earlier this week with the Assembly to raise the state gasoline tax by 23 cents to 37.5 cents per gallon to replenish the fund. In exchange, the sales tax rate would shrink 1 percentage point to 6 percent, which could lead to an annual $1.7 billion shortfall in future budgets. But the Senate ended its session on Thursday without replenishing the program, which is expected to run out of money in August.  Senators were pushing their own bill, which would have phased out the estate tax on wealthy residents instead of reducing sales taxes. Christie also stripped several items out of the legislature‚Äôs budget on Thursday, signing a reduced $34.5 billion budget for fiscal 2017 that is just 2.1 percent higher than that for fiscal 2016.

"California tightens gun control laws, expands assault weapons ban","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday signed a sweeping package of gun control bills, banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and expanding the definition of prohibited assault weapons in the wake of mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando. Democrats in the legislature rushed the measures through in hopes of passing them before their summer break, in part to try to forestall a competing gun control proposal headed for the November ballot.  California already has some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation, but after the shooting spree in the Southern California city of San Bernardino last December, lawmakers began work on measures they said would close unintended loopholes. ‚ÄúMy goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,‚Äù Brown said in a signing measure. It was a rare success for advocates of greater gun control.      U.S. lawmakers have fallen short in attempts to tighten gun laws after the killing of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last month.  Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a measure on Friday that would give authorities three days to prove that someone on a terrorism watch list should not be allowed to obtain a firearm. But Democrats rejected it as ‚Äútoothless.‚Äù The bills signed by Brown ban so-called bullet buttons, which allow quick changes in the magazine of a military-style weapon, and require background checks for purchasers of ammunition. Ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 bullets at a time will also be banned, and background checks will be needed for people borrowing guns from non-family members. Brown also vetoed several bills, including one that would have allowed co-workers, educators and mental health professionals to request restraining orders forbidding people deemed dangerous from owning guns.  Gun rights advocates called bills a ‚ÄúGunpocalypse.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe California Legislature showed their true faces today,‚Äù said Craig DeLuz, spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition. ‚ÄúThey abused the legislative process to enact their depraved anti-civil rights agenda.‚Äù Their efforts spilled into intra-party politics as well, after Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who is expected to run for governor in 2018, gathered enough signatures to place his own gun control referendum on the November ballot.  The move angered the state Senate‚Äôs top Democrat, Kevin de Leon, who had been working to pass many of the same measures through the legislature.  Worried in part that Newsom‚Äôs initiative would boost turnout in November among Republicans who oppose gun control, legislative Democrats rushed to pass their bills in time for Newsom to withdraw his measure. But the lieutenant governor refused. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs steps in the right direction will grow into a giant leap forward for public safety if voters pass the Safety for All initiative to keep guns and ammo out of the wrong hands,‚Äù he said.

Clinton's lead over Trump narrows to 9 points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lead over Republican Donald Trump has dipped into the single digits among likely U.S. voters for the first time in nearly two weeks, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The June 27-July 1 poll showed a 9.4 percentage point lead for the former secretary of state over the New York businessman, down slightly from an 11.2 point lead in a previous five-day poll that ended on June 28. Clinton had maintained a double-digit lead in the rolling poll since June 20, as she recovered from a brief boost in Trump‚Äôs numbers in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, when he renewed a call for a ban on Muslim immigration. Among likely voters, 43.9 percent now support Clinton, compared with 34.5 percent for Trump. Another 21.7 percent of likely voters wouldn‚Äôt support either candidate. Clinton is more popular among men and women, young people and minorities, college graduates, and people who live on incomes that are both lower and higher than the national average. Trump has an edge among whites, people with lower levels of education, older Americans and retirees, and he leads among people who frequently attend church. Overall, voters have increasingly sided with Clinton since mid-May, when the two were about even in the poll.  Trump is expected officially to become the Republican presidential nominee when the party holds its convention in another 2-1/2 weeks. Clinton is expected to become the Democratic nominee when the Democrats hold their convention a week later. The poll, which included responses from 1,080 likely voters, has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.5 percentage points. Clinton‚Äôs lead had widened to as much as 14 percentage points in the past two weeks as Republican leaders criticized Trump for his opposition to international trade agreements and a string of nativist comments about Hipsanics and Muslims. Clinton‚Äôs campaign, meanwhile, has been dogged by allegations that she mishandled classified emails and failed to protect U.S. diplomats in Libya while secretary of state in Obama‚Äôs first administration. She denies wrongdoing.   ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2016 "
U.S. attorney general to accept FBI findings in Clinton email probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, seeking to tamp down a firestorm over meeting with former President Bill Clinton, said on Friday she will accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI director on whether to charge Hillary Clinton for mishandling emails. The United States‚Äô top law enforcement officer, however, stopped short of saying she would recuse herself from the investigation of the Democratic presidential candidate. ‚ÄúI will be informed of those findings, as opposed to never reading them or never seeing them, but I will be accepting their recommendations and their plan for going forward,‚Äù Lynch said. She was responding to questions from a Washington Post journalist who was introducing a talk by Lynch at the Aspen Ideas Festival, a gathering of government, technology and other business leaders in Aspen, Colorado. Republicans, including presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have said a political appointee like Lynch should not be involved in the email investigation and that the Monday night meeting with Bill Clinton shows Lynch is too close to the Clintons. With a regretful tone, Lynch said on Friday she would not privately meet with Bill Clinton again and that she understood how the meeting ‚Äúcasts a shadow‚Äù over the perception of the Justice Department‚Äôs probe into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email use. The attorney general said she has received many questions about her role in the investigation and ‚Äúwhether someone who was a political appointee would be involved in deciding how to investigate.‚Äù  Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server while secretary of state, saying the Obama administration‚Äôs Justice Department could not be free of bias.  In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a daily news briefing that the investigation is being handled completely independently of the White House and President Barack Obama. Lynch was appointed by the Democratic president and sworn in on April 1, 2015, well after Hillary Clinton left Obama‚Äôs Cabinet in 2013. Career prosecutors are not appointed by a president and may serve through different administrations. The FBI director is appointed by the president but is not part of his Cabinet and is considered apolitical.   Lynch said on Friday that she had already decided to accept whatever recommendations prosecutors presented her before her meeting with Bill Clinton.  The private meeting with the former president took place on Lynch‚Äôs plane after she landed in Phoenix on Monday night. Bill Clinton was leaving the airport after a rally for his wife earlier that day. Lynch told reporters earlier this week that she did not discuss the email probe or other matters pending before the Justice Department with Bill Clinton, calling their meeting ‚Äúprimarily social.‚Äù  The FBI is investigating Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email use and whether laws were broken as a result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state, an issue that has overshadowed her campaign. She apologized last year for using the server, saying that while she did nothing wrong, she should have used two email accounts: one for State Department business and another for personal matters. Representatives for her campaign could not be reached immediately for comment on Friday.  Trump on Thursday called Lynch‚Äôs meeting ‚Äúa sneak‚Äù and questioned the judgment of both Bill Clinton and the attorney general. In a tweet on Friday, the wealthy businessman said the meeting showed the U.S. political system was ‚Äútotally rigged‚Äù and that Hillary Clinton had bad judgment.  ‚ÄúBill‚Äôs meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!‚Äù Trump said on Twitter. The Justice Department, along with the White House, has said the probe should be free of political interference. ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2016 "
Puerto Rico says will default on $779 million of senior debt,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico on Friday said it will default on $779 million worth of constitutionally backed debt, its most senior bonds, making good on threats that the island would choose paying essential services for its citizens over obligations to creditors. Debt payments totaling just over $2 billion were due on Friday. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla told reporters on Friday that overall the U.S. commonwealth territory will not pay $911 million worth of its obligations. The U.S. territory‚Äôs finances will soon come under a U.S. federal oversight board after U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law on Thursday a bill giving the island access to a debt restructuring process, and implementing a halt on litigation arising from any defaults on its $70 billion debt load. ‚ÄúToday, Puerto Rico is protected against creditors‚Äô actions,‚Äù Garcia Padilla said. The General Obligation (GO) debt, or debt that carries a GO guarantee, is a category of debt that has not been defaulted upon by any U.S. state in decades. Puerto Rico is not covered by Chapter 9 U.S. bankruptcy code which applies to municipalities. Puerto Rico‚Äôs Government Development Bank (GDB) said on Friday the island would have just $95 million in cash at the end of the year even after the defaults announced on Friday. Puerto Rico‚Äôs benchmark 2035 GO bond rose 0.25 points in price to trade at 67.50 points, pushing the yield down to 12.519 percent. On Thursday Garcia Padilla authorized Puerto Rico, under a locally written debt moratorium law, to suspend some of the $2 billion in debt payments due on Friday. The developments on Friday represent the nadir of a decade-long effort by Puerto Rico to avoid economic collapse. The island is hamstrung by emigration and a 45 percent poverty rate. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúEven if the Commonwealth were to devote every last penny in the (accounts) to debt service on July 1, it would still owe holders of the public debt hundreds of millions of dollars,‚Äù the GDB said in a statement on Friday. Some of the debt expected to be defaulted upon such as PBA (Public Building Authority) ex-series L bonds will be mostly covered by reserve funds held by the trustee bank. Nearly all of the payments due on the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority (PRIFA) Bond Anticipation Notes (BANs) will be covered by reserve funds as well. ¬†¬†¬† If some of the debt is covered by insurance policies, some creditors could receive a portion of their payments. ¬† ¬† The GDB, Puerto Rico‚Äôs primary fiscal agent, said the island has only $200 million in its operating account, and another $150 million in revenue that was redirected in recent months away from other debt payments.¬† ¬† ¬† Even if the island continues emergency measures like suspending vendor payments and withholding contributions to a pension fund that is already insolvent, the operating account will still run out of cash in 30 to 60 days, the GDB said. ‚ÄúWe knew this day would come, that they would default, and it is here. It was a good thing they passed PROMESA, even at the eleventh hour,‚Äù Ted Hampton, senior credit officer at Moody‚Äôs Investors Service, said, referring to the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA). Late on Thursday the island‚Äôs legislature approved an $8.9 billion fiscal 2017 budget, which now awaits Garcia Padilla‚Äôs signature. In the wee hours of Friday, Puerto Rico released long-awaited audited financial statements for fiscal year 2014, more than a year late. ¬†¬†¬† The statements, audited by KPMG, showed, among other things, that Puerto Rico‚Äôs largest public pension has exhausted its assets and is now insolvent. Puerto Rico‚Äôs pensions have among the largest funding gaps in U.S. history. ‚ÄúWhen I entered office, Puerto Rico was property of Wall Street,‚Äù Garcia Padilla said, adding: ‚ÄúToday, everybody concludes that we have been telling the truth about Puerto Rico‚Äôs fiscal condition.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2016 "
Trump to meet Indiana Governor Mike Pence over the weekend,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump will meet this weekend with Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Pence spokesman said on Friday, after a report the governor was being vetted as a potential running mate for the Republican presidential candidate. As the Republican candidate for vice president, Pence, a social conservative from a Midwestern state, could help the real estate mogul reassure wary Republicans. The governor, who faces a tight race for re-election to a second term in Indiana, has praised Trump in the past but did not back him in the Republican Party‚Äôs nominating race. ‚ÄúGovernor Pence has accepted an invitation to spend a little time with Mr. Trump this weekend,‚Äù said Marc Lotter, deputy campaign manager of Pence‚Äôs re-election effort. ‚ÄúThis meeting is very consistent with meetings Mr. Trump is holding with many key party leaders.‚Äù Earlier, MSNBC, citing unnamed sources, said Trump is considering Pence, 57, as a potential running mate. The network, which first reported the upcoming meeting, said it was part of the vetting process. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich are also under consideration to be Trump‚Äôs running mate, sources told Reuters.  ‚ÄúTrump is meeting with a number of Republican leaders in the run-up to the convention in Cleveland, and he has a good relationship with Gov. Pence,‚Äù Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said in an email. Republicans will hold their party convention July 18-21 in Cleveland to formally pick their nominee ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump, 70, a real estate mogul and former television reality star, was scheduled to speak at rally in Colorado on Friday. He has said he has narrowed down his potential running mates to five or six contenders, according to media reports. On Thursday, Pence told reporters he had not spoken with Trump since before Indiana‚Äôs May 3 primary contest, MSNBC said.

Federal judge blocks Florida law to end abortion clinic funding,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A federal judge has blocked parts of a new Florida law aiming to cut off state funding for preventive health services at clinics that also provide abortions, acting shortly before the restrictions took effect on Friday. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle issued a preliminary injunction late on Thursday after state Planned Parenthood affiliates challenged certain provisions as unconstitutional. Hinkle found the clinics were unacceptably targeted by state efforts to eliminate funding for other healthcare services they also provide, such as birth control and screening for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases. ‚ÄúThe state‚Äôs only beef is that the plaintiffs provide abortions,‚Äù he wrote, noting that Florida already prohibits funding for abortions, as courts have held permissible. Florida is among many states adopting new abortion laws as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Supporters argued that the wide-ranging law adopted this spring in Florida would protect women‚Äôs health. It included restrictions similar to those in a Texas law that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down earlier this week. Planned Parenthood, however, did not challenge in its lawsuit a related provision requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a type of formal affiliation that can be difficult to obtain. The organization‚Äôs lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for Northern District of Florida, focused on the funding cuts, which it said jeopardized about $500,000 annually. Planned Parenthood also challenged a new requirement that state inspectors review 50 percent of patient medical records at abortion clinics. Hinkle‚Äôs 25-page injunction also blocked the additional inspections, noting that the volume requirements for abortion clinics far exceeded the standards for other medical facilities. ‚ÄúThe inspection provision is a solution in search of a problem,‚Äù Hinkle wrote. In the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood also raised concerns about changes in how the state defines gestational stages. The terminology was clarified during a court hearing, said Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, who applauded the judge‚Äôs ruling. ‚ÄúThis means this vital programs will continue to go forward,‚Äù she said in a phone interview. ‚ÄúBecause anti-women‚Äôs health politicians want to end abortion, they went to the lengths of trying to stop these preventive services.‚Äù  The Florida Department of Health, named in the lawsuit, did not immediately provide comment. Neither did the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican. ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2016 "

The drone campaign has come under criticism by human rights groups and others who say the strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Libya have caused civilian casualties.

Obama says Congress must end deadlock on Zika funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday said Congress must end its deadlock on funding to combat the Zika virus before lawmakers head out to recess later this summer. ‚ÄúThe good news is we feel fairly confident that we can develop an effective vaccine for Zika,‚Äù Obama said after a meeting with U.S. health officials in the Oval Office. ‚ÄúThe problem is right now that money is stuck in Congress.‚Äù Obama met with the heads of the Health and Human Services Department, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to discuss the nation‚Äôs response to the mosquito-borne virus. Earlier this week, Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal to provide $1.1 billion in funding to combat Zika. Democrats and the White House said the plan fell short of Obama‚Äôs $1.9 billion funding request and included measures that would take funds from other important health initiatives. ‚ÄúWe have not seen the House (of Representatives) and Senate come together in a sensible way to put forward the dollars that we have requested to get the job done,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúI expect Congress to get this funding done before they adjourn, as part of their basic responsibility.‚Äù U.S. lawmakers typically go on recess in August to go campaign for re-election in their home districts.  Following the deadlock, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have accused each other of playing politics with the health crisis. Zika has caused concern throughout the Americas due to an alarming rise in cases of the birth defect known as microcephaly and other severe fetal brain abnormalities linked to the virus reported in Brazil, the country hardest hit by the outbreak.  Infants with microcephaly tend to have abnormally small heads and may experience potentially disabling developmental problems. While Obama said there have not been any cases reported of local transmission of the virus in the continental United States, he said the nation is home to mosquitoes that carry the virus. ‚ÄúIt is absolutely critical for the United States government, working in concert with other governments in the hemisphere, to be pushing hard right now to get this situation under control,‚Äù Obama said. As of June 23, there have been seven babies born in the United States with microcephaly or other Zika-related birth defects such as serious brain abnormalities, and five lost pregnancies from either miscarriage, stillbirth or termination.

Trump floats idea of using NATO in fight against Islamic State,"WASHINGTON - Republican Donald Trump said on Thursday that if elected president Nov. 8 he would be open to drawing NATO forces into the fight against Islamic State militants in a new mission for an alliance he has called obsolete. Trump made the comments in an interview with ABC News. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has for months raised questions about the money the United States pours into NATO, which he says needs to be reconfigured to take account of today‚Äôs threats. ‚ÄúI like the idea of using NATO and also neighbors that aren‚Äôt in NATO and take them out. You gotta take them out,‚Äù Trump said. Under President Barack Obama, the United States has relied heavily on U.S. airstrikes to attack Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. Republicans have criticized this policy as not enough to stop the militants. Trump said the idea of using the Cold War-era alliance would be to ease the load on American forces. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get too much of ours involved. I want NATO to be involved,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe spend a tremendous amount of money on NATO. We take care of countries that frankly should be taking care of themselves in terms of economically.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs comments came amid an uproar over a meeting between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a time when Clinton‚Äôs wife, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is under federal investigation. The private meeting took place on Lynch‚Äôs plane after she landed in Phoenix on Monday night and Bill Clinton was leaving the airport after a rally he held for his wife earlier that day. Hillary Clinton is under an FBI investigation for her use of a private email server when she was President Barack Obama‚Äôs first-term secretary of state. Trump told conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher that the meeting was proof of his charge that the U.S. political system is ‚Äúrigged‚Äù in favor of political elites. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unheard of,‚Äù Trump told ABC News. ‚ÄúYou have this massive investigation on emails and they‚Äôd have a meeting like this.‚Äù Lynch, appointed to her position by Obama more than a year ago, said she did not discuss the email investigation or other pending matters before the Justice Department with Bill Clinton.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhen I was landing at the airport, I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as I was leaving and he spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,‚Äù Lynch told reporters.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúOur conversation was a great deal about grandchildren. It was primarily social and about our travels. He mentioned the golf he played in Phoenix and he mentioned travels he had to West Virginia...But there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending before any other body,‚Äù Lynch said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating Hillary Clinton about her email use and has already interviewed some of her aides. The investigation into whether laws were broken as a result of the server kept in her New York home has overshadowed Clinton‚Äôs campaign. Obama is preparing to campaign with Hillary Clinton for the first time in her 2016 White House bid. They are to appear together in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed Clinton 11 points ahead of the billionaire businessman    At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest made clear that Obama believes an impartial investigation is crucial and noted that Lynch had said the conversation was benign.  ¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI think the bottom line is simply that both the president and the attorney general understand how important it is for the Department of Justice to conduct investigations that are free of political interference,‚Äù Earnest told reporters.

Puerto Rico authorizes debt payment suspension; Obama signs rescue bill,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico authorized suspension of payments on its general obligation debt on Thursday just minutes after U.S. President Barack Obama signed a law creating a federal oversight board with authority to negotiate the restructuring of the island‚Äôs $70 billion in debt. The executive order issued by Puerto Rico‚Äôs governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, comes just one day before the U.S. territory was due to make $1.9 billion worth of debt payments on July 1, including some $780 million in constitutionally-backed, general obligation bonds. It remains to be seen whether Puerto Rico will pay part of the GO debt or any of the non-GO debt. ‚ÄúUnder these circumstances, these executive orders protect the limited resources available to the agencies listed in these orders and prevents that these can be seized by creditors, leaving Puerto Ricans without basic services,‚Äù Garcia Padilla‚Äôs administration said in a statement.  The flurry of activity represents the nadir of a decade-long struggle by Puerto Rico, home to 3.5 million Americans, to stave off economic collapse, reverse a 45 percent poverty rate and stem rampant emigration that exacerbates the economy‚Äôs decline.¬† ¬† ¬† Garcia Padilla authorized the suspension of general obligation payments under a previously enacted local debt moratorium law that has already been challenged by a creditor lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.  In addition, Garcia Padilla also declared states of emergency at the island‚Äôs biggest public pension - the Commonwealth‚Äôs Employee Retirement System - which is more than 99 percent underfunded, as well as the University of Puerto Rico and other agencies. Puerto Rico‚Äôs benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond rose 0.44 points in price to trade at 67.19 points, pushing the yield down to 12.578 percent. ¬† ¬† In Washington, Obama signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, in the Oval office on Thursday, one of the few pieces of bi-partisan legislation to make it to his desk. ‚ÄúI want to let the people of Puerto Rico know that although there are still some tough work that we‚Äôre going to have to do to dig Puerto Rico out of the hole that it‚Äôs in, this indicates how committed my administration is to making sure that they get the help they need,‚Äù Obama told reporters before signing it. The law will allow the island access to a bankruptcy-like debt restructuring process, but put its finances under the control of a federally-appointed board ‚Äî a condition that has riled many in Puerto Rico, including Garcia Padilla. PROMESA, which passed the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, puts a stay, or halt, on litigation in the event of a default. Puerto Rico has already defaulted three times on portions of its debt in the last year. The stay is critical to keep Puerto Rico‚Äôs financial restructuring from devolving into a mess of long, costly court battles. The stay is retroactive back to December 2015. The oversight board will have the authority to facilitate consensual restructuring talks, or push Puerto Rico into a court-supervised process akin to U.S. bankruptcy.¬†It will also oversee and monitor the implementation of sustainable budgets. ¬† ¬† Still, missed payments matter for the insurers who have to pay out on claims should Puerto Rico not deliver the cash to its investors. MBIA‚Äôs National Public Finance Guarantee insures about $173 million in GO debt due on Friday, while Assured Guaranty covers another $184 million, and Ambac insures $40 million in GO or GO-guaranteed debt due on Friday.¬† ¬† ¬† The island‚Äôs debt-laden semi-public power utility, PREPA,  earlier on Thursday announced it will make its full, $415 million payment due Friday, under the terms of a restructuring agreement reached late last year with the bulk of its creditors.¬† PREPA, which had been on the brink of collapse under $8.3 billion in debt, last year reached an exchange deal with most of its creditors, which is being finalized.

House of Representatives reignites gun-control debate with planned vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, under mounting pressure to advance gun-control legislation, will vote next week on a measure to keep guns out of the hands of people on government terrorism watch lists. Republican and gun lobby sources said the legislation, due to be introduced as part of a terrorism package, was likely to be a National Rifle Association-backed bill brought by Representative Lee Zeldin of New York as the companion to a Senate Republican measure from Senator John Cornyn of Texas. House Democrats, who last week staged a 25-hour sit-in on the House floor to push for gun control after the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, condemned the Cornyn-Zeldin measure as the handiwork of the NRA. Senate Democrats blocked the same legislation last week.   ‚ÄúHouse Democrats will keep up our efforts to push for the majority to allow a vote on gun violence legislation, but bringing up a bill authored by the NRA just isn‚Äôt going to cut it,‚Äù said Drew Hammill, an aide to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. The NRA denied writing the legislation.  House Speaker Paul Ryan announced the plan in a conference call with lawmakers. Republican leadership aides declined to provide details. One said the package was still being negotiated. After the Orlando, Florida, shooting that killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at a gay nightclub [nL1N19L1WH], gun-control proponents ratcheted up pressure for meaningful legislation.  ‚ÄúWe are going to get something done this year, I predict,‚Äù Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid told reporters. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to take a bite out of the NRA.‚Äù Reid said he was hopeful for a bill introduced by Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and a bipartisan House companion bill backed by Republicans including Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, to prevent gun sales to anyone on the government‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo Fly List‚Äù for terrorism suspects or the ‚ÄúSelectee List‚Äù for extra airport screening.   Before Thursday‚Äôs announcement, Representative Bob Dold of Illinois, a Republican backer of the Collins-Curbelo bill, urged Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to opt for the bipartisan measure, according to a Dold aide. But hopes for a vote on that measure could be dashed if House Republicans move first on the Cornyn-Zeldin bill, which would allow party leaders to say they had acted on gun control.   ‚ÄúIt would really be a sharp blow,‚Äù said Representative Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican and NRA member who supports the Collins-Curbelo measure. The NRA-backed measure would give officials three days to decide whether a gun sale should be blocked. Democrats argue the timetable is insufficient and say the government would have to persuade a court that a would-be buyer ‚Äúhas committed or will commit an act of terrorism‚Äù before it could block a gun sale. Under the Collins-Curbelo bills, a court would have 14 days to decide on appeals. ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 "
Puerto Rico governor authorizes suspension of public debt payments,SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla on Thursday issued an executive order authorizing the suspension of payment on approximately $800 million worth of constitutionally-guaranteed general obligation bonds due on July 1.

U.S. lawmakers push for action on human rights in Bahrain,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven U.S. senators urged Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday to press Bahrain‚Äôs government to do more to promote political and social reform, adding to recent concern in Washington over that country‚Äôs human rights record. The letter said the United States should be prepared to consider ‚Äútangible consequences,‚Äù including reconsidering arms sales, if a recent crackdown on opposition continues. ‚ÄúBahrain‚Äôs failure to address the legitimate grievances of its citizens has strained the country‚Äôs social fabric and invited outside actors to take advantage of the deteriorating situation,‚Äù six Democratic lawmakers and one Republican said in a letter to Kerry, a former Democratic senator. ‚ÄúIndeed, we believe the government‚Äôs harsh crackdown on the political opposition undermines the country‚Äôs stability and plays into the hands of Iran,‚Äù they wrote, calling themselves ‚Äúdeeply alarmed.‚Äù State Department spokesman John Kirby said he was aware of reports about the letter, but had not seen it. Asked about whether U.S. arms provided to Bahrain could be used against the opposition, he said, ‚ÄúWe always have concerns about the end use of items that are inside the foreign military sales program.‚Äù Bahrain, which hosts the United States‚Äô Fifth Fleet and is seen by Sunni-ruled Gulf kingdoms as a strategic bulwark against Iranian influence, drew U.S. and United Nations criticism this month when it moved to strip a top Shi‚Äôite cleric‚Äôs citizenship and closed the main Shi‚Äôite opposition group.  A State Department report, first reported by Reuters, found Bahrain‚Äôs national reconciliation efforts after it crushed street protests in 2011 have stalled, and said the Western ally in the Gulf has not implemented recommendations to protect freedom of expression. ‚ÄúWe continue to urge the government of Bahrain to reverse their recent harmful actions,‚Äù Kirby said a news briefing on Thursday. Earlier this week, the State Department said Bahrain‚Äôs plan to try an activist for tweets condemning its prison system and involvement in the war in Yemen is worrisome to the United States. The letter was led by Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and also signed by Republican Marco Rubio and Democrats Patrick Leahy, Ron Wyden, Bob Casey, Chris Coons and Tim Kaine. It asked for more information on specific actions President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration is taking to press Bahrain‚Äôs leadership on the issue. ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 "
Obama to sign Puerto Rico debt bill on Thursday: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is set to sign into law a relief plan to help Puerto Rico address its $70 billion debt, the White House said.

Puerto Rico's PREPA says will make full debt payment on Friday,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico‚Äôs semi-public power utility, known as PREPA, on Thursday said it would make all of a $415 million debt payment due on Friday, a relief for bond insurers who might have been on the hook in the event of default.     PREPA, which had been on the brink of collapse under $8.3 billion in debt, last year reached an exchange deal with most of its creditors, which is being finalized. On Thursday, the utility said it would make its $415 million payment using operational funds and proceeds from the new bond sales. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs outcome is another step toward PREPA‚Äôs transformation,‚Äù Lisa Donahue, the utility‚Äôs chief restructuring officer, said in a statement. The payment is not a shock because PREPA and its creditors have had the framework of a restructuring deal in place since December. But debt payments in the U.S. territory are being watched closely as the island is expected to default on pieces of $1.9 billion owed on Friday, and President Barack Obama prepares to sign a bill putting the island‚Äôs finances under federal oversight. Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in total debt, a stalled economy, and high poverty and unemployment. The $1.9 billion due on Friday - of which PREPA‚Äôs payment was a portion - includes nearly $800 million in general obligation (GO) debt, the island‚Äôs highest-ranking debt protected by a constitutional pledge. It was unclear on Thursday whether Puerto Rico would make that payment. On Wednesday night, the U.S. Senate passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which Obama has said he will sign, providing for a bankruptcy-like debt restructuring process for Puerto Rico, as well as federal oversight of its finances. While PROMESA contemplates a stay on litigation in the event of default, missed payments matter for the insurers who have to pay out on claims. MBIA‚Äôs National Public Finance Guarantee insures about $139 million of the PREPA payment due on Friday, while Assured Guaranty covers about $35 million. National insures another $211 million in other debt due on Friday, including $173 million in GO debt, a company spokesman said on Wednesday. Assured covers another $329 million due Friday, about $184 million of which is GO debt, a spokeswoman said. Ambac, which insures more than $2 billion of Puerto Rican bonds, is on the hook for $122 million in principal and interest due on Friday, including some $40 million in GO or GO-guaranteed debt, according to the company‚Äôs public documents.

Albanian town backs Clinton with bronze bust,"SARANDE, Albania (Reuters) - Whatever the outcome of November‚Äôs U.S. presidential election, the Albanian town of Sarande is backing Hillary Clinton by erecting a bronze bust to thank her for supporting Albanian causes. Albania is a staunch ally of the United States and has a history of commemorating its presidents.  Woodrow Wilson has a statue there for helping foster the young Albanian state. So does George W. Bush, who visited Albania in 2007 and backed the independence of Kosovo, whose population is mainly ethnic Albanian. Bill Clinton has a statue in Kosovo in recognition of his role in the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 in support of Kosovo. ‚ÄúThis bust in our most central public space is an expression of our gratitude through Mrs. Clinton to the American people and state for what they have done for the Albanian people and nation,‚Äù Sarande Mayor Florjana Koka told a small crowd. It was also a tribute to Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, as an example to women in politics, said Koka, the first female mayor of Sarande. American tourist Jessica Rightmayer wiped away tears as the U.S. national anthem was played. ‚ÄúI think it is beautiful and I really think it is a very good likeness,‚Äù she said. Sculptor Idriz Balani said the idea for the statue came to him when Hillary Clinton told the Albanian parliament in 2012 that Albania and the United States had together marked the Balkan country‚Äôs first centenary and would be friends for another 100 years. Her ‚Äúcharm, elegance and vitality‚Äù had convinced him to sculpt her. ‚ÄúI used three photos to get her smile, hair, posture and attire right and kept the necklace. She exudes benevolence.

Panel's report reignites debate over Clinton and Benghazi,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans on Tuesday accused Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department of failing to protect four Americans killed in a 2012 attack in Libya, in a final report that contained no major new revelations but rekindled debate on the U.S. presidential campaign trail. In an 800-page report that Democrats derided as a political vendetta, Republicans said Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and her staff showed a ‚Äúshameful‚Äù lack of response to congressional investigators looking into the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The report, the culmination of a two-year investigation by a special congressional committee led by Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, is likely to be the last official attempt to investigate the attack. Seven other congressional panels have also investigated the attack on the U.S. diplomatic and CIA posts in Benghazi. The latest investigation has been used by Republicans to attack Clinton‚Äôs national-security credentials. Opinion polls have shown Americans deeply split along partisan lines over the probe. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly charged that Clinton is personally responsible for the deaths of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans killed by militia groups in the Sept. 11, 2012 incident. Clinton‚Äôs campaign dismissed the committee‚Äôs report, saying it had not found anything that had not been discovered by previous congressional probes. White House press secretary Josh Earnest labeled the effort a ‚Äúpolitical exercise.‚Äù Clinton, speaking in Denver, said it was crucial to ‚Äúlearn the right lessons‚Äù from the Benghazi tragedy. ‚ÄúNo one has thought more about or lost more sleep over the lives that we lost - the four Americans - which was devastating,‚Äù said Clinton. Trump waited until hours after the report‚Äôs release to comment. ‚ÄúBenghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure,‚Äù he said on Twitter. ‚ÄúIt just never seems to work the way it‚Äôs supposed to with Clinton.‚Äù Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Clinton‚Äôs actions as secretary of state were ‚Äúdisqualifying.‚Äù ‚ÄúHillary Clinton was in charge, knew the risks, and did nothing‚Äù to protect personnel on the ground in Libya, he said. Professor Julian Zelizer, a political analyst at Princeton University, called the report ‚Äúold news‚Äù but said that would not stop Trump from trying to exploit the issue going forward. ‚ÄúA story like this, even though it seems familiar, can still serve to mobilize Republicans, and certainly Donald Trump will do that. He‚Äôll certainly try,‚Äù Zelizer said.  Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist, said he doubted the report would influence undecided voters. ‚ÄúThose who are willing to believe that there was wrongdoing on Secretary Clinton‚Äôs part were unlikely willing to vote for her in the first place,‚Äù he said. At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Gowdy, chairman of the special congressional panel, said there was a disconnect between the violence unfolding in Benghazi and the perception among top Obama administration officials that ‚Äúthe fighting had subsided‚Äù at the U.S. diplomatic compound. The committee‚Äôs report faulted the State Department for providing inadequate security for the U.S. compound in Benghazi, State Department officials and the CIA for failing to properly evaluate the threat to U.S. personnel on the ground, and the Pentagon for not being in position to aid the Americans under siege. The report did not dispute assertions by the Obama administration that such a mission would have come too late to help the four who were killed. None of those conclusions, however, came as revelations. All had been reached by previous probes. The report also accused the White House of stonewalling the investigation, something aides to Obama have denied. Democrats on the Benghazi committee issued their own report a day before Tuesday‚Äôs release, accusing Republicans of conducting an overzealous investigation. According to a website maintained by committee Democrats, the investigation cost more than $7.1 million, a figure that excludes money spent on investigations by the seven other congressional committees that investigated the attacks. The Gowdy committee investigation lasted 782 days, longer than congressional probes of Pearl Harbor, the Kennedy assassination, the Iran-Contra scandal and Hurricane Katrina. Since it was established in May 2014, the Gowdy committee has held four public hearings, according to its website, which said that it interviewed 107 witnesses, mostly behind closed doors, including 81 who never appeared before the other committees that investigated the attacks. It reviewed about 75,000 pages of previously unexamined documents. Last October, Clinton, already a Democratic presidential candidate, calmly deflected harsh Republican criticism of her handling of the attack during a testy 11-hour hearing before the Gowdy committee. In testimony that stretched deep into the night, Clinton rejected Republican accusations that she ignored requests for security upgrades in Libya and misinformed the public about the cause of the attack. Clinton‚Äôs appearance before the panel followed months of controversy about her use of a private home email server for her State Department work, a disclosure that emerged in part because of the panel‚Äôs demand to see her official records. A 2012 report by a government accountability review board faulted State Department officials for providing ‚Äúgrossly‚Äù insufficient security in Benghazi, despite upgrade requests from Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and others in Libya. ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 "
Zika sex research begins despite U.S. Congress funding impasse,"(Reuters) - It could take years to learn how long men infected with Zika are capable of sexually transmitting the virus, which can cause crippling birth defects and other serious neurological disorders. In the meantime, health officials have warned couples to refrain from unprotected sex for six months after a male partner is infected. The extraordinary recommendation, based on a single report of Zika surviving 62 days in semen, could affect millions. The grave risks associated with Zika, along with its potential reach, are driving U.S. health authorities to pursue research even though funding is mired in Congressional gridlock. A study of sexual transmission risk is one example of science that health officials said can‚Äôt wait for politics. Borrowing money earmarked for other programs, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has started enrolling men infected with Zika in Brazil and Colombia in the study to determine how long the virus remains transmittable in semen. The study could take years to complete, but interim results could help public health officials fine-tune their recommendations on sex. ‚ÄúWe are going out on a limb, but we have to,‚Äù Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. institute, said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say we‚Äôre going to wait until we get all the money.‚Äù Public health officials are alarmed by Zika‚Äôs transmission versatility, which has the potential to expand its reach. It is primarily spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, as are the dengue and chikungunya viruses. But at least 10 countries, including the United States and France, have reported Zika infections in people who had not traveled to an outbreak area but whose sexual partners had. This ability to spread through sex could help Zika gain a further foothold outside the warm habitats of its most effective agent, the mosquito. To protect women who are pregnant or trying to conceive, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended couples refrain from unprotected sex for six months - triple the 62 days the virus survived in the semen in one British case study. The World Health Organization recently issued similar guidance. But such strict advice is not ideal, Dr. Anne Schuchat, a CDC deputy director, said in an interview. ‚ÄúTo tell people not to have sex until we get back to you is not a very satisfying recommendation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe would like to have some more understanding of the sexual risk.‚Äù In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where more than 2,100 cases of infection have been reported since the start of the year, health officials are passing out Zika protection kits that include bug spray and condoms, along with the recommendation. But the warning against unprotected sex isn‚Äôt going over very well, said Dr. Chris Prue, a CDC behavioral scientist who has studied the response. ‚ÄúCondoms are not popular in a lot places,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs religious and personal preferences and lots of personal factors in that.‚Äù U.S. lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the Zika virus on Tuesday, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the virus and hurt other health priorities. It was unclear when Congress would revisit the request by President Barack Obama for $1.9 billion. In the meantime, the White House has diverted more than $500 million earmarked for other projects for urgent Zika initiatives, including those where scientific opportunities will be lost if not acted upon immediately. One such study will follow children born to women infected with Zika to identify the development of any disabilities not detected at birth. Other projects on the priority list include vaccine development and mosquito eradication. ¬†  One study underway will assess whether the risk of transmission is greater from men who experience Zika infection symptoms, such as fever and rash, than from those who don‚Äôt. This information is considered vital since most people experience no symptoms. The study of infected men in Brazil and Colombia will test semen from thousands of men over time to determine how long Zika poses a risk to sexual partners. As long the virus can be grown in a laboratory from semen cell samples, infectious disease experts believe it is potentially contagious. Zika typically clears the bloodstream about a week after infection, but it has been detected in urine for at least twice as long. Its persistence in semen in the British case study has caused some researchers to draw comparisons to other viruses. HIV can last in blood and semen indefinitely, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus can reside in the kidneys and urine for years, researchers said. One patient who survived the deadly Ebola outbreak had evidence of that virus in his semen for 18 months. ‚ÄúWe got very surprised by Ebola that it was hanging around for so long,‚Äù said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. ‚ÄúOne of the big questions we have to ask is does Zika also cause a similar type of latency?‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 "
"Senate passes Puerto Rico debt bill, sends to Obama","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate gave solid approval on Wednesday to a relief plan to help Puerto Rico address its $70 billion debt, sending the measure to President Obama for his signing into law just ahead of a possible default by the U.S. territory on its next debt payment. The measure passed the Senate on a vote of 68-30, and President Obama said in a statement he looked forward to signing the bill into law. The House of Representatives has already approved the bill. ‚ÄúThis bill is not perfect, but it is a critical first step toward economic recovery and restored hope for millions of Americans who call Puerto Rico home,‚Äù Obama said.  The legislation would create a federal oversight board, appointed by Washington, with power to restructure Puerto Rico‚Äôs unmanageable debt load. The bill provides for a stay, or halt, to any litigation brought against the Puerto Rican government and its debt issuing agencies that is retroactive to December. This provides breathing room for the board to start the process of restructuring and oversee a sustainable budget process.  On Friday, Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make $1.9 billion worth of payments. Puerto Rico‚Äôs Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said the island will default some of the debt. Supporters said intervention by Washington lawmakers was necessary to help the island‚Äôs 3.5 million U.S. citizens avert a ‚Äúdescent into chaos,‚Äù as U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday. Puerto Rico has been waiting for months for Congress to act as its economic crisis worsened. It has already defaulted on some of its debt. The Caribbean island territory is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, as well as a steady flow of migration to the U.S. mainland that shrinks its tax base and shuttering of essential services. In addition, it is suffering from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry. But many Puerto Ricans are leery of the proposed oversight board, fearing it could usurp the island‚Äôs government and place investors‚Äô concerns over local¬†priorities.  Puerto Rico‚Äôs benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond rose 1 full point in price ahead of the final vote, to trade at 66.75 points, pushing the yield down to 12.663 percent.  Passage of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) came after leaders of both political parties warned that failure to approve the legislation could lead to a U.S. taxpayer-funded bailout. ‚ÄúThis is the best and possibly the only action we can take to help Puerto Rico,‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said. ‚ÄúDoing nothing now ... (is) the surest route to both a taxpayer funded bailout of Puerto Rico and a humanitarian crisis for its people,‚Äù McConnell said. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he shared the concerns of many Democrats with the ‚Äúexcessive powers¬†and appointment structure‚Äù of the oversight board, and he was unhappy with some labor provisions. But Reid said he was voting for passage because Puerto Rico needed the help by Friday. ‚ÄúOtherwise we ... turn them¬† over to the hedge funds and they will sue them to death,‚Äù he said. The seven member board, appointed by President Obama from recommendations given by party leaders in both the House and Senate, is supposed to be in place by Sept. 1, 2016. Neither political party was entirely happy with the fix. Democrats bridled at a Republican provision that might lower the minimum wage for some young workers and weaken overtime pay rules while some Republicans were concerned the bill could amount to a bailout of the island, or set a precedent for states in fiscal trouble to seek a similar arrangement. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll say if a territory can receive unprecedented authority from Congress, then why shouldn‚Äôt a state?‚Äù asked Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. The legislation is geared toward U.S. territories. Puerto Rico is not covered by current U.S. bankruptcy law under Chapter 9. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, opposing the measure, argued that Friday was an arbitrary deadline for action that did not excuse a ‚Äúflawed‚Äù bill. A vote for the bill was ‚Äúa vote to authorize an unelected, unchecked and all powerful control board to determine Puerto Rico‚Äôs destiny for a generation or more,‚Äù Menendez declared. Some senators, including Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, criticized the estimated $370 million cost of the legislation over five years, complaining that Puerto Rico will get stuck with the tab while it is struggling to reduce its debt. Sanders blasted this as ‚Äúcolonialism at its worst.‚Äù The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which issued that estimate, said that about $350 million of the total ‚Äúwould primarily cover fees of legal and financial consultants hired to restructure Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 29, 2016 "
Obama concerned over longer term global growth after Brexit,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he expects the world economy will be steady in the short run after Britain‚Äôs decision to leave the European Union but expressed concern about longer term global growth. Obama, appearing at a North American summit with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, said there have been reactions in markets, stock prices and currencies since last Thursday‚Äôs so-called Brexit vote. Preparations by central banks, finance ministers and the U.S. treasury secretary helped ensure the global economy will hold steady in the short term, he said at a news conference. ‚ÄúI think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúAt a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesn‚Äôt help.‚Äù The U.S. president, who had openly sided with British Prime Minister David Cameron against Brexit, said the leaders of G20 nations, who will meet in China this year, will have to work to boost global demand and fortify the global economy.  Obama said that, while the special relationship between Britain and the United States will endure, that country‚Äôs absence from the EU would ‚Äúmake it harder for us to solve some of the other challenges that have to be solved.‚Äù He said his main message to Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders involved in the Brexit would be: ‚ÄúEverybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that‚Äôs transparent, that people understand and then proceed, understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right. ‚ÄúAnd I think that will be a difficult, challenging process but it does not need to be a panicky process.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 29, 2016 "
Federal judge rules Ohio can purge inactive voters,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that Ohio‚Äôs secretary of state was within his rights to strip thousands of inactive voters from the rolls, rejecting a legal challenge by civil liberties activists who claimed that the purge disenfranchised minorities and the poor. The decision by U.S. District Judge George C. Smith in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union could impact the presidential race in Ohio, a key swing state seen as potentially pivotal in the Nov. 8 election. No Republican has won the White House without carrying Ohio.  The ACLU charged in its lawsuit that Ohio Secretary of State John Husted‚Äôs policy of removing from the rolls voters deemed inactive over a six-year period violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 because it targets minorities and lower-income voters who tend to favor Democrats. Smith disagreed, finding that the policy was not illegal because it removed voters from the rolls only after they failed to vote and then did not respond to a change of address confirmation. ‚ÄúOhio‚Äôs procedures of maintaining the voter registration rolls ensure the integrity of the election process,‚Äù Smith wrote. Husted has said that the policy has been in place since the 1990s under both Republican and Democratic secretaries of state. ‚ÄúWhile today‚Äôs ruling reaffirms that the process Ohio has used for over two decades is constitutional and in line with state and federal law, the best news is that we can put another wasteful lawsuit behind us and focus on the important work of running elections in Ohio,‚Äù Husted said in a statement. ¬†¬† ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 "
"Obama: Trump's rhetoric is xenophobic, not populist","OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama is tired of hearing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump described as a populist. The Democratic leader, who has made no secret of his dislike for the wealthy businessman‚Äôs rhetoric, closed a news conference in Canada on Wednesday with a long riff on what makes a leader qualified for the ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù mantra. Trump did not meet the criteria, Obama said, without mentioning the Republican by name. ‚ÄúSomebody ... who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues or making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot at life or have health care,‚Äù does not meet the definition, Obama said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes. That‚Äôs not the measure of populism. That‚Äôs nativism, or xenophobia. Or worse. Or it‚Äôs just cynicism,‚Äù he said. Trump won enough grassroots support among Republicans to make him the party‚Äôs presumptive presidential nominee with a pledge to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, and a series of other inflammatory remarks. Obama has sharply criticized Trump for such rhetoric.  He plans to campaign with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, next week. The president‚Äôs latest criticism of Trump could foreshadow Obama‚Äôs strategy to help Clinton on the campaign trail.  He made a point of saying U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton‚Äôs opponent in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, genuinely deserved the title of populist.  Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist and generated huge support from young people across the United States in his campaign. Clinton needs those supporters now, and Obama, who won the White House in 2008 and 2012 with a similar coalition, will try to help deliver them for her. Obama, who leaves office in January, made his comments on Wednesday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto looking on. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Obama said after his more-than-six-minute monologue. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the prerogative of an outgoing president to go on an occasional rant, he said.

Trump's opposition to trade deals fuels internal party opposition,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce‚Äôs scathing criticism of his stance on trade, highlighting divisions within the Republican Party that threaten unity ahead of the Nov. 8 election. At a campaign rally in Maine on Wednesday, Trump called the nation‚Äôs largest business association ‚Äúcontrolled totally by various groups of people who don‚Äôt care about you whatsoever.‚Äù He said new trade deals should be negotiated because foreign countries are taking advantage of America. ‚ÄúEvery country that we do business with us look at us as the stupid people with the penny bank,‚Äù Trump said Wednesday at the rally in Bangor, Maine. The Washington-based lobbying group, which represents the United States‚Äô largest companies and business interests, is typically a reliable backer of Republican policies.  But on Tuesday it took issue with Trump‚Äôs vocal opposition to trade deals, calling his proposals ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù ideas that would push the United States into another recession. Trump said the Chamber‚Äôs argument that his policies would cause a trade war were incorrect because the United States was already at a deficit.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already losing the trade war, we lost the trade war,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúNothing can happen worse than is happening now.‚Äù In speeches on Tuesday, Trump called for renegotiating or scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, calling it a job killer, and reiterated opposition to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries. He also lambasted China‚Äôs trade and currency policies. The Chamber has consistently backed trade deals.      The public squabbling between the presumptive Republican nominee and the business group was unusual, one of a series of reminders that Trump still struggles to unite his party behind his campaign. The Republicans and many business leaders tend to share policy goals and work in lockstep, and many business leaders have traditionally been big donors to Republican candidates. So far, the Chamber‚Äôs political action committee has donated $134,000 to federal candidates or their committees, with $127,500 of that total going to Republicans, according to U.S. government campaign finance records. Billionaire Republican donor Paul Singer, who bankrolled an effort to try to defeat Trump during the campaign‚Äôs nominating phase, said on Wednesday that a Trump presidency and his trade positions would almost certainly lead to a global depression. ‚ÄúThe most impactful of the economic policies that I recall him coming out for are these anti-trade policies,‚Äù Singer said during a panel discussion at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, according to CNBC. But opposing trade deals has proven a winning strategy for Trump among voters concerned about the loss of manufacturing jobs.  Art Laffer, an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan who supports Trump, said he did not like the tone of Trump‚Äôs speech on Tuesday but thought it was an improvement over his past comments on trade. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not terribly alarming to me,‚Äù Laffer said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see any 45 percent tariffs across the board. ... ‚ÄúI saw negotiating better trade deals rather than throwing away all the trade deals we have now. He points out the flaws in these trades, and that‚Äôs all true,‚Äù Laffer said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the tone of it, but I dislike the tone less today than I did three weeks ago.‚Äù Peter Navarro, a Trump trade policy adviser, defended the candidate‚Äôs position. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the central point to understand: The White House has been utterly and completely soft on China‚Äôs illegal trade practices,‚Äù said Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. ‚ÄúThe status quo is the worst of all possible worlds for the United States.‚Äù  Trump also took fire from for his positions on trade from Democrats. In a call organized by rival Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign, U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a former businessman and tech entrepreneur, said that while the country needed to do a better job protecting workers, more resources should be put into training them for a new economy. He also noted that it was unusual to see a Republican standard-bearer and the Chamber divide.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve really got a special circumstance when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce‚Äù responded to Trump‚Äôs economic plan with a ‚Äúfull-fledged onslaught,‚Äù Warner said. ‚ÄúNo one could have predicted this kind of election season.‚Äù Clinton held no public campaign events on Wednesday but did announce she would appear next week with President Barack Obama, the first time this year that he and his former Secretary of State have campaigned together.

"U.S. farm groups discuss policy with Clinton staff, pursue Trump","CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. agriculture groups are pushing for continuing talks with the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in an effort to influence their farm policy positions as a slump in crop prices squeezes the sector‚Äôs profits. Representatives of about a dozen trade associations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union, met with staffers for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday at her New York campaign headquarters. It was the farm coalition‚Äôs first meeting with Clinton‚Äôs staff and included discussions of issues ranging from agricultural trade and labor to mandatory labels for foods containing genetically modified ingredients, attendees said on Wednesday. The meeting was the start of a push by the sector for more details from Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump about their stances on issues affecting farmers and agribusiness. The groups are seeking a meeting with Trump‚Äôs campaign. ‚ÄúAll of us agreed, on both sides of the table, that it is a successful meeting only if it‚Äôs the first of a number of exchanges,‚Äù said Jay Vroom, the chief executive of pesticide association CropLife America, who attended the session. The candidates‚Äô agriculture policies are crucial, the groups say, because net U.S. farm income is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. If that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013. ‚ÄúWith that kind of climate, we‚Äôre definitely concerned about what farm policy will look like building to the next (congressional) farm bill,‚Äù said Tom Bryant, the National Farmers Union‚Äôs membership director.     If elected, Clinton will increase agricultural production and profitability for family farms, spokesman Tyrone Gayle¬†said. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Matt Paul, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman working with Clinton‚Äôs campaign, participated in the meeting. The gathering came a day after Britain‚Äôs surprise vote to exit the European Union, which drew support from some regions with low population densities. Chandler Goule, incoming CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers, said farm groups drew parallels to Britain‚Äôs referendum because ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be rural America that‚Äôs going to turn out for this election, that‚Äôs actually going to determine the outcome of this (presidential) election.‚Äù Now that Clinton and Trump are the presumed nominees, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to start making more detailed and more in-the-weeds-type commitments,‚Äù he said.

New rules give protesters more leeway at Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday authorized a new plan allowing protesters at next month‚Äôs Republican National Convention in Cleveland to demonstrate in an area that will be readily visible to convention goers. The new plan, approved by U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster, also cuts in half the size of an ‚Äúevent zone‚Äù where demonstrations and mobility will be limited and gives protesters more time to demonstrate. The agreement between the city of Cleveland and the American Civil Liberties Union resolves weeks of wrangling over the rules for what are expected to be lively protests when Donald Trump is due to become the Republican Party‚Äôs official nominee for president at the July 18-21 convention. Trump campaign events have drawn raucous demonstrations,  with some resulting in clashes between his supporters and opponents. ‚ÄúThis settlement is a significant improvement from what the city had previously offered,‚Äù Christine Link, executive director for the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. The ACLU sued on behalf of three groups planning to organize thousands of demonstrators, calling the rules too restrictive. Dan Williams, spokesman for Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, described the changes as ‚Äúminor‚Äù and said he did not believe there would be an increased security risk as a result. Cleveland originally planned to cordon off 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the convention site as an event zone where free speech mobility would be limited.  After another federal judge struck down the city‚Äôs original plan, the two sides settled the lawsuit on Friday and took several days to work out details before revealing the new plan. The event zone is now 1.7 square miles (4.4 square km). The new zone frees up parkland where demonstrators will be able to organize before their protests. It also removes the Port of Cleveland and a small public airport for corporate jets and air taxi services from the restricted area. The main parade route for demonstrators now extends deeper into central Cleveland and will be more visible from the sports arena where the main event will take place, and more within the view of delegates and the media. The previous route took demonstrators further away from the center of town and over a bridge where they would be seen primarily by themselves. In addition, groups were granted extra staging time between protests. The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the businessman‚Äôs campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization.

Facebook's political influence under a microscope,"(Reuters) - As the U.S. presidential campaign heats up, Facebook Inc is going out of its way to show its neutrality - an increasingly urgent matter for the social network as evidence of its power  continues to emerge. Recent studies have shown the site has extraordinary influence. According to research scheduled to be published in August in the Journal of Communication, when people tagged their friends on Facebook in voting reminders, turnout increased by 15 to 24 percent.  During U.S. presidential primary elections this year, a Facebook reminder that informed people when their state‚Äôs voter registration deadline was approaching and provided a link helped produce a surge of nearly 650,000 new voter registrations in California alone, according to Secretary of State Alex Padilla. In the United Kingdom, a Facebook reminder days before the deadline to register to vote on whether the country should exit the European Union led to 186,000 people registering online to vote, according to the government.  ‚ÄúGenerally, getting people out to vote could swing a national election,‚Äù said Katherine Haenschen, a PhD student at the University of Texas, Austin and author of the upcoming Journal of Communications study. Facebook is eager to show that its political involvement is limited to seemingly neutral activities such as encouraging voting. The company this week released some of the guidelines that govern its all-important News Feed - the place most people see postings on Facebook - and has pushed back hard against recent allegations of political bias in its ‚ÄúTrending Topics‚Äù module. At the same time Facebook has embraced its role as a ‚Äúnew town hall‚Äù for politics, hosting events and helping candidates more effectively leverage their platforms, said Katie Harbath, Facebook‚Äôs global politics and government outreach director Her team helps candidates by answering their questions and providing advice, such as how to use Facebook Live and how to increase engagement on their pages.   Still, concerns about Facebook‚Äôs role in shaping political attitudes are unlikely to abate anytime soon. Some people object even to voter-registration drives. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, for example, alleged this week that Google and Facebook were trying to encourage a ‚Äúremain‚Äù vote in Britain‚Äôs referendum on European Union membership by encouraging voting, asserting that media users are disproportionately youthful and pro-Europe.    A more common complaint is that Facebook and other social networks serve as an echo chamber of ideas and beliefs, as users decide which people and pages they will follow and customize their News Feed.   A 2015 study in Science showed that Facebook users tended to interact and click on content that was more in line with their ideological views.  Facebook customer Tom Steinberg wrote in a post this week -one that quickly spread over Twitter - that he had actively looked on Facebook for people celebrating Britain‚Äôs vote to exit the European Union last week but could not find any.  Steinberg, who said he was in favor of remaining in the European Union, urged tech leaders to do more to address the echo chamber on social media.  ‚ÄúTo not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies,‚Äù Steinberg wrote. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting countries where one half just doesn‚Äôt know anything at all about the other.‚Äù  Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management for News Feed, said the team tries to help users find new pages to follow, though he did not cite any specific efforts aimed at encouraging people to diversify their feeds.

U.S. Senate aims to vote later Wednesday on Puerto Rico bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is aiming to finish its work and vote later on Wednesday on final passage of a relief plan to help Puerto Rico address its $70 billion debt, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. The bill cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate on Wednesday morning, and has already passed the House of Representatives.

Biden outlines 'Moonshot' initiatives to fight cancer,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden on Wednesday announced plans as part of the administration‚Äôs ‚ÄúCancer Moonshot‚Äù initiative, aimed at speeding development of treatments by cutting bureaucracy and easing collaboration between scientists, industry, patients and government. Speaking at a cancer summit at Howard University in Washington, Biden made an impassioned plea for increased urgency in the fight against cancer. The event was part of a national day of action involving hundreds of researchers, patient advocates and data experts across the country. Biden‚Äôs son Beau died last year at age 46 from brain cancer, something Biden said helps inform his passion for the project.  ‚ÄúI believe we can do in the next five years what would normally take 10 years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTime matters, days matter, minutes matter.‚Äù Among proposals intended to bypass inefficiency at the federal level, he announced the formation of an Oncology Center of Excellence at the Food and Drug Administration, which will coordinate and review all of FDA cancer treatments. It comes as scientific advances in diagnostics allow for greater tailoring of drugs to an individual‚Äôs genetic profile. It is the first of four potential centers proposed under a bill moving through Congress. Under the existing review system, companies submit products to different divisions of the agency depending on whether it is a drug, device or biologic, a drug made from living cells. A treatment that combines a drug and a diagnostic device could get reviewed on different timelines. ‚ÄúWe are moving into a very complicated area in oncology where drugs and devices and biologics are going to be used in combination or sequentially,‚Äù Dr. Richard Pazdur, the FDA‚Äôs cancer drug director, said in an interview. Pazdur will oversee the establishment of the center and act as its director for the next 120 days, with the potential for the position to be renewed. He will report directly to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf. The ‚ÄúCancer Moonshot‚Äù initiative was announced by President Barack Obama at his State of the Union address in January. Biden outlined a slew of other collaborations and initiatives, including making it easier for patients to find and enter clinical trials through the creation of a cancer trials website and making it easier for scientists to focus on research and less on raising money. ‚ÄúWe have to change the culture that turns scientists into grant writers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have to reward teamwork.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 29, 2016 "

"U.S. lawmakers seek more money, authority for derivatives regulator","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission would have stronger policing powers over the derivatives market, along with a boosted budget, under legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. The bill, introduced by Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warner in the Senate and Elijah Cummings in the House of Representatives, also would add new tasks to the regulator‚Äôs rulemaking agenda. ‚ÄúThe only way to make sure that derivatives can never lead to a financial crisis and taxpayer bailouts again is to put in place clearer rules and stronger oversight,‚Äù Warren said in a statement.  The bill likely will fizzle in the Republican-led Congress. It could also become part of this year‚Äôs election fights, as the relationship between Wall Street and Washington frequently moves to center stage in presidential and congressional campaigns.   Democrats such as Warren, who is campaigning for her party‚Äôs presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton, regard the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law passed after the 2007-09 financial crisis as crucial for preventing another massive meltdown. That law greatly expanded the CFTC‚Äôs reach, as swaps and derivatives had played a key role in the breakdown of banks and other firms. They also seek further regulation, saying vulnerabilities persist in the financial system. The presumptive nominee for the Republican Party, real estate developer and television star Donald Trump wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. Many in the party say the law has gone too far, drying up liquidity and freezing capital. The proposed legislation ‚Äúgives the CFTC a stable funding stream and the tools necessary to help deter future illegal acts by permitting penalties large enough to impact the bottom lines of even the largest financial firms,‚Äù Cummings said. The CFTC currently is funded through annual appropriations from Congress, unlike the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is backed by user fees and fines.  CFTC Chair Timothy Massad has sought a change, saying millions of dollars more in funds would help the agency keep up with technology advancements in the markets it oversees and with ‚Äúhigh-powered defense teams‚Äù in its enforcement cases. Republicans in Congress say the funding process keeps the agency accountable to elected leaders. The Democrats‚Äô bill would move the CFTC to the same model as the SEC. It would also put certain foreign exchange swaps under CFTC jurisdiction, change how derivatives are treated in bankruptcy, require posting initial margin in inter-affiliate swaps, and require regulators to review derivatives clearinghouses.

Puerto Rico debt bill gains backers in U.S. Senate; close vote seen,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration and U.S. Senate Republican leaders scrambled on Tuesday to garner enough support to get a Puerto Rico debt relief bill through a critical procedural vote set for Wednesday which several lawmakers predicted would be close. After months of waiting for Congress to act as Puerto Rico‚Äôs economic crisis progressively worsened, the Caribbean island appeared to be on the verge of securing a relief plan from Washington aimed at helping it address a hobbling $70 billion debt. The leaders of both political parties in the Senate are on board, but the outcome appeared uncertain. The Obama administration sent Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to persuade recalcitrant Democrats, while Republicans heard arguments for the legislation from fellow senators at a closed-door luncheon. ‚ÄúWe will win the vote tomorrow,‚Äù said Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, as he left the meeting with Lew. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters he was ‚Äúvery much on board,‚Äù and was urging Republicans to back the measure establishing a federal oversight board to be in charge of restructuring the U.S. territory‚Äôs debt. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hopeful and optimistic that the (Obama) administration will be able to get Democrats on board, and we believe strongly that it‚Äôs an approach that appeals to most Republicans,‚Äù McConnell said. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he would support the bill. The Senate Democratic whip, Dick Durbin of Illinois, a recent convert to the proposal, said he was trying to get a majority of Democrats to back it.  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi added that while there is much to the legislation she objected to, she implored her Senate colleagues to adopt the bill. ‚ÄúFailure to pass this bill would be a tremendous win for the unscrupulous hedge funds that have held this bill up for six months demanding to be first in line over the needs of the people of Puerto Rico,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúUnless Congress acts, our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico will be plunged into deep economic turmoil in just three days‚Äô time.‚Äù Puerto Rico‚Äôs 3.5 million residents are U.S. citizens. The U.S. territory is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, a steady flow of outward migration to the U.S. mainland that further shrinks its tax base and the shuttering of essential services. But Durbin predicted ‚Äúit will be close‚Äù Wednesday morning, when the Puerto Rico debt relief bill will need a supermajority of 60 senators‚Äô votes to stay alive in the Senate.  And despite McConnell‚Äôs expression of optimism, other Republicans said the leadership appeared worried behind the scenes. ‚ÄúI think leadership is concerned because they‚Äôre really whipping it,‚Äù said Senator Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican. ‚ÄúWhen they whipped me last night, I said ‚Äòno‚Äô. So they‚Äôre coming back and asking if I‚Äôll reconsider.‚Äù The White House joined the fray, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying that without action by Congress to help Puerto Rico deal with its debt, the need for a bailout of the U.S. territory will become more likely. The measure is identical to the plan passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month, as Congress tries to send it to President Barack Obama to sign into law by July 1. That is when Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make $1.9 billion in payments.  If the Wednesday morning procedural vote is successful, it would clear the measure for passage this week.  But Republican skeptics of the bill are worried it could constitute a bailout - something its supporters deny - while Democrats have expressed concern about the composition of the oversight board and labor provisions that they say could lower minimum wages for young workers in Puerto Rico. The top Democrat on the Senate Finance committee, Oregon‚Äôs Ron Wyden, announced Tuesday he would back the legislation. But Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown appeared to be wavering even after meeting with Lew, Wyden and other Democrats in a Senate office building.  Brown said he would be more likely to vote ‚Äúyes‚Äù in Wednesday‚Äôs procedural vote if Senate leaders promise him a vote on an unrelated issue - legislation to ensure that the federal government and coal mine operators honor payment of promised pensions and health benefits to retired miners. Lew said he thought there was  ‚Äúbroad understanding‚Äù of the urgency. ‚ÄúI just do not believe that we can let three and a half million Americans descend into chaos,‚Äù he said.

Hispanic claims victory in Harlem race to replace Rangel in U.S. Congress,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dominican-born Adriano Espaillat claimed victory on Tuesday in the U.S. congressional race to succeed longtime Representative Charles Rangel, signaling change in the historically black neighborhood of Harlem that has grown increasingly Hispanic. Nine Democrats ran in the primary to select the party‚Äôs candidate for November‚Äôs general election. In a district where Democratic voters heavily outnumber Republicans, Tuesday‚Äôs winner will have a virtual lock on taking Rangel‚Äôs vacated seat in the House of Representatives. Espaillat, once an illegal immigrant, would be the first Dominican-American member of Congress. A state senator, Espaillat, held a 3-point lead on state Assemblyman Keith Wright, an African-American who was endorsed by Rangel and benefited from the political machine of a man who held the job for 46 years. With 98 percent of polling places reporting, Espaillat had 36.7 percent of the vote compared with 33.7 percent for Wright, a difference of nearly 1,300 votes. ‚ÄúThe voters of the 13th congressional district made history tonight,‚Äù Espaillat, 61, said in a victory speech. ‚ÄúThe voters ... elected a country boy from Santiago de los Caballeros in the Dominican Republic,‚Äù he said, mixing Spanish and English. Wright, however, refused to concede, telling supporters: ‚ÄúNo candidate can declare victory tonight, not until every vote is counted.‚Äù The district is dominated by Harlem, long a leading cultural center, home to black political and commercial life, and an incubator for jazz.  Harlem notably has grown more white with gentrification, but it also has become more Hispanic. Besides Harlem, the district also includes predominantly Latino neighborhoods further to the north where Espaillat has his base. Rangel, 86, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, won his first congressional election in 1970, and since then Harlem voters routinely returned him to office every two years, even after his 2010 censure for ethics violations.  Espaillat tried and failed to unseat Rangel in 2012 and 2014 primary elections. Gentrification emerged as a leading issue in the campaign, as a decade-long influx of affluent people, many of them white, has transformed Harlem‚Äôs once-blighted blocks of 19th century brownstone town houses. Change has muted the distinctive black identity of the area, the home of the Apollo Theater, the Cotton Club and other monuments of African-American culture. Once an upscale Dutch neighborhood named after the city near Amsterdam, Harlem drew African-Americans during the northward migration of former slaves in the late 19th Century and again between the world wars.  In decades past, affluent New Yorkers avoided venturing too far north, or ‚Äúuptown.‚Äù But soaring property values have turned Harlem into one of New York‚Äôs trendiest real estate markets.

"VW agrees to buy back diesel vehicles, fund clean air efforts","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German automaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) will pay as much as $15.3 billion after admitting it cheated on U.S. diesel emissions tests for years, agreeing to buy back vehicles from consumers and provide funding that could benefit makers of cleaner technologies. The largest-ever automotive buyback offer in the United States came in a deal announced on Tuesday by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, Environmental Protection Agency and California state regulators. The proposed consent decree confirmed that VW will set aside $10.033 billion to cover buybacks or fixes for diesel cars and sport utility vehicles that used illegal software to defeat government emissions tests. VW admitted in September that it installed secret software that allowed U.S. vehicles to emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. VW still may face criminal charges and oversight by an independent monitor, a person briefed on the matter said. A criminal settlement could include measures to ensure VW would not engage in further cheating. Shares of VW rose as much as 5 percent on Tuesday, and closed up 1.7 percent at 107.85 euros. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt follow a multiyear, grind-it-out litigation strategy, which would have been counterproductive for Volkswagen,‚Äù said Robert Giuffra Jr., VW‚Äôs lead lawyer.  ‚ÄúWe moved with lightning speed to settle with our federal and state regulators and the private plaintiffs.‚Äù    Under the Justice Department deal, VW will provide $2 billion over 10 years to fund programs directed by California and EPA to promote construction of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, development of zero-emission ride-sharing fleets and other efforts to boost sales of cars that do not burn petroleum. VW also agreed to put up $2.7 billion over three years to enable government and tribal agencies to replace old buses or to fund infrastructure to reduce diesel emissions. The settlement covers 475,000 2.0-liter diesel Jetta, Beetle, Audi A3, Golf, and Passat vehicles from the 2009-2015 model years. VW also announced a separate settlement with 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico that will cost at least $600 million, bringing the total to as much as $15.3 billion. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates said a criminal investigation remained active. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at multiple companies and multiple individuals,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBy duping regulators, Volkswagen turned nearly half a million American drivers into unwitting accomplices in an unprecedented assault on our environment,‚Äù she added. The EPA is investigating other automakers for potential emissions problems. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the agency ‚Äúwill be releasing information as it becomes available.‚Äù VW still faces criminal investigations in Germany and other countries, and lawsuits from investors around the world. The company planned a multi-billion-euro investment program to introduce more than 30 fully electric cars by 2025. Owners have until late 2018 to decide whether to sell the vehicles back.  The deals would move VW close to the 16.2 billion euros ($18 billion) it has set aside to cover costs of the scandal. But spending on buybacks could be much less if regulators approve fixes and owners opt for repairs. Most owners will get $5,100 to $10,000 in compensation, including the pre-scandal value of the cars, documents filed on Tuesday said. The company expects to begin buying back vehicles in October, when a U.S. judge is expected to give final approval to the settlements, and is to start proposing fixes in November.  VW cannot resell or export vehicles it buys back unless the EPA approves a fix, the documents said. Volkswagen must repair or buy back 85 percent of the 475,000 vehicles by June 2019 or face penalties of $100 million for every percentage point below that figure. The agreement does not lift a ban on sales by VW of its U.S. 2016 diesel vehicles. Nor does it cover fees for lawyers of owners suing the company or address 80,000 larger polluting 3.0 liter Porsche, Audi and VW diesel cars.  VW could also face billions in additional costs if it is forced to buy back the 3.0 liter vehicles. VW will likely face significant yet-to-be determined fines under the U.S. Clean Air Act for emissions violations. The settlement does not resolve lawsuits filed last year by owners against German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH, which was accused of conspiring with Volkswagen to evade emissions standards.

Important to look at individuals in VW scandal: Lynch,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Tuesday that it was important for the Justice Department to look at individuals in the ongoing criminal investigation into the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal.

Exclusive: Trump supporters more likely to view blacks negatively - Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Supporters of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump are more likely to describe African Americans as ‚Äúcriminal,‚Äù ‚Äúunintelligent,‚Äù ‚Äúlazy‚Äù and ‚Äúviolent‚Äù than voters who backed some Republican rivals in the primaries or who support Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Ahead of the Nov. 8 election to replace Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, the poll also showed significant numbers of Americans in both the Republican and Democratic parties view blacks more negatively than whites, harbor anxiety about living in diverse neighborhoods and are concerned that affirmative action policies discriminate against whites. Republicans in the survey expressed these concerns to a greater degree than Democrats, with Trump supporters presenting the most critical views of blacks. The poll, conducted between March and June, interviewed 16,000 Americans and included 21 questions on attitudes about race. It sought responses from voters who support Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and her rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. It also surveyed supporters of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, the last two Republican candidates to drop out of the race. ‚ÄúMr. Trump is an egalitarian who believes in supporting and protecting all people equally,‚Äù said Stephen Miller, Trump‚Äôs senior policy adviser, when asked about the poll.¬†‚ÄúThis is a stark contrast to Hillary Clinton, whose policies have been a disaster for African-American and Hispanic citizens.‚Äù A spokesman for Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the poll. (Graphic on racial attitudes of presidential candidates' supporters tmsnrt.rs/294chjP) Nearly half of Trump‚Äôs supporters described African Americans as more ‚Äúviolent‚Äù than whites. The same proportion described African Americans as more ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù than whites, while 40 percent described them as more ‚Äúlazy‚Äù than whites. In smaller, but still significant, numbers, Clinton backers also viewed blacks more critically than whites with regard to certain personality traits. Nearly one-third of Clinton supporters described blacks as more ‚Äúviolent‚Äù and ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù than whites, and one-quarter described them as more ‚Äúlazy‚Äù than whites. Clinton is relying heavily on black voters to help her win the White House, and her victory over Sanders in the early state nominating contests was due in part to her overwhelming lead among African Americans. When asked about where they wanted to live, 36 percent of Trump supporters said, ‚ÄúI prefer to live in a community with people who come from diverse cultures,‚Äù compared with 46 percent of Cruz supporters, 55 percent of Kasich supporters and 70 percent of Clinton supporters. Trump‚Äôs supporters were more likely to be critical of affirmative action policies that favor minorities in school admissions or in hiring. Some 31 percent of Trump supporters said they ‚Äústrongly agree‚Äù that ‚Äúsocial policies, such as affirmative action, discriminate unfairly against white people,‚Äù compared with 21 percent of Cruz supporters, 17 percent of Kasich supporters and 16 percent of Clinton supporters. To be sure, not all Trump supporters expressed negative attitudes about blacks. No more than 50 percent of his supporters rated blacks negatively, relative to whites, on any of the six character traits in the poll. Yet when their answers to the poll questions were compared with responses from supporters of other candidates, Trump supporters were always more critical of blacks on personality traits, analysis of the results showed.  The trend was consistent in the data, even when the results were filtered to include only white respondents to remove any impact that a different racial mix between Clinton and Trump supporters might play in the poll. The Trump supporters‚Äô views on affirmative action and neighborhood diversity do not necessarily reflect racial bias alone, said¬†Michael Traugott, a polling expert and professor emeritus at the University of Michigan, who is not publicly supporting either Trump or Clinton. Rather, the results could also suggest anxieties about economic insecurity and social standing.  Trump, whose supporters are mostly white, has promised to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, crack down on illegal immigration and pull out of global trade deals that he says have hurt American workers.  ‚ÄúThe support for Trump is indicative of the support for the type of policies he is advocating,‚Äù said Lawrence Brown, a professor at Morgan State University in Baltimore who writes about racism and has supported Sanders. Obama said in May that U.S. race relations have improved over the last three decades but that significant work still needs to be done.  The issue of race has assumed great political prominence over the past two years, amid countrywide protests over police treatment of African Americans, economic disparity between blacks and whites, and court challenges to affirmative action and voting rights. The Reuters/Ipsos poll asked people to grade whites and blacks on a series of personal traits. The results were then analyzed to compare how each respondent rated whites with how they rated blacks. In nearly every case, Trump supporters were more likely to rate whites higher than blacks when their responses were compared with responses from Clinton supporters.  For example, 32 percent of Trump supporters placed whites closer to the top level of ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù than they did blacks, compared with 22 percent of Clinton supporters who did the same. About 40 percent of Trump supporters placed whites higher on the ‚Äúhardworking‚Äù scale than blacks, while 25 percent of Clinton supporters did the same. And 44 percent of Trump supporters placed whites as more ‚Äúwell mannered‚Äù than blacks, compared with 30 percent of Clinton supporters. The online poll, which surveyed people over the age of 18 across the United States, was conducted during two periods in the 2016 election cycle. The first ran three weeks in March and April, while Cruz and Kasich were still competing with Trump for the Republican nomination. The second polling period covered nearly four weeks in May and June, after Kasich and Cruz had dropped out. ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 "
"Trump vows to reopen, or toss, NAFTA pact with Canada and Mexico","MONESSEN, Pennsylvania/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday vowed to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate the NAFTA trade agreement with the United States if elected, as part of an effort to protect and restore American jobs. Trump criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement as a U.S. job killer, saying he would be willing to scrap the pact if Canada and Mexico were unwilling to budge. He also tried to link Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to the deal on the eve of a meeting in Ottawa of the ‚Äúthree amigos,‚Äù the leaders of the three NAFTA signatories: the United States, Mexico and Canada.  In his most detailed speech on trade, the presumptive Republican nominee said he would pull the United States out of negotiations for a deal among 12 Pacific Rim nations and promised to use executive power to resolve trade disputes with China. Trump also pledged to revive the U.S. steel and aluminum industry, speaking at an aluminum scrap company in Monessen, Pennsylvania, nearly 30 miles (50 km) south of Pittsburgh, the one-time American steelmaking capital. Trump has identified Pennsylvania as a state he believes he can wrest from the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election. He also campaigned on Tuesday in Ohio, which like Pennsylvania is a Rust Belt state.  Democratic President Barack Obama won both states in 2008 and 2012, but manufacturing job losses have led to voter anxiety in the region. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. And I don‚Äôt mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better,‚Äù Trump said in Pennsylvania. If Canada and Mexico do not agree to renegotiate the pact, Trump said he would notify them under the agreement‚Äôs terms ‚Äúthat America intends to withdraw from the deal.‚Äù He tried to tie his Democratic rival to the pact, approved in 1993 during the administration of her husband, President Bill Clinton, as he called NAFTA one of the ‚Äúworst legacies‚Äù of the Clinton years. On MSNBC after Trump‚Äôs speech, Clinton spokeswoman Kristina Schake called the wealthy New York businessman the ‚Äúking of outsourcing,‚Äù in an apparent reference to Trump-branded products such as suits and ties made overseas.  ‚ÄúIt was full of hypocrisy and misstatements and outright lies,‚Äù Schake said. Trade has been a vulnerability for Clinton, who struggled for white, blue-collar votes in her Democratic primary race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who criticized her for supporting trade deals and said she was too close to Wall Street.   TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP Trump echoed Sanders‚Äô criticism on Tuesday, saying Clinton supported the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, while she was secretary of state and only opposed it once she was running for president. Clinton‚Äôs campaign said she opposed the agreement because it was not strong enough on currency manipulation and other areas.        Clinton has said she will evaluate each trade deal on its merits but does not believe the TPP is good for U.S. workers.        Sanders now says he will vote for Clinton in November, although he has not formally withdrawn from the race. Trump said he saw no way to fix the TPP, calling it a ‚Äúdeath blow‚Äù for American manufacturing. Although China is not part of the agreement, Trump said Beijing might try to enter it ‚Äúthrough the back door‚Äù later on. Later, during a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Trump said the deal was ‚Äújust a continuing rape of our country.‚Äù Just hours before Trump spoke, Clinton allies sought to pre-empt the planned trade speech by saying Trump‚Äôs policies amounted to empty promises. Earlier, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told a trade conference in Washington that ‚ÄúTrump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policy. He has consistently sent American jobs overseas to line his own pockets.‚Äù The AFL-CIO, which collectively represents more than 12 million workers, making it the largest U.S. labor federation, endorsed Clinton this month. Both Clinton and Trump have acknowledged that Britain‚Äôs vote to leave the European Union signaled a global economic frustration among working-class voters that could reverberate in the U.S. election. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of legitimate anxiety, fear and even anger in many parts of our country because people feel like the economy has failed them,‚Äù Clinton said in Denver on Tuesday. ‚ÄúI think this is going to be one of the defining issues in this election.‚Äù Trump has seized on the historic Brexit vote to bolster his argument that voters are rising up against establishment leaders, saying Americans would reject the ‚Äúglobal elite‚Äù and support his presidential candidacy. But Trump has broken with Republican Party orthodoxy in criticizing trade deals, and has threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports. His rhetoric has drawn criticism from many economists, who say such practices could spark trade wars. As Trump spoke, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is usually in sync with prominent Republicans on trade policy, said on Twitter: ‚ÄúUnder Trump‚Äôs trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 "

Justice Dept. reviewing Supreme Court immigration decision: Lynch,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - The Obama administration is looking into whether it can challenge the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to block President Barack Obama‚Äôs plan to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday.         ‚ÄúWe will be reviewing the case and seeing what, if anything else, we need to do in court,‚Äù Lynch told Reuters in an interview.  Lynch did not say what legal options the Obama administration may pursue following a split decision by the Supreme Court justices last week that left in place a block on the executive action by a lower court.  She said any future executive actions Obama may take on immigration would be left to the White House.  In a wideranging interview on topics from gun control to the effect of the planned exit of Britain from the European Union, Lynch identified espionage from foreign nationals on U.S. companies as a ‚Äútremendous problem.‚Äù The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported a 53 percent increase in cases of economic espionage between 2014 and 2015 and the majority of cases involve Chinese nationals as culprits.  Most recently, Xu Jiaqiang, 30, was charged with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets, for stealing software source code from his U.S. employer with the intent of benefiting the Chinese government.  ‚ÄúIt is a matter of priority for us,‚Äù Lynch said. ‚ÄúWhen companies or industries are preyed upon by others, be they individuals, be they state actors who literally steal the fruit of their intellectual labors, essentially they are stealing from future generations also.‚Äù Asked to comment on the impact of Britain‚Äôs decision at a referendum last week to leave the European Union, Lynch said the law enforcement relationships between the United States and both Britain and the European Union would remain strong.  ‚ÄúWe have very strong and positive relationship with law enforcement in the United Kingdom and, as of now, I do not see that changing in respect to the United Kingdom or the European Union,‚Äù Lynch said.  Asked about changes that should be made in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando on June 12, Lynch did not say if the Justice Department or the Obama administration was working on more executive actions on gun control but would continue research on ‚Äúsmart-gun‚Äù technology. A smart gun is one that can only be fired by the authorized user, often by requiring a palm print, in order to prevent gun theft or accidental shootings.      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be a longer-term project. One of the things that we want to make sure is that people who do own guns lawfully have a way to make sure that their family members are safe in the house with them,‚Äù Lynch said the Justice Department is looking to see if the federal government can move smart-gun research forward, including on technology that can be used by the military. Lynch also said that it was important for the Justice Department to look at individuals in the ongoing criminal investigation into the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal.

Clinton leads Trump by 11 points in U.S. presidential race: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton posted an 11 percentage point lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, a small decline since late last week. The June 24-28 poll showed that 45.3 percent of likely American voters support Clinton while 34.1 percent support Trump, and another 20.5 percent support neither. Clinton‚Äôs lead was 14 points on Friday, though she has generally been widening her advantage over the New York real estate magnate since mid-May, when the two were nearly tied. The former secretary of state, senator and first lady was bolstered in recent days by endorsements from members of the Republican establishment, including Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary under former President George W. Bush. Her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, said last week he would vote for her to stop Trump even though his campaign said this was not a formal endorsement. Clinton is struggling to win over Sanders supporters after a hard-fought campaign for the nomination. Critics have assailed her over her handling of emails and a 2012 attack on a U.S. mission in Libya while secretary of state. Trump got a brief boost in the days after the June 12 mass shooting in Florida, coming within nine points of Clinton as he fine-tuned a campaign promise to temporarily ban the entry of Muslim immigrants to shore up national security. His level of support so far in June, however, lags behind what his predecessor, Republican White House hopeful Mitt Romney, received in the same period in 2012.  He has sparred with Republican leaders over his off-the-cuff rhetoric and lagged behind Clinton‚Äôs campaign organization in both size and fundraising, worrying some of his allies.  The poll included 1,099 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 "
"Sanders back in U.S. Senate, blasts 'colonialism' in Puerto Rico","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders brought his firebrand rhetoric back to the floor of the Senate on Tuesday to condemn a White House-backed bill on Puerto Rico‚Äôs financial crisis as ‚Äúcolonialism at its worst.‚Äù Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who turned an unlikely presidential bid into a political movement to combat inequality, warned that legislation due for a crucial Senate vote on Wednesday would subject Puerto Rico to Republican trickle-down economics and favor ‚Äúvulture capitalists‚Äù at the expense of the island‚Äôs increasingly impoverished population. An aide said it was the first time Sanders has spoken in the Senate since December. ‚ÄúDoes that sound like the kind of morality that should be passed here in the United States Senate?‚Äù Sanders fumed during an eight-minute appearance to support an hours-long speech by Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who opposes the bill. The Vermont senator used his appearance to rail against details of the legislation, which would put much of Puerto Rico‚Äôs management in the hands of a seven-member oversight board and require the island to pay $370 million over five years for the board‚Äôs administration costs even as it cuts funding for education, healthcare and pensions. In an exchange with Menendez, Sanders said, ‚ÄúHow in God‚Äôs name do you run up an administrative cost of $370 million,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI know this sounds so absurd that people may think I‚Äôm misleading them.‚Äù ‚ÄúWould my friend from New Jersey agree that this is colonialism at its worst?‚Äù asked Sanders, who announced last week that he would vote for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in her November election contest against Republican Donald Trump. ‚ÄúOh absolutely,‚Äù replied Menendez. The Puerto Rico bill, which has already been passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, faces opposition from both sides of the aisle in the Senate. Nevertheless, the Obama administration and Republican leaders are trying to get the bill passed before a July 1 deadline, when the island is scheduled to make a $1.9 billion payment on its $70 billion debt.

Cruz chairs contentious U.S. Senate hearing on 'radical Islam',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz on Tuesday accused the Obama administration of under-emphasizing the ‚Äúthreat of radical Islam‚Äù as he presided over a Senate hearing for the second time since suspending his presidential campaign in early May. President Barack Obama and top Justice Department officials have come under fire from conservatives for avoiding the term ‚Äúradical Islam‚Äù when denouncing attacks by violent extremists who claim inspiration from Islamic State, such as the Orlando nightclub shooter.  Administration officials have countered that focusing on the use of the phrase is a political distraction and gives fuel to Islamic State propagandists who say the United States has waged war against all of Islam. Absent from Tuesday‚Äôs hearing before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee were the two top Justice Department counter-terrorism officials whom Cruz had invited to testify. ‚ÄúThe Obama administration of course has declined to appear and explain its policies,‚Äù Cruz said at the hearing, noting that the officials had not provided any reason for staying away. Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi said in an emailed statement that the department is ‚Äúfocused on aggressively and successfully pursuing terrorist adversaries‚Äù and on denying them ‚Äúunchallenged recruiting platforms to spread their messages of hate and intolerance.‚Äù Democratic members of the subcommittee said national security policies more targeted at Muslims, such as presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs call for a ban on Muslim immigrants, would be unconstitutional and counter-productive. ‚ÄúWe cannot fight radicalization with further radicalization,‚Äù said Democratic Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware, adding at the end of the hearing that he did not think ‚Äúarguing over semantics‚Äù for three hours had helped improve American national security. Experts from Muslim and Arab advocacy groups as well as former government national security officials testified at the hearing, representing both sides of the debate over whether the administration emphasizes Islam too much or too little in its counter-extremism policies. Protesters with Code Pink, an anti-war advocacy group, offered Cruz packs of gum labeled ‚ÄúIslamophobin‚Äù as he entered the hearing room, telling him it could cure Islamophobia.

Congressional watchdog expands probe of lax Wall Street oversight,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional watchdog said on Tuesday it has formally added three agencies to its investigation into whether government regulators are too soft on the banks they are meant to police. In March, Reuters exclusively reported that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) was preparing a probe of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other to-be-determined regulators, in response to a request by Democratic U.S. Representatives Maxine Waters and Al Green for it to look into ‚Äúregulatory capture.‚Äù  The review, requested last October, is the first by an outside agency into the perception that financial regulators are ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù by and too deferential toward the bankers they supervise, so that Wall Street benefits at the public‚Äôs expense. Lawrance Evans, director of the GAO‚Äôs financial markets and community investment division, said in an email on Tuesday that the probe would include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). The GAO will also look back at work by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which merged with the OCC in 2011, and regulates savings and loan institutions.  Evans said the investigation is technically separate from the probe of the Fed, ‚Äúbut it is indeed part of the work we are doing in response to the Waters/Green request.‚Äù  The FDIC declined to comment. Representatives from the OCC and NCUA were not immediately available to comment.

"U.S. official sees progress against Islamic State, war continuing","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs special envoy for the fight against Islamic State said on Tuesday that coalition forces were making progress and planning assaults on key cities in Iraq and Syria, but U.S. lawmakers criticized the progress as too slow. Brett McGurk testified at a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations hearing that morale is falling within the militant group as it loses territory. But he said efforts to find a political solution were making little progress and could not predict an end to fighting as long as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remained in power. ‚ÄúSo long as Assad is leading the government in Damascus there is no way this war will ever end,‚Äù McGurk said. The conflict between U.S.-backed armed groups and Assad‚Äôs government, supported by Russia and Iran, has complicated the fight against Islamic State amid a massive humanitarian crisis. Iraqi forces recently entered the Islamic State bastion of Falluja just west of Baghdad, and were pushing north toward Mosul, by far the biggest city that Islamic State controls. In Syria, U.S.-backed forces were closing in on the militant stronghold of Manbij, and Assad‚Äôs Russian-backed army has advanced into the province surrounding the de facto Islamic State capital Raqqa. McGurk said completion of the operation against Manbij would create conditions to move on Raqqa. And he said planning was under way for a campaign to liberate Mosul. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre beginning to totally isolate their presence in Raqqa and Mosul and I believe we are setting the conditions in place to get them out of both of these cities,‚Äù McGurk said. He offered no timeline for those operations. Lawmakers said they felt the campaign was moving too slowly, and worried that, without a political solution, defeating Islamic State would leave behind a power vacuum that could be filled by another militant group. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how what‚Äôs left of the political process possibly leads to Assad‚Äôs departure,‚Äù said Republican Senator Bob Corker, the committee‚Äôs chairman. A massacre two weeks ago in Florida by a gunman inspired by Islamic State drew attention to its efforts to inspire attacks in the west.   McGurk said Raqqa was the center for the group‚Äôs social media operations, which have become more of a focus as its fortunes have faded on the battlefield. Discussing the region, McGurk said Washington would like more air resources from coalition allies United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. ‚ÄúRight now we want to end the war in Yemen in order to really focus efforts on the counter-ISIL campaign,‚Äù McGurk said, using an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS.

U.S. lawmakers deadlock on Zika virus funds,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the Zika virus on Tuesday, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the mosquito-borne virus and hurt other health priorities. Amid political recriminations by both parties, the Republican plan to provide $1.1 billion in funding to combat Zika, which had already passed the House of Representatives, failed to get the 60 votes needed in the Senate to clear a procedural hurdle. The vote was 52 in favor and 48 against on a mostly party-line vote.  It was unclear when Congress would revisit the issue. Democrats urged bipartisan talks, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said lawmakers would address the matter again sometime after the July 4 national holiday next week. Both sides warned the other that there could be a political price to pay in an election year for stalling on Zika funding, with the summer mosquito season under way and with it the threat of the virus spreading. ‚ÄúHere we are, in an utterly absurd position, playing political games as this public health crisis mounts here in our country,‚Äù McConnell said. The Zika virus, which has swept through the Americas and Caribbean since last fall, has been linked to thousands of cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect, in Brazil, as well as to neurological disorders. It has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. There have not yet been any cases reported of local transmission of the Zika virus in the continental United States, but there have been 820 cases that were acquired from travel to areas with active Zika outbreaks, or through sexual transmission. There have been more than 1,800 cases of Zika infection reported in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory in the Caribbean. Health experts expect local transmission to occur in the continental United States with warmer weather. Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to Zika funding. The Republican plan would have funded mosquito control efforts by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as well as vaccine research by the National Institutes of Health, and money for community health centers in areas that are experiencing the highest rates of Zika transmission. But Democrats complained that Republicans locked them out of drafting the $1.1 billion funding plan, which would have made $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere. The Republican plan, rushed through the House last week, would have taken money from battling the Ebola virus as well as from funds set aside for implementing the Obamacare health insurance program in U.S. territories. The Senate last month agreed to a bipartisan bill allocating the same amount - $1.1 billion - to fight Zika, but without cutting any other programs. Democrats were especially angry that the Republican proposal that failed on Tuesday would not allow funding to go to private entities such as the women‚Äôs healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, although the Zika virus can be sexually transmitted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what universe (McConnell) is living in. What does he think, we‚Äôre all stupid, the American people are dumb? They‚Äôre not. They understand what‚Äôs going here,‚Äù Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid declared after the vote. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had vowed to veto the plan, which falls short of his $1.9 billion request, if it ever arrived on his desk. Republicans charged that the Democrats were blocking the measure mainly because it included no funding for Planned Parenthood, a non-profit group that Democrats and Republicans have been skirmishing over for years. It provides health exams, screening and contraception services to women. Republicans have previously sought to cut off all federal funding to the group, which also provides abortions. Planned Parenthood says abortions make up just three percent of its work. Republican Senator John Thune, referring to Planned Parenthood, charged on Monday that Democrats were more interested in pleasing a what he called a special interest group than in acting on Zika. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The WHO has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.

Republican Ryan wants trade talks with Britain,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, called on Tuesday for Washington, in parallel with its negotiations with Europe, to pursue a separate free trade agreement with Britain, once it has formally separated from the European Union. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican in the United States, echoed a call from many members of his party, who have dismissed President Barack Obama‚Äôs contention that Britain will be at the ‚Äúback of the queue‚Äù for trade talks. Obama issued that warning in April when he intervened to try to persuade Britons to vote to remain in the June 23 referendum on staying or leaving the EU.   Free trade agreements require the approval of both houses of the U.S. Congress. Ryan‚Äôs Republicans currently control a majority in both the House and Senate.  EU and U.S. negotiations had sought to conclude the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks before Obama leaves office in January. Although many of his fellow Democrats oppose trade deals as a potential threat to U.S. jobs, Obama has worked with Republicans to pass trade measures. ‚ÄúThat is something we should begin discussions with Great Britain to ease concerns so that we do have a smooth trade relationship with Great Britain because they are our indispensable ally,‚Äù Ryan said on WISN, a radio station in his home state Wisconsin. The remarks were distributed by Ryan‚Äôs office in Washington. Some trade experts have said that a deal on TTIP is unlikely for years now without Britain at the table, which could open an opportunity for a separate deal with Britain.

"For Obama, setbacks from a divided Supreme Court","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court breaks for the summer this week, having dealt high-profile setbacks to President Barack Obama on issues important to his liberal legacy, notably on immigration and climate change. This will be the high court‚Äôs last full nine-month term of the Democratic president‚Äôs administration. Obama leaves office in January 2017. The court was one shy of its full strength nine members much of this term due to the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13. His absence affected the outcome of some major cases. Four cases, including the immigration dispute, ended in 4-4 splits that left lower court rulings in place. There was little Obama could do about it. Even if the Republican-led U.S. Senate had accepted Obama‚Äôs March 16 nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia, it was unlikely he would have made it to the bench in time to hear the term‚Äôs final round of arguments in April. Hoping their candidate wins the presidential election in November, Republicans insist the choice of Scalia‚Äôs successor should fall to the next president. The administration did score some major wins on abortion and  other social issues, but these were when it intervened in cases where it was not directly involved. Obama‚Äôs biggest loss came last Thursday on his bid to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation. The 4-4 deadlock will keep him from taking major action on immigration reform, a top policy aim, before he leaves office. In a second major blow to Obama‚Äôs legacy, the court unexpectedly put on hold sweeping federal regulations meant to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, the centerpiece of his administration‚Äôs climate change strategy.. That decision by a 5-4 vote, days before Scalia‚Äôs death, effectively put off a ruling on the regulation until after a legal challenge is completed - sometime after the next president enters the White House - and prevented the new regulations from being implemented. On healthcare, the administration lost narrowly to Christian groups that sought an exemption to a provision of his signature law known as Obamacare requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraception.  The high court sent that dispute back to lower courts without deciding the main legal issue, throwing out a series of rulings in the government‚Äôs favor. The administration lost some other big cases in which it was directly involved, including former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell‚Äôs successful appeal of his corruption convictions. A silver lining for the administration came in cases where it lent its support, as a friend of the court, to advocates for abortion rights and for race-based university admissions to offset years of discrimination. Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal leaning Constitutional Accountability Center, said Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, the administration‚Äôs top Supreme Court lawyer until he stepped down last week, deserved some credit for the ruling on Monday striking down tough abortion restrictions in Texas due to his performance during the oral argument. Last Thursday, the court upheld consideration of race as an acceptable factor in admissions at the University of Texas. Had Scalia lived, the court might have deadlocked 4-4 in that too. One 4-4 decision went the administration‚Äôs way. The government supported unions that successfully fended off a conservative legal challenge. The divided court left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the unions. With Scalia on the court, the conservative majority would likely have struck down fees that many states force workers to pay unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other activities.  A loss for unions would have deprived unions representing teachers, police, transit workers, firefighters and other government employees of millions of dollars annually and diminished their political clout. The administration also scored a significant victory when the court upheld an electricity-markets regulation that encourages big power users like factories to cut consumption at peak times, rejecting a challenge brought by electric utilities.

"Supreme Court firmly backs abortion rights, tosses Texas law","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of abortion rights in America in more than two decades. The 5-3 ruling held that the Republican-backed 2013 Texas law placed an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy, established in the court‚Äôs landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The abortion providers who challenged the law said it was medically unnecessary and specifically intended to shut clinics.  Texas officials said it was intended to protect women‚Äôs health. The ruling means similar laws in other states are probably unconstitutional and could put in jeopardy other types of abortion restrictions enacted in various conservative states. ‚ÄúThe decision should send a loud signal to politicians that they can no longer hide behind sham rationales to shut down clinics and prevent a woman who has decided to end a pregnancy from getting the care she needs,‚Äù said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. President Barack Obama, whose administration backed the abortion providers in the court challenge, said in a statement he was ‚Äúpleased to see the Supreme Court protect women‚Äôs rights and health‚Äù and that restrictions like those in Texas ‚Äúharm women‚Äôs health and place an unconstitutional obstacle in the path of a woman‚Äôs reproductive freedom.‚Äù Conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the court‚Äôs four liberal members in the ruling, with the remaining three conservatives dissenting. The court declared that both key provisions of the law - requiring abortion doctors to have  difficult-to-obtain ‚Äúadmitting privileges‚Äù at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities - violated a woman‚Äôs right to an abortion. Writing for the court, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said, ‚ÄúWe conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes.‚Äù ‚ÄúEach places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre-viability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution,‚Äù Breyer added. Deferring to state legislatures over ‚Äúquestions of medical uncertainty is also inconsistent with this court‚Äôs case law,‚Äù Breyer added. The ruling in the case, Whole Woman‚Äôs Health v. Hellerstedt, represented the most vigorous affirmation of abortion rights in the United States since a 1992 ruling affirmed a woman‚Äôs right to have the procedure. On a warm sunny summer day, hundreds of people on both sides of the issue converged on the Supreme Court building, with abortion rights advocates dancing and celebrating after the ruling. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ecstatic. The reality is today women won,‚Äù abortion rights activist Marcela Howell said. The law was passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013. Ten states currently have admitting privileges requirements on the books while six have laws requiring hospital-grade facilities. Lower courts have blocked admitting privileges provisions in five states and halted facilities regulations in two states.  ‚ÄúThe decision erodes states‚Äô lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women and subjects more innocent life to being lost. Texas‚Äô goal is to protect innocent life, while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women,‚Äù Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott said. Since the law was passed, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people, had dropped from 41 to 19. The Supreme Court has appeals pending in two cases involving admitting privilege laws in Mississippi and Wisconsin on which it could act as soon as Tuesday. ¬†¬†¬† The Texas law required abortion doctors to have ‚Äúadmitting privileges,‚Äù a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic so they can treat patients needing surgery or other critical care. The law also required clinic buildings to possess costly, hospital-grade facilities. These regulations covered numerous building features such as corridor width, the swinging motion of doors, floor tiles, parking spaces, elevator size, ventilation, electrical wiring, plumbing, floor tiling and even the angle that water flows from drinking fountains. Americans remain closely divided over whether abortion should be legal. In a Reuters/Ipsos online poll involving 6,769 U.S. adults conducted from June 3 to June 22, 47 percent of respondents said abortion generally should be legal and 42 percent said it generally should be illegal. Views on abortion in the United States have changed very little over the decades, according to historical polling data. The last time the justices decided a major abortion case was nine years ago when they ruled 5-4 to uphold a federal law banning a late-term abortion procedure. Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman‚Äôs Health, which led the challenge to the Texas law, said, ‚ÄúEvery day Whole Woman‚Äôs Health treats our patients with compassion, respect and dignity - and today the Supreme Court did the same. We‚Äôre thrilled that today justice was served and our clinics stay open.‚Äù Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Twitter called the ruling ‚Äúa victory for women in Texas and across America.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis fight isn‚Äôt over: The next president has to protect women‚Äôs health. Women won‚Äôt be ‚Äòpunished‚Äô for exercising their basic rights,‚Äù she said, a dig at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who once suggested women who get illegal abortions should face ‚Äúsome sort of punishment.‚Äù The presidential election is Nov. 8. Some U.S. states have pursued a variety of restrictions on abortion, including banning certain types of procedures, prohibiting it after a certain number of weeks of gestation, requiring parental permission for girls until a certain age, imposing waiting periods or mandatory counseling, and others. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exceedingly unfortunate that the court has taken the ability to protect women‚Äôs health out of the hands of Texas citizens and their duly-elected representatives,‚Äù Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito dissented. The normally nine-justice court was one member short after the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who consistently opposed abortion in past rulings.

Abortion providers aim to reopen some closed Texas clinics,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Abortion providers in Texas reacted with surprise and elation on Monday to the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to throw out the state‚Äôs restrictive abortion law and said they aimed to reopen some clinics shut down since the measure was passed in 2013. Since the law was passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people, has fallen from 41 to 19. ‚ÄúI am honestly surprised by the Supreme Court decision,‚Äù Rachel Bergstrom-Carlson,¬†health center manager at Planned Parenthood of Austin, said at the clinic that performs about 250 abortions per month in the Texas state capital. But Bergstrom-Carlson said she does not think the ruling ‚Äúall of the sudden creates open access‚Äù to abortion for Texas women or that it means other legislation intended to restrict women‚Äôs access to safe and legal abortions will be scrapped. Abortion providers said the law imposed medically unnecessary regulations that were intended to shut clinics. Texas state officials said the law was aimed at protecting women‚Äôs health. Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who performs abortions at Whole Woman‚Äôs Health clinics in Texas, said abortion providers will seek to reopen some of the shuttered clinics but do not expect to be able to return to the number in operation prior to the law. Negotiating new leases and hiring staff will mean a slow return to operations for those that do re-open, Kumar said. The Supreme Court ruled that both key provisions of the law - requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain ‚Äúadmitting privileges‚Äù at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities - violated a woman‚Äôs right to an abortion established in a 1973 landmark ruling. ‚ÄúI am beyond elated,‚Äù Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman‚Äôs Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas and spearheaded the challenge to the law. ‚ÄúAfter years of fighting heartless, anti-abortion Texas politicians who would seemingly stop at nothing to push abortion out of reach, I want everyone to understand: you don‚Äôt mess with Texas, you don‚Äôt mess with Whole Woman‚Äôs Health,‚Äù she added. If the Supreme Court had left the law in place, only eight clinics would have remained open, including the Planned Parenthood facility in Austin, a U.S. lower court judge said. The state‚Äôs Republican leaders, including the governor and attorney general, criticized the ruling that they said would endanger public health. ‚ÄúNow abortion clinics are free to ignore these basic safety standards and continue practicing under substandard conditions,‚Äù Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said.¬†‚ÄúBy its ruling, the court held that the ability of abortion clinics to remain open ‚Äì even under substandard conditions ‚Äì outweighs the state‚Äôs ability to put women‚Äôs health and safety first.‚Äù The legislature meets again next year, and top lawmakers indicated they may look at new abortion restrictions. The ‚Äúadmitting privileges‚Äù provision, requiring doctors who perform abortions to have formal affiliation with a hospital within 30 miles (48 kms) of their clinic, had gone into effect. The facilities standards had been put on hold by courts. ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 "
Court decision shifts abortion battle to state bans,"(Reuters) - The battle over abortion was expected to shift to measures focusing on the fetus in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs decision striking down a Texas law enacted in the name of maternal health. The 5-3 ruling held that Texas clinic regulations put an undue burden on women seeking abortion, a right established in the court‚Äôs landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The ruling could affect similar laws in more than a dozen states and stands as the biggest affirmation of abortion rights in more than two decades.  Opponents said they would regroup, turning their attention to defending and expanding laws that ban abortion after 20 weeks gestation or sooner. But this path could be difficult as well. The Supreme Court has not taken up any outright ban on abortion tied to fetal gestation in decades and has repeatedly rejected pleas by states to endorse such laws. ‚ÄúWe believe that, even before today, these laws were very likely to be struck down because they are unconstitutional bans on abortion,‚Äù said Emily J. Martin, general counsel for the National Women‚Äôs Law Center. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs decision only strengthens that conclusion.‚Äù Abortion opponents acknowledged the defeat but vowed to press on. ‚ÄúThe pro-life movement takes two steps forward and, occasionally, a step backward,‚Äù said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee. More than a dozen states now have provisions banning abortions after 20 weeks, ‚Äúand, and we are going to be pushing that,‚Äù Tobias said. Nebraska enacted the first 20-week ban in 2010. Since then, similar laws have been adopted in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion rights. Mississippi‚Äôs law bans abortion after just 18 weeks. Abortion opponents said they also planned to step up efforts encouraging states to limit second term abortions through bans on the use of dilation and extraction method. Nine of 10 abortions in the United States are performed in the first trimester. But the dilation and extraction method is the most common procedure used for second trimester abortions. Kansas and Oklahoma adopted bans on the procedure last year, but those laws have been blocked by courts. West Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana passed laws this year; none has yet to draw challenge. The Supreme Court has turned away state efforts to revive bans struck down by lower courts. Earlier this year, it rejected Arkansas‚Äô bid to revive a ban on abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.  The Supreme Court turned away North Dakota‚Äôs effort to revive a law that banned most abortions once a fetal heartbeat could be detected, as early as six weeks after conception. And, in 2014, it declined to hear Arizona‚Äôs appeal of a lower-court ruling invalidating a ban on the procedure at 20 weeks. Before Monday, the last time the court had taken up an abortion rights case was in the 2007 dispute over a federal ban on a procedure critics call ‚Äúpartial birth abortion.‚Äù The procedure, known medically as ‚Äúintact dilation and extraction,‚Äù involves a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it. By a 5-4 vote, the court upheld the procedure. Writing the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy referred to moral issues and Congress‚Äôs findings that the procedure would not be necessary for the health of the mother. In Monday‚Äôs case, Kennedy joined the majority decision that the Texas law lacks the medical benefits to justify the burden it places on women‚Äôs access to abortion.

Jack Lew urges Senate to act on Puerto Rico debt,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday called on the Senate to take immediate action this week to address Puerto Rico‚Äôs $70 billion debt crisis before the critical July 1 deadline for the island territory‚Äôs next debt payments. ‚ÄúThe Senate should take up the matter immediately,‚Äù Lew said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ‚ÄúDelay will only jeopardize the ability of Congress to conclude its work before July 1, a critical deadline Puerto Rico‚Äôs leadership has publicly highlighted for months.‚Äù If no action is taken, the crisis there will only ratchet higher, he said in the letter. Puerto Rico faces a deadline on Friday to pay off $2 billion of its debts. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said later in a floor speech that the vote would take place on Wednesday. ‚ÄúI really do think that we can go ahead and support the bill,‚Äù he said.  A senior Republican aide could not confirm that a vote would take place on Wednesday.    The financially ailing island is staring down $70 billion worth of debt that it says it cannot repay in full, adding to its 45 percent poverty rate and rising emigration to the U.S. mainland that is also cutting into its economic growth. The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives already passed legislation to address Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt before leaving Washington for the July 4 holiday break. The Senate is expected to recess at the end of this week. The House bill, a rare piece of bipartisan legislation,  would establish a federal oversight board to negotiate various debt restructurings while seeking to institute balanced budgets on the island, a U.S. territory with 3.5 million residents. Lew called on senators to also pass the House measure - the ‚ÄúPuerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act,‚Äù or PROMESA - this week to get it to President Barack Obama to sign into law before Friday‚Äôs payment deadline. The Senate, also controlled by Republicans, is expected to debate the measure this week, but Democrats have said they want changes - a move that could complicate its passage. A vote is expected this week. ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 "
Senate set to begin debate on Puerto Rico debt relief bill,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - After months of waiting for the U.S. Congress to act as Puerto Rico‚Äôs economic crisis progressively worsened, the Caribbean island is on the verge of securing a relief plan from Washington aimed at helping it address a hobbling $70 billion debt. The Senate is set to launch a debate on Wednesday for legislation establishing a federal oversight board that would be in charge of restructuring the U.S. territory‚Äôs debt where one out of every three dollars it earns in revenue is used to pay creditors, according to the U.S. Treasury. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to let Puerto Rico go off the cliff here. It‚Äôs too important,‚Äù said Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. The measure is identical to the plan passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month, as Congress tries to send it to President Barack Obama to sign into law by July 1. That is when Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make a $1.9 billion payment.  As early as Wednesday, the Senate could cast a procedural vote on the bill that, if successful, would clear the measure for passage this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also took steps to limit amendments that can be offered to the bill. Some Democrats have complained about the makeup and operation of the oversight board that would be appointed by Washington as well as provisions demanded by House Republicans that potentially could lower minimum wages for some younger workers. ‚ÄúSomething needs to be done. We would really love some amendments on key issues like the composition of the board, the procedures for taking Puerto Rico into the bankruptcy court, and then especially, the labor provisions on overtime and minimum wage,‚Äù Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia told reporters. But any amendments would delay Congress‚Äô work on the bill and make it impossible to get to Obama before July 1, as the House of Representatives would have to sign off and it is in recess until July 5, after the Independence Day holiday weekend. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew reiterated his call for the Senate to pass the bill on Monday, saying if nothing is done by the Friday deadline, the debt crisis will only ratchet higher. Puerto Rico is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, a steady flow of outward migration to the U.S. mainland that further shrinks its tax base and the shuttering of essential services. If Congress does not pass the ‚ÄúPuerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act,‚Äù or PROMESA, before July 1, the island could default on all or part of the debt payment, including General Obligation bonds that are senior to all credits. ‚ÄúThe Senate should take up the matter immediately,‚Äù Lew said in a letter to McConnell. ‚ÄúDelay will only jeopardize the ability of Congress to conclude its work before July 1, a critical deadline Puerto Rico‚Äôs leadership has publicly highlighted for months.‚Äù While Puerto Ricans want some sort of relief from the debt their government is saddled with, many of the 3.5 million residents, who are U.S. citizens, nonetheless worry that the proposed seven-member oversight board will trample on San Juan‚Äôs self-governing rights. ‚ÄúThe bill is not perfect. I do not like the board. I do not like that it doesn‚Äôt add a mechanism to make our economy grow, but what is the alternative right now? That is why I call on the Senate to vote for this bill,‚Äù Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said during a panel discussion last week in Washington. Without PROMESA, an existing trickle of lawsuits could turn into a flood. In April when there was little sign of congressional action, Puerto Rico‚Äôs legislature passed a local debt moratorium law giving Garcia Padilla the authority to withhold debt payments. Investors on June 21 filed a lawsuit in U.S. federal court calling the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Rehabilitation Act illegal. ‚ÄúWe are at the mercy of the judge,‚Äù Garcia Padilla said during the panel discussion. PROMESA, if signed into law, puts an immediate stay, or hold, on any future lawsuits and is retroactive to December 2015. The stay remains in effect until the debt has been restructured to a sustainable level with the goal being an orderly restructuring an sustainable amount of debt. ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 "
"U.S. senator, opposing FBI email data grabs, places hold on spy bill","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic senator on Monday prevented legislation from being quickly considered that would expand the FBI‚Äôs power to use secretive surveillance orders to obtain some Internet records, arguing it would lead to a ‚Äúdramatic erosion‚Äù of U.S. privacy rights.   Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon placed a hold on the annual Intelligence Authorization Act, which grants congressional approval for clandestine operations carried out by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies. A provision of the authorization bill would allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use national security letters, which do not require a warrant, to compel companies such as Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google and Facebook to hand over certain Internet records. These would include email metadata, some browsing history and social media log-in information. Such an expansion would allow the FBI to retrieve sensitive data of U.S. citizens without court approval, Wyden said.  ‚ÄúConvenience alone does not justify such a dramatic erosion of Americans‚Äô constitutional rights,‚Äù he said on the Senate floor. National security letters are the latest flashpoint in a years-long debate pitting U.S. surveillance operations against digital privacy interests. Wyden‚Äôs objection blocks the Senate from rapidly advancing the bill and now forces Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell to go through normal order to hold a roll call vote, a process that can take days. Currently, national security letters, or NSLs, can only compel sharing of phone billing records, according to a 2008 legal memo written by the U.S. Justice Department. Still, the FBI has used the letters since then to request Internet records during national security investigations. Senate Republicans have attempted to advance the NSL expansion, which FBI Director James Comey has called his top legislative priority, several times in recent months. Last week the Senate came two votes short of advancing separate legislation that would have expanded national security letters. [uL1N19E0ZY] Though some Republicans invoked the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando earlier this month to promote that measure, Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said last week it was ‚Äúone hundred percent correct‚Äù that it would not have prevented the massacre. Wyden also said he opposed another provision of the authorization bill that would limit the jurisdiction of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government advisory committee that reviews the legality and effectiveness U.S. surveillance programs.

Only one-in-four Canadians support NAFTA ahead of 'Three Amigos' meet,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Only one-in-four Canadians say the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is good for their country, and more than one-third want it renegotiated, according to polling results released ahead of a¬†North American leaders‚Äô Summit on¬†Wednesday. The survey from the Angus Reid Institute on Monday come as protectionist sentiment swells in the United States, where voters at both ends of the political spectrum question the economic benefits of NAFTA. The U.S. Congress is hesitating to ratify a new 12-nation trade pact,¬†the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which¬†also¬†includes Canada and Mexico. Trade has long been a focus at the so-called¬†‚ÄúThree Amigos‚Äù summits between NAFTA members,¬†Canada, the United States and Mexico,¬†held this year in Ottawa. The matter has also¬†become a lightning rod issue in the election campaign to replace¬†U.S. President Barack Obama, who wants Congress to ratify TPP before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Republican Donald Trump, his party‚Äôs presumptive nominee for 2016, has attacked the TPP and describes¬†NAFTA¬†as a disaster that needs to be renegotiated or shelved.¬†Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has also said she opposes the TPP. Angus Reid Institute‚Äôs poll showed also one-quarter of Canadians feel NAFTA hurts the country, while half were either unsure or feel the deal has had no impact either way.  The institute‚Äôs executive director, Shachi Kurl, said the survey contrasts with past polls on other trade deals, in which Canadians were more likely to support than oppose them.  ‚ÄúIs this simply a gap in policy makers‚Äô adequately convincing Canadians that this has been a good deal?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIs NAFTA an exception in that Canadians see the specific trade deal as a bad deal? These are questions that we have to think on.‚Äù Kurl added the poll raises the question of whether Canadians are concerned about the effects of NAFTA in itself or whether their opinion is part of the global ‚Äúgrumpy view‚Äù on trade, citing U.S. anti-free-trade sentiments. Angus Reid¬†said it¬†conducted¬†the¬†online survey¬†with¬†a representative sample of 1,519 Canadian adults who are¬†its¬†members.

"Adios, Three Amigos: Obama heads to last summit with Canada, Mexico","WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will meet with the leaders of Canada and Mexico on Wednesday for his final ‚ÄúThree Amigos‚Äù summit, a meeting that may signal how keen the North American partners are to tout trade at a time of rising protectionist sentiment. The Ottawa summit comes on the heels of Britain voting to leave the European Union after more than 40 years. It also falls ahead of a U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8 where presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has made stagnant wages and U.S. manufacturing job losses focal points of his insurgent campaign. The so-called Brexit vote is bound to be an important theme for Obama‚Äôs meetings with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canada‚Äôs Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canada had negotiated a trade deal with the EU that is slated to take effect next year. The Brexit may delay its ratification and hurt Canada‚Äôs commodity-driven economy. The referendum results are also seen as a setback to talks on a U.S.-EU trade deal. Mexico, which already has a trade deal with the EU, has prepared a draft proposal for a pact with the United Kingdom. At the summit, leaders will also look at how best to foster trade with each other, said Mexico‚Äôs Finance Minister Luis Videgaray. ‚ÄúOne of the important issues, without doubt, is how to give a fresh impulse and greater value to North American integration,‚Äù Videgaray said. All three are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade deal that Obama had cast as an update of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He wants to finalize the TPP as part of his economic legacy in Asia. The TPP has become a target of both the left and the right in the U.S. election, and Congress has so far been unenthusiastic about ratifying the deal. The United States is the top export market for both Canada and Mexico. In 2015, U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico totaled $663 billion and $584 billion, respectively. But in Canada, only one in four people say the 22-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is good for the country, a poll released on Monday showed. The long-running Canada-U.S. battle over softwood lumber seems more likely than not to resume as early as October. Given all the controversy over trade, the leaders may decide to try to focus their summit talking points on other topics. ‚ÄúI expect them to try and stay away from it,‚Äù said Carlo Dade, director of the Canada West Foundation‚Äôs Center for Trade and Investment Policy. Ahead of the summit, the White House revealed that the leaders would commit to a new regional goal of 50 percent of power coming from clean energy by 2025, up from about 37 percent in 2015. The three countries also plan to unveil a plan to fight heroin production. At a joint press conference, the leaders are likely to field questions about the upcoming U.S. election and its implications for both Canada and Mexico. It will also be Obama‚Äôs first chance on an international stage to promote his recent endorsement of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state. In March, Pena Nieto roundly condemned Trump, who has promised to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and has complained about what he calls unfair trade. Mexico also named a new ambassador to aggressively promote its contributions to the U.S. economy. On Canada, Trump has so far been mostly silent.  ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean Canadians don‚Äôt feel the sting‚Äù of his protectionist ideas, said Chris Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs School of Advanced International Studies. Trudeau is likely to tread carefully so as to not endanger relations with a potential president. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unlikely there will be any formal discussion of Trump, who of course is the elephant in the room. In some ways, it‚Äôs better if there isn‚Äôt,‚Äù said one official involved in the summit. ‚ÄúThe message the leaders will be sending is eloquent enough - the three nations are closely integrated and cooperate well and that‚Äôs how the relationship should work,‚Äù the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. On trade, Pena Nieto and Trudeau are also cognizant that talk is cheap on the campaign trail. ‚ÄúI have to tell my Canadian friends this often - it doesn‚Äôt mean it will be the agenda once you get to the White House,‚Äù said David Wilkins, the U.S. ambassador to Canada from 2005-09 during the George W. Bush administration. Obama provides a good case in point.  In his 2008 presidential campaign, he demonized NAFTA, but once in office, he began working on the TPP, a deal he has said would fix his concerns about NAFTA. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs very much a ‚ÄòKeep calm and carry on‚Äô approach and we‚Äôre going to ignore some of the domestic politicking and see what happens when it happens,‚Äù said a Canadian source familiar with the summit talks.

"In campaign trail debut with Clinton, Warren says Trump driven by greed","CINCINNATI (Reuters) - Liberal Elizabeth Warren attacked Republican Donald Trump on Monday during her first campaign appearance with U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, calling him an ‚Äúinsecure money grubber‚Äù who is driven by greed and hate.  Warren, a leader of the Democratic Party‚Äôs progressive wing and a potential vice presidential pick, said Clinton had spent her career fighting for liberal values while Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, was focused on boosting his bottom line. The U.S. senator from Massachusetts appeared with Clinton before a raucous, enthusiastic crowd in Cincinnati, Ohio, targeting a battleground state in a potential preview of a Clinton-Warren campaign team. She repeatedly accused Trump of looking out for himself instead of for average Americans. ‚ÄúWhen Donald Trump says he‚Äôll make America great, he means make it even greater for rich guys just like Donald Trump,‚Äù Warren said, standing shoulder to shoulder with a cheering Clinton. Clinton has struggled to win over some liberal backers of rival Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont, since beating him for the Democratic nomination this month. She hopes the support of Warren can help her in that effort as she campaigns against Trump for the Nov. 8 election. Warren, who has vigorously attacked Trump in recent weeks, called him ‚Äúa small, insecure money grubber who fights for no one but himself‚Äù and warned: ‚ÄúHe will crush you into the dirt to get whatever he wants. That‚Äôs who he is.‚Äù The capacity crowd repeatedly roared its approval, and a line of supporters who could not get inside stretched out the door and down the street. At one point, Warren stopped her speech to turn and applaud Clinton, a former secretary of state. ‚ÄúShe knows what it takes to beat a thin-skinned bully who is driven by greed and hate,‚Äù said Warren, known for calling for reining in Wall Street and eradicating income inequality. WARREN ‚ÄòA SELLOUT‚Äô - TRUMP In a statement, Trump called Warren ‚Äúa sellout‚Äù for backing Clinton, who has taken donations from Wall Street interests and once backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Asian trade deal. Clinton has since reversed her trade stance. In an interview with NBC News, Trump called Warren ‚Äúa fraud‚Äù and ‚Äúa racist,‚Äù accusing her of making up claims about her Native American heritage to advance her career. He again called Warren ‚ÄúPocahontas,‚Äù the name of a 17th-century Native American figure, to draw attention to a controversy first raised during Warren‚Äôs 2012 Senate race in Massachusetts. ‚ÄúShe is one of the least productive senators in the United States Senate,‚Äù Trump told NBC. ‚ÄúWe call her Pocahontas for a reason.‚Äù Two other potential Clinton vice presidential picks - U.S. senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio - rejected Trump‚Äôs assertion and defended Warren‚Äôs record. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what he does, he attacks people. He acts like he‚Äôs attacking their character - he‚Äôs attacking his own character when he does that,‚Äù Brown told Reuters. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt believe anything Donald Trump says. Period,‚Äù Kaine told Reuters. Taking the microphone in Ohio, Clinton said she liked Warren‚Äôs aggressive approach to her Republican rival, who has sprayed rivals and critics with insults throughout his campaign. ‚ÄúI just love how she gets under Donald Trump‚Äôs skin,‚Äù Clinton said. Clinton‚Äôs decision to campaign with Warren for the first time in Cincinnati, a city on Ohio‚Äôs southwestern border with Kentucky and Indiana, underscored the swing state‚Äôs vital role in the November showdown with Trump. Ohio has backed every successful presidential nominee since 1964 and no Republican has won the White House without carrying the state.     Warren‚Äôs calls to rein in corporate excess could resonate with two groups Clinton must court in the election - Sanders supporters and those anxious about the economy who are drawn to Trump‚Äôs promise to toss out international trade deals. Ohio‚Äôs manufacturing base has taken a hit in recent economic slowdowns, and Trump has identified it as a state where his anti-free trade rhetoric could resonate with alienated blue-collar voters. Since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, Clinton has repeatedly tried to portray businessman Trump as fundamentally unfit for the presidency. Clinton said Warren‚Äôs long history of fighting for progressive economic values made her a perfect messenger for that critique. ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 "
"Advocates hail U.S. court abortion decision, predict national impact","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abortion rights advocates on Monday cheered a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that struck down restrictions to abortion access in Texas, calling it a major victory for women and predicting similar laws are now endangered nationwide. The high court ruled 5-3 that a Texas law imposing strict regulations on abortion doctors and facilities put an undue burden on women exercising their right to abortion, which has been legal in the United States since 1973. Laws such as the Texas regulations are seen by critics as a backdoor way of restricting abortion access. Hardest hit are rural, poor women for whom distance and cost put abortions out of reach, they say. The Texas law required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges, a formal affiliation that can be hard to obtain, at a hospital within 30 miles (50 km), and required clinics to have costly, hospital-grade facilities such as specified corridor width, floor tiles, parking spaces and elevator size. ‚ÄúWith today‚Äôs Supreme Court ruling, I let out a big exhale,‚Äù said Tracy Droz Tragos, director of ‚ÄúAbortion: Stories Women Tell,‚Äù to be released in August by HBO Documentary Films. ‚ÄúAt least for a moment, I am optimistic about the future of women in America.‚Äù Women have had their constitutional rights vindicated, said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights which represented the Texas clinics, in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court sent a loud and clear message that politicians cannot use deceptive means to shut down abortion clinics,‚Äù she said. Texas claimed its law protected women‚Äôs health, but critics said the regulations were medically unnecessary and intended to shut down clinics. Writing the Supreme Court decision, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote: ‚ÄúWe conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes.‚Äù ‚ÄúEach places a substantial obstacle in the path of women,‚Äù he wrote. Decrying the decision, anti-abortion groups such as the Susan B. Anthony List said Texas women will be unprotected from dangerous and unsanitary conditions. ‚ÄúThe abortion industry cannot be trusted to regulate itself and they know it,‚Äù said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the List, which supports anti-abortion political candidates. Making a similar argument, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, in a statement said abortion providers ‚Äúprey on the vulnerabilities of women who are in desperate situations, placing their bottom line over the health and safety of the patients.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd the U.S. Supreme Court, in efforts to put the so-called ‚Äòright to abortion‚Äô above everything else, just let them get away with it,‚Äù she said. Since the restrictive law was passed in 2013, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, a state of 27 million people, dropped to 19 from 41. ‚ÄúToday is a great day for women,‚Äù said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court has powerfully reaffirmed a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to make her own decisions about her health, family, and future, no matter her zip code,‚Äù she said. Similar laws are likely to be struck down, experts said, in states with restrictions such as requiring women to make repeated visits or requiring ultrasounds for women seeking abortions and that the images be shown to them. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve known for a long time that the purpose of these laws is to prevent women from having abortions,‚Äù said reproductive rights attorney Kathryn Kolbert, who argued a major abortion case before the high court in 1992. ‚ÄúIt may not be the death blow, but it certainly makes it more difficult to put forward these types of laws with a straight face,‚Äù she said. Documentary filmmaker Dawn Porter, who made a film about abortion providers in Texas and elsewhere in ‚ÄúTrapped‚Äù that was released this year, said she was ‚Äúelated.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs any silver lining in Texas making such an egregiously unconstitutional law, it‚Äôs that I think people have woken up and people are thinking you can‚Äôt taking any rights for granted,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou cannot sleep on your rights.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 "
Factbox: Major U.S. Supreme Court abortion rights cases,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs key rulings on abortion, dating to the landmark 1973 decision that legalized the procedure nationwide, have long provoked social, religious and political tensions. As the court majority became more conservative over the decades, it set standards that enhance states‚Äô ability to regulate abortion. Yet even in the most recent rulings, extending to 2007, there have never been five votes on the nine-member court to reverse the fundamental right to abortion. Here is a look at the court‚Äôs major abortion rulings. Roe v. Wade, 1973, 7-2 vote The court rules that a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to privacy protects her decision to end a pregnancy, and only a compelling state interest can justify regulating abortion. The decision institutes a three-part legal test, connected to a nine-month pregnancy and a fetus‚Äô viability, that gives states more latitude for regulation with each trimester. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 1992, 5-4 vote The court affirms the right to abortion. Rather than the trimester framework, the test is whether a government regulation imposes an ‚Äúundue burden‚Äù on a woman seeking an abortion by creating a ‚Äúsubstantial obstacle‚Äù to the procedure before the fetus develops to the point at which it becomes viable. Stenberg v. Carhart, 2000, 5-4 vote The court decides that a Nebraska ban on a late-term procedure critics call ‚Äúpartial birth abortion‚Äù violates a woman‚Äôs right to abortion. The procedure, known medically as ‚Äúintact dilation and extraction,‚Äù involves a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it. The justices fault the Nebraska ban, similar to laws in a majority of the states at the time, for its ambiguity about precisely what type of medical procedure is prohibited and for lacking an exception for the health of the mother. Gonzales v. Carhart, 2007, 5-4 vote The court decides that a federal Partial Birth Abortion Act, involving the same type of procedure as in the Nebraska dispute and without an exception for the woman‚Äôs health, is constitutional. The majority distinguishes the ruling from the 2000 case by noting that Congress developed findings that the procedure would never be necessary for the health of the mother. Another factor in the reversed course was that in 2000, Justice Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor had voted to strike down the partial-birth ban. She was succeeded by Samuel Alito in 2006, and in 2007 he cast the fifth vote in favor of the ban. Whole Woman‚Äôs Health v. Hellerstedt, 2016, 5-3 vote The court strikes down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities, finding that the 2013 statute put an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy. The court declares that both provisions of the law - requiring physicians who perform abortions to have difficult-to-obtain ‚Äúadmitting privileges‚Äù at a local hospital and requiring clinics to install costly hospital-grade facilities - violate abortion rights. The ruling marked the firmest endorsement of U.S. abortion rights since the 1992 Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey ruling. ",politicsNews,"June 26, 2016 "
Timeline: Milestones in legal fight over Texas abortion law,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a victory to abortion rights advocates, striking down a Texas law imposing strict regulations on abortion doctors and facilities. Following is a timeline of that challenge. July 2013 - The Republican-led Texas legislature passes and Republican Governor Rick Perry signs the law known as H.B. 2, putting new requirements on abortion providers. State officials say the law is intended to ensure the health and safety of women. September 2013 ‚Äì Before the law is enforced, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers challenge the measure. They assert that certain provisions, including one related to doctors‚Äô ‚Äúadmitting privileges‚Äù - a type of formal affiliation - at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of an abortion clinic, are aimed at decreasing the abortion availability in the state. October 2013 ‚Äì A U.S. district judge sides largely with the challengers, blocking the admitting privileges provision. March 2014 - The New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, a regional federal appeals court covering Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, reverses the lower court and permits much of the law to take effect.  April 2014 - Whole Woman‚Äôs Health and other abortion providers bring a new complaint against Texas, citing the effect of the law‚Äôs implementation and the number of clinics that have closed. The challengers focus on the admitting-privileges requirement and regulations governing clinic facility standards. August 2014 ‚Äì A U.S. district court judge declares the admitting privileges and clinic requirements an unconstitutional burden on women‚Äôs access to abortion. October 2014 - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit intervenes to allow implementation of both new regulations, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocks part of the order so that the mandate that clinics meet hospital-grade standards does not go into effect. June 2015 - After considering the full merits of the challenge, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reverses the district judge‚Äôs decision, finding the judge should have deferred to the legislature‚Äôs stated health and safety goals. The appeals court also says most of the lawsuit should have been barred because the legal issues it raises already were addressed in the case filed by Planned Parenthood. June 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote puts a temporary hold on the 5th Circuit‚Äôs ruling while the justices consider whether to hear the challengers‚Äô appeal. That action blocks the provision regarding hospital-grade standards from taking effect. September 2015 - The abortion providers challenging the Texas restrictions ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their appeal of the 5th Circuit‚Äôs ruling. November 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the challenge by abortion providers to the Texas restrictions. February 2016 - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a supporter of abortion restrictions, dies at age 79, leaving the court shorthanded and evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives.

Clinton campaign hits Trump for seeing Brexit as boon to his business,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign accused Donald Trump on Sunday of caring more about how Britain‚Äôs historic vote to leave the European Union would benefit his financial bottom line than how it would impact the U.S. economy. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook acknowledged parallels between the populist anger and anti-establishment fervor that fueled the Brexit vote and Trump‚Äôs rise to the nomination, but said the Republican candidate‚Äôs reaction showed he was not fit to occupy the White House. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton looks at this through the lens of how it‚Äôs going to affect middle-class families, Donald Trump through the lens of how it will help his bottom line,‚Äù Mook said on ‚ÄúFox News Sunday.‚Äù  Without mentioning Trump by name, Clinton also warned that ‚Äúbombastic comments in turbulent times can actually cause more turbulence‚Äù in a speech to a conference of city mayors in Indianapolis on Sunday afternoon. Her campaign released a national television advertisement earlier in the day, which featured the wealthy real estate developer‚Äôs comments on Friday that the fall of the British currency after the Brexit vote could mean more business for his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, where he was speaking.  ‚ÄúEvery president is tested by world events, but Donald Trump thinks about how his golf resort can profit from them,‚Äù said the  30-second video. Besides his currency comments, Trump had praised the Brexit result as an example of people ‚Äútaking their country back.‚Äù He responded to the advertisement on Sunday by saying Clinton, whose staff had said she supported the United Kingdom remaining in the union, had poor judgment. ‚ÄúClinton is trying to wash away her bad judgment call on BREXIT with big dollar ads,‚Äù ran a message on his Twitter account. ‚ÄúDisgraceful!‚Äù Paul Manafort, campaign manager for Trump, rejected what he called a ‚Äúphony‚Äù charge by Clinton and said Trump was more in sync with the global economic frustration exemplified by the Brexit vote. In contrast, the Clinton ad showed her campaign‚Äôs ‚Äútone deafness‚Äù by focusing on things the American people did not care about, he said in an NBC interview. In her speech on Sunday, Clinton said the United States and the United Kingdom were different ‚Äúeconomically, politically, demographically,‚Äù but still drew some parallels between the mood of American and British voters. ‚ÄúJust as we have seen, there are many frustrated people in Britain, we know there are frustrated people here at home, too,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have seen it, I‚Äôve heard it, I know it.‚Äù Global stock markets nosedived on Friday and economic experts warned of a potential global recession after the shocking British vote to pull out of the European Union. Markets prepared for the possibility of more pain on Monday. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Brexit vote highlighted global anxieties about economic stagnation and immigration. ‚ÄúThe genius of what‚Äôs happened with the candidacy of Donald Trump is he‚Äôs given voice to that, just as was given in the UK,‚Äù Corker, who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick for Trump, said on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù program. He said he thought Trump‚Äôs appearance at his golf course in Scotland after the Brexit vote ‚Äúwas one of his best events‚Äù and  his comments about the British currency and what it would mean for his businesses were just ‚Äúan anecdotal statement‚Äù about its effects. ‚ÄúHe was giving an example, which is obvious, that when the currency fluctuates, as it does, more Americans are going to be able to travel to the UK more cheaply,‚Äù he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the Brexit vote showed people were tired of being dictated to by ‚Äúunelected bureaucrats in Brussels,‚Äù and said there were parallels in the United States. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who built his White House campaign against Clinton around populist proposals to eradicate income inequality, remove big money from politics and rein in Wall Street, said the Brexit vote encapsulated many of those concerns. ‚ÄúWhat ordinary people are saying is ‚Äòhey, give us an economy that works for all of us, not just the people on top,‚Äô‚Äù Sanders said on CNN.

Trump plays down post-Brexit market turmoil on Aberdeen visit,"ABERDEEN, Scotland (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump played down market turmoil in the wake of Britain‚Äôs decision to leave the European Union on a visit to his Trump International golf course in Aberdeen on Saturday. Wearing an open-necked shirt, a suit and a white baseball cap with his slogan ‚ÄúMake America great again‚Äù, Trump was asked if he was worried about the volatility in financial markets following Britain‚Äôs vote to leave the EU on Thursday.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always turmoil no matter where you go, no matter what you do,‚Äù he said. Global stock markets lost about $2 trillion in value on Friday after the vote, while sterling fell to a 31-year low. Trump, whose mother was Scottish, was greeted by around a dozen protesters at the course waving Mexican flags, rainbow flags for Gay Pride day and signs that read ‚ÄúDonald stop the hating‚Äù and ‚ÄúShame on you for ruining a beautiful landscape.‚Äù Trump last year proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States as a response to Islamist attacks in Paris and California, causing a furor in Europe. In an article in a Scottish newspaper earlier this year, Trump pointed to his determination to overcome local opposition to his golf course projects as an example of the leadership skills that Americans would get if he were to become president. He also met with News Corporation media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his wife Jerry Hall, giving them a tour of the course in a golf cart. ",politicsNews,"June 25, 2016 "
TransCanada formally seeks NAFTA damages in Keystone XL rejection,"TORONTO (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp is formally requesting arbitration over U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, seeking $15 billion in damages, the company said in legal papers dated Friday.  TransCanada submitted a notice for an arbitration claim in January and had then tried to negotiate with the U.S. government to ‚Äúreach an amicable settlement,‚Äù the company said in files posted on the pipeline‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the parties were unable to settle the dispute.‚Äù TransCanada said it then filed its formal arbitration request under North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provisions, seeking to recover what it says are costs and damages. The Keystone XL was designed to link existing pipeline networks in Canada and the United States to bring crude from Alberta and North Dakota to refineries in Illinois and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico coast.      Obama rejected the cross-border crude oil pipeline last November, seven years after it was first proposed, saying it would not make a meaningful long-term contribution to the U.S. economy. TransCanada is suing the United States in federal court in a separate legal action, seeking to reverse the pipeline‚Äôs rejection. NAFTA, whose arbitration provisions allow companies to challenge governments before international panels, has been a target of recent anti-free-trade sentiments in the United States. The heads of NAFTA members, Canada, the United States and Mexico, are expected to meet in Ottawa for a North American leaders‚Äô Summit on June 29. Canada was supposed to host the meeting early last year but canceled it amid tension between then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline.

Obama tries to limit fallout from British EU exit vote,"PALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday tried to limit the fallout from Britain‚Äôs vote to leave the European Union, which threatens to harm the U.S. economic recovery, derail his trade agenda and  distract U.S. allies from global security issues.    Obama, who had argued passionately against Britain leaving the EU in a trip to the country this year, vowed that Washington would still maintain both its ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù with London and close ties to Brussels.           ‚ÄúWhile the UK‚Äôs relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations. That will endure,‚Äù he told an event at Stanford University, referring to close ally Britain. ‚ÄúThe EU will remain one of our indispensable partners,‚Äù Obama said. He spoke to outgoing British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the stunning result of Thursday‚Äôs referendum, the biggest blow to the European project of greater unity since World War Two. Obama said he was sure Britain‚Äôs exit would be orderly and vowed that the United States and Britain would ‚Äústay focused on ensuring economic growth and financial stability.‚Äù  The Brexit result rattled Wall Street and many other financial markets, with global stock markets losing about $2 trillion in value on Friday.     ‚ÄúI must say we had looked for a different outcome. We would have preferred a different outcome,‚Äù U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, traveling in Ireland, said on Friday. The historic divorce launched by the Brexit vote could sink hopes of a massive U.S.-EU free trade deal before Obama leaves the White House in January.               Negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti-trade sentiment on both continents.     As well as the global economic consequences, Brexit makes it more difficult for Obama and the United States to corral its Western allies into joint action against challenges such as Islamic State, Russia and the rise of China. Britain‚Äôs exit could present the next U.S. president with a decision on whether to turn to other key European partners like Germany and France, essentially downgrading the United States‚Äô special bond with Britain, whose foundation was laid in World War Two. Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, called on Washington‚Äôs partners in Europe to keep their eye on foreign policy threats. ‚ÄúWe must maintain our trans-Atlantic consensus on how to deal with a resurgent Russia and the growing threat of ISIS,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI urge leaders in London, Brussels and across Europe to not lose sight of these threats and remain coordinated in our response.‚Äù  The U.S. presidential election candidates are casting an eye across the Atlantic at the unlikely success of Britain‚Äôs ‚ÄúLeave‚Äù campaign, which has similarities with Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs insurgent bid for the Nov. 8 election. Trump‚Äôs rise was sustained by a similar brew of anti-establishment and anti-globalization sentiment and concern about immigration that helped the Leave vote.  ‚ÄúThis is a protest vote against globalization and there is one presidential candidate who won the nomination who has put globalization in his crosshairs - and that‚Äôs Donald Trump,‚Äù Republican strategist John Feehery said.                  Biden, in remarks prepared for a speech at Dublin Castle, took a swipe at Trump without mentioning him by name. He warned against ‚Äúpoliticians and demagogues peddling xenophobia, nationalism, and isolationism.‚Äù         Brexit supporter Trump called the result a ‚Äúgreat thing.‚Äù     ‚ÄúPeople want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense. You see it with Europe, all over Europe,‚Äù Trump, 70, said in Turnberry, Scotland where he reopened a golf course.  Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said Britain‚Äôs electoral shock showed that national leaders will be punished if they do not ‚Äúfirst ensure they have protected the safety and legitimate interests of their own people.‚Äù ‚ÄúBrexit is a warning for America,‚Äù said Sessions, a Trump supporter who criticized ‚Äúradical trade policies that erode the power of the people to control their lives.‚Äù            Obama had warned British voters against Brexit, in an unusually strong intervention into British politics in April. The White House said on Friday that he stands by a comment made then that Britain would move to the back of the queue when it comes to trade deals with the United States if it left the EU.        Obama hopes his former secretary of state Hillary Clinton will win the November election and safeguard his legacy but economic volatility in the United States after Brexit could hurt her chances of beating Trump. In response to Britain‚Äôs decision to leave, Clinton said the United States must first safeguard against any economic fallout at home at ‚Äúthis time of uncertainty‚Äù and underscore its commitment to both Britain and Europe.      The U.S. Federal Reserve sought to calm global financial markets by saying it was ready to provide dollar liquidity following the British vote. U.S. financial regulators said the country‚Äôs financial system is functioning in an ‚Äúorderly manner.‚Äù  The Financial Stability Oversight Council - which includes the heads of the U.S. Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Reserve - ‚Äúnoted that the U.S. financial system continues to function in an orderly manner, and that the Council will continue to monitor ongoing developments,‚Äù according to a summary released after a phone call among members. After Brexit, the U.S. central bank‚Äôs ambitions for two rate rises this year now look unlikely. Traders of U.S.-interest rate futures even began to price in a small chance of a Fed rate cut, and now see little chance of any hike until the end of next year. ‚ÄúOne can forget about rate hikes in the near term,‚Äù said Thomas Costerg, New York-based economist at Standard Chartered Bank. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm worried about is that the Brexit vote could be the straw that breaks the back of the U.S. growth picture.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "
Clinton regains double-digit lead over Trump: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton regained a double-digit lead over Republican rival Donald Trump this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The June 20-24 poll showed that 46.6 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton while 33.3 percent supported Trump. Another 20.1 percent said they would support neither candidate. Trump had enjoyed a brief boost in support following the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, as he doubled down on his pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country, cutting Clinton‚Äôs lead to nine points.  But Trump‚Äôs rise in popularity appeared to be only temporary, unlike his lasting surge among the Republican field last year after the attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino, California. Clinton‚Äôs 13.3 percentage point lead is about the same as she had before the Orlando attack.  Trump‚Äôs slip this week came as he struggled to show that he can keep up with a Clinton campaign apparatus that has dwarfed his in size and funding.  Campaign finance disclosures released earlier this week showed Trump started June with a war chest of just $1.3 million, a fraction of Clinton‚Äôs $42 million. Trump sought to ease concerns among his allies by saying that he could tap his ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù personal wealth if needed, and also by bolstering efforts to raise money through fundraising events and online donations. Meanwhile, Republican leaders including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker continued to express reservations about their new standard bearer, who has angered some in the party with his fiery rhetoric.  Ryan and Walker both said over the past week that they felt Republicans should follow their ‚Äúconscience‚Äù when deciding to support the party‚Äôs likely nominee, instead of urging party members to support him. The poll only captured some of the voter reaction to Britain‚Äôs decision in Thursday‚Äôs referendum to exit the European Union, a move that some pundits say suggests Trump‚Äôs insurgent candidacy has tapped into a broad and powerful anti-globalization wave sweeping Western countries. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online and included interviews with 1,201 likely voters in all 50 states. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.3 percentage points.

Brexit crisis tops off rough stretch in Obama's push for legacy,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - The financial and political fallout from Britain‚Äôs vote to leave the European Union has added to a string of setbacks for President Barack Obama as he works to burnish his legacy before his presidency ends in January 2017. The Brexit decision came after a deadlock in the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday effectively ended Obama‚Äôs push to overhaul immigration rules, and the week after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. For Obama, the reversals heighten pressure on him and fellow Democrats to work harder for the Nov. 8 elections - particularly for the party‚Äôs presumptive presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, who represents his best shot at making sure more of his policies are not rolled back. Speaking at two fundraising events in Seattle on Friday night, at the end of an arduous day that saw global markets plunge after the Brexit vote, Obama acknowledged the shifting political winds four months from the vote. ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt think the stakes were high before, you should think the stakes are pretty high right now,‚Äù Obama said at an intimate fundraising dinner at the home of tech executive Steve Singh. Guests, arranged in two long tables, paid $10,000 to $66,800 per couple. Obama has argued technology and globalization can increase opportunities for all, but conceded that recent events show many people are frightened by global competition and feel left behind. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and political novice, has tapped into those concerns about the economy, trade and immigration - fears that also figured into the UK campaign to leave the EU. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, when people are anxious and scared, there are going to be politicians out there who try to prey on that frustration to get themselves headlines and to get themselves votes,‚Äù Obama told about 3,000 people who paid $250 and up to attend a campaign-style event on Friday for Washington State‚Äôs Democratic Governor Jay Inslee. Clinton regained a double-digit lead over Trump this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday that showed 46.6 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton while 33.3 percent backed Trump. In April, Obama had taken the unusual step of traveling to London to help the ‚ÄúRemain‚Äù camp of the referendum for his friend and ally, Prime Minister David Cameron, who will now leave office before Obama does. The financial uncertainty from Brexit threatens to weigh on the strong U.S. economy and undo some of the recovery seen since Obama took office in early 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Earlier this week, Obama‚Äôs plan to remove the specter of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants was quashed when the Supreme Court deadlocked over lifting a hold on the action. And two weeks ago, the nation‚Äôs worst mass shooting in modern history, at a gay nightclub in Orlando, raised questions about how Obama is dealing with home-grown extremism - and served as a reminder of his failure to convince the U.S. Congress to tighten gun laws. The setbacks show the limits of action that any president can take unilaterally, said Justin Vaughn, a political scientist at Boise State University. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Obama‚Äôs legacy has taken a hit so much as it came back to earth,‚Äù Vaughn said. Still, the impression that his administration is unable to control its own political destiny could weigh on how history views Obama‚Äôs time at the White House, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist at University of Houston.     ‚ÄúPresidents are often judged by what happens in the ninth inning, so President Obama‚Äôs last few months in office are important to cementing and enhancing his legacy,‚Äù Rottinghaus said.

"British EU exit a model for Trump's campaign, he says","TURNBERRY, Scotland (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump thrust himself into the heart of Britain‚Äôs vote to leave the European Union on Friday, calling it a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù development and drawing parallels to his own insurgent campaign. In Scotland to reopen a golf resort he owns, the wealthy New York businessman wasted no time interpreting the outcome of the ‚ÄúBrexit‚Äù vote as an example of a global uprising against the established order. It‚Äôs an argument he said fit in with his own campaign to shake up Washington by renegotiating free trade deals and stopping illegal immigration. ‚ÄúPeople want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense. You see it with Europe, all over Europe,‚Äù Trump, 70, the presumptive Republican nominee, told a news conference at the Trump Turnberry golf course.  He said the economic shock from the vote would ebb over time and that more European countries might want to break with the 28-nation European Union. Americans, he said, would have a chance ‚Äúto re-declare their independence‚Äù and ‚Äúreject today‚Äôs rule by the global elite‚Äù when they vote on Nov. 8. ‚ÄúSo I think you‚Äôre going to have this happen more and more. I really believe that, and I think that it‚Äôs happening in the United States. It‚Äôs happening by the fact that I‚Äôve done so well in the polls,‚Äù he said. Trump‚Äôs rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, said in a statement: ‚ÄúThis time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans‚Äô pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.   ‚ÄúIt also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down,‚Äù said Clinton, 68, a former U.S. secretary of state, who had openly favored Britain‚Äôs remaining in the EU.     More than half a million Britons signed a petition earlier this year to bar Trump from entering Britain, where he has business interests, in response to his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. British lawmakers decided against a ban as a violation of free speech. Trump assailed as inappropriate Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs open appeals to Britain not to split off. Shaking off a tradition of not commenting on U.S. politics from foreign soil, Trump said Obama had been embarrassed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something he shouldn‚Äôt have done. It‚Äôs not his country. It‚Äôs not his part of the world. He shouldn‚Äôt have done it. And I actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail,‚Äù Trump said. Democrats and Republicans both took stock of a decision that seemed to indicate Trump‚Äôs campaign had tapped into a global wave that might be hard to contain. Joined by his sons Don Jr. and Eric and daughter Ivanka, who help manage his business affairs, Trump arrived in his signature helicopter near his clubhouse resort, a Scottish flag blowing in the wind. The candidate praised his children‚Äôs business acumen, his Scottish-born mother and the golf course itself, dismissing complaints from Republicans that he should have stuck to the campaign trail at home. As it happened, by turning up when he did, Trump drew global televised attention to his views on the Brexit vote within hours of Britons waking up to the surprising result. ‚ÄúI said this was going to happen and I think that it‚Äôs a great thing,‚Äù said Trump, who weeks ago said he would be inclined to leave the EU. Trump had exchanged insults with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who supported staying in the EU and said on Friday after the vote he would resign by October. Cameron had called Trump‚Äôs anti-immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. ‚ÄúI think David Cameron is a good man. He was wrong on this.  He didn‚Äôt get the mood of his country right. He was surprised,‚Äù Trump said, predicting that Britain and the United States would remain ‚Äúgreat allies.‚Äù Wearing a white hat emblazoned with his ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù campaign slogan, Trump walked up to the news conference with bagpipers heralding his arrival. His visit to Turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in Aberdeen on Saturday, coincided with a vote that exposed deep divisions in Britain and dealt the biggest blow to the European project of greater unity since World War Two. Some Scots who are Turnberry members and who sat in the front row at Trump‚Äôs news conference muttered ‚Äúno‚Äù whenever the subject of Scotland leaving the EU came up. Scotland voted by a margin of 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the EU, a result sharply at odds with Britain as a whole, which voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave. Trump, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of Americans in an opinion poll, defeated a crowded field of opponents for the Republican nomination while weathering one controversy after another. The latest was over the firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention. Trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on Scotland‚Äôs west coast, 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Glasgow. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "
Sanders will vote for Clinton to stop Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said on Friday he would vote for Hillary Clinton to stop Republican Donald Trump from winning the White House, a lukewarm show of support that his campaign said was not a formal endorsement. Sanders‚Äô comments come after weeks of pressure from Democratic Party officials to throw his weight behind Clinton, the presumptive nominee. She locked up the required number of delegates this month with a string of wins in state-by-state primary contests. Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state, senator, and first lady, needs Sanders‚Äô supporters to boost her chances against Trump in the Nov. 8 election. Only 40 percent of them say they would vote for her, with the rest undecided or divided between Trump, a third-party candidate and staying home, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.  Asked if he would vote for Clinton in November, Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, told MSNBC television: ‚ÄúYes. The issue right here is I‚Äôm going to do everything I can to defeat Donald Trump. I think Trump in so many ways would be a disaster for this country if he were elected president.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe do not need a president whose cornerstone of his campaign is bigotry, who is insulting Mexicans and Latinos and Muslims and women, who does not believe in the reality of climate change,‚Äù he continued. A spokeswoman for Sanders said his comments on MSNBC did not amount to an endorsement of Clinton, adding that ‚ÄúSenator Sanders is also still an active candidate.‚Äù Trump has angered minority groups with his hard line on immigration, including calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country, deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border if he is elected.  A spokeswoman for Trump‚Äôs campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The wealthy New York businessman has rejected accusations his proposals are bigoted, and has said his policies would help minorities by bolstering the economy and creating jobs. Trump has also called climate change a hoax by the Chinese to hurt business in the United States.       Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, managed to turn his long-shot run into a mass movement with proposals to combat wealth inequality, increase access to healthcare and education, and defend the environment. His challenge to Clinton, one of the best-known figures in U.S. politics, lasted far longer than expected, running for four months and across 50 states and yielding record numbers of small donations to his campaign. Sanders has said he will continue to push for a liberal agenda heading into the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia from July 25-28, when Clinton‚Äôs nomination is expected to become official. He has also made clear he does not want his presence to hurt the party‚Äôs chances of holding onto the White House.  Three-quarters of likely Democratic voters in the general election say Sanders should have a ‚Äúmajor role‚Äù in shaping the party‚Äôs positions, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted June 17-21. Nearly two-thirds also said that Sanders should endorse Clinton.  ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "

"Republican ex-Treasury chief Paulson slams Trump, to vote for Clinton","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Henry Paulson, a Republican who was U.S. Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial meltdown, on Friday called a Donald Trump presidency ‚Äúunthinkable‚Äù and said he will vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Paulson joins a growing list of establishment Republicans who say they will not cast a ballot in the Nov. 8 election for Trump, the party‚Äôs presumptive nominee and a political neophyte whose populist rhetoric runs counter to many long-held Republican principles. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump,‚Äù Paulson, who was chief executive of Goldman Sachs before becoming Treasury chief under Republican President George W. Bush, wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world,‚Äù he said. Paulson accused Trump, who has touted his business acumen as a real estate developer during his campaign, of taking ‚Äúimprudent risk‚Äù and then disavowing his debts when ventures fail. He also took aim at Trump‚Äôs opposition to trade agreements, which Paulson said have created U.S. jobs and fostered innovation and competitiveness. ‚ÄúSimply put, a Trump presidency is unthinkable,‚Äù Paulson said. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brent Scowcroft, a national security adviser to two Republican presidents, endorsed Clinton on Wednesday, and Richard Armitage, a deputy secretary of state under George W. Bush, said last week he would support her. Paulson, who helped steer a $700 billion bailout of the financial system through Congress during the financial meltdown, said Trump is a ‚Äúphony‚Äù who is unfit to be president. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help but think what would have happened if a divisive character such as Trump were president during the 2008 financial crisis, at a time when leadership, compromise and careful analysis were critical,‚Äù he said.

U.S. committed to bringing American hostages home -Obama,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday said the United States remains committed to bringing home Americans held captive overseas and helping their families, a year after the administration promised to overhaul its handling of hostage situations. ‚ÄúWe will not stop until we can bring our fellow citizens back to their families,‚Äù Obama said in a statement on the anniversary of the White House‚Äôs policy review. Obama specifically named journalist Austin Tice who disappeared in Syria in 2012, Caitlan Coleman held in Afghanistan, and retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who went missing in Iran more than nine years ago. Earlier this week, the families of four Americans killed by Islamic State urged Obama to do everything possible to bring home Tice, the only U.S. journalist known to be held in war-torn Syria. The parents of the slain hostages criticized Obama for not personally naming Tice in his remarks at this year‚Äôs White House Correspondents‚Äô Association Dinner when Obama said that he would ‚Äúfight for the release of American hostages held against their will.‚Äù  They said Tice‚Äôs return would be a test of the of the success of the administration‚Äôs new policy. The White House undertook a six-month review of its hostage policies after complaints from families that their initiatives to free relatives captured abroad had been discouraged and sometimes blocked by government officials. As part of the overhaul, Obama named James O‚ÄôBrien special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department to help coordinate the efforts of law enforcement and diplomats. ‚ÄúBut I know our work will not be done until our fellow Americans who are held against their will, and whose families mark their calendars by the days since they‚Äôve held their loved ones, are reunited,‚Äù Obama said.

"U.S. states, Rockefellers clash with U.S. House panel on Exxon climate probes","HOUSTON (Reuters) - With a number of U.S. states proceeding with investigations of Exxon Mobil Corp‚Äôs (XOM.N) record on climate change, the attorney general of Massachusetts and investment funds of the Rockefeller family on Friday told a Congressional committee it lacked powers to oversee those probes. The pushback is the latest chapter in a high-stakes fight between the world‚Äôs largest publicly traded oil company and a coalition of state attorneys general who have said they would go after Exxon to try and force action to tackle climate change.    The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology last week reiterated demands that state attorneys general hand over any records of consultations the prosecutors had with outside environmental groups before their probes were opened. Republicans on the committee have said about 20 state officials overreached when they jointly said in March they would participate in inquiries into whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of climate change. State officials have said the committee has no right to get involved. ‚ÄúThe Committee lacks authority to interfere with an investigation by the Massachusetts Attorney General‚Äôs Office into possible violations of Massachusetts law by ExxonMobil,‚Äù said a letter to the committee from the office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey that was seen by Reuters. In another letter to the House panel seen by Reuters, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund, two investment funds that have been critical of fossil fuels linked to climate change, said the committee‚Äôs request ‚Äúimperiled the funds‚Äô First Amendment rights‚Äù and said ‚ÄúCongress‚Äôs investigatory power is not unlimited.‚Äù Last week, Exxon asked a federal court to throw out a subpoena that would force it to hand over decades of documents on climate change to Healey‚Äôs office. Both sides in the standoff have sought to use the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom speech and freedom of assembly, among other protections, to press their cases.  The House committee has complained the inquiries risk stifling free speech and scientific inquiry, and that state officials were coordinating with special interest groups.

New York LGBT bar becomes first U.S. monument to gay rights,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday designated the site of a watershed event in the history of U.S. gay rights, the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, as a national monument, the first to honor the contributions of gay Americans. The Stonewall Inn gay bar in Manhattan‚Äôs Greenwich Village was the scene of a police raid that triggered riots and ignited a long struggle to bring lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people into the American mainstream and guarantee their rights. ‚ÄúWelcome to the family,‚Äù the National Park Service said in a  tweet welcoming its 412th site. LGBT rights advocacy groups hailed the national recognition, saying it will help highlight the gay communities‚Äô continued struggles, especially in the aftermath of the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida that killed 49 people. ‚ÄúThis new national monument will be a source of inspiration to a new generation of Americans across the country standing up for equality and uniting to show the world that love conquers hate,‚Äù Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said. The move was the latest of several steps Obama has take on  gay rights during his presidency.  In 2010, he signed a law repealing a policy that had banned gays from serving openly in the U.S. military. In 2012, he became the first president to support gay marriage, a stance he has admitted took time to evolve. His administration also supported the legal challenge that led to the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide. ‚ÄúThere is important distance yet to travel, but through political engagement and litigation, as well as individual acts of courage and acceptance, this movement has made tremendous progress toward securing equal rights and equal dignity,‚Äù Obama said in a proclamation officially designating the historic site. The events of late June and early July 1969 in New York helped start the modern American gay rights movement. A week of violent clashes on Christopher Street between patrons of the Stonewall Inn and police, who had periodically raided the bar, arresting gays under morals laws of the era, became known as the Stonewall riots. The crackdown was also tied up in a dispute between the Mafia, which owned the bar, and corrupt police officers seeking payoffs for protection. But it unleashed a year of protests, culminating with the first gay pride parade in 1970. This year‚Äôs weekend LGBT pride festivities started in New York on Friday with a street fair and were to culminate with Sunday‚Äôs parade through Lower Manhattan. Events were scheduled across the country in San Francisco, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City and elsewhere. Obama‚Äôs designation protects about 7.7 acres (3.1 hectares) of land, including the Stonewall Inn and nearby Christopher Park. U.S. lawmakers representing New York, in a statement, called the site ‚Äúa beacon for liberation.‚Äù It drew renewed attention in the wake of this month‚Äôs massacre in Orlando at another gay venue, a nightclub called Pulse. Mourners in New York flocked to the inn and created a makeshift memorial after the shooting, the worst such attack in modern U.S. history.  In honor of the new monument, the White House will release a video that will be played on billboards in New York‚Äôs Times Square on Saturday. U.S. officials will also hold a designation ceremony at Stonewall on Monday. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "
Could Brexit vote be a preview of U.S. presidential race?,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain‚Äôs stunning vote to leave the European Union, buoyed by a frenzy of nationalism and populist anger, was a crushing rejection of the political elite. Republican Donald Trump hopes it is also a preview of November‚Äôs U.S. presidential election. The referendum result reverberated immediately in a U.S. presidential campaign dominated by Trump‚Äôs rapid rise to capture the nomination, fueled by a similar brew of anti-establishment and anti-globalization sentiment. The vote in Britain reinforced the notion that the insurgent campaign launched by the wealthy real estate developer had tapped into a global political movement that might be hard to stop. ‚ÄúThis is a protest vote against globalization and there is one presidential candidate who won the nomination who has put globalization in his crosshairs - and that‚Äôs Donald Trump,‚Äù Republican strategist John Feehery said. Trump, who has spent much of his campaign warning of the dangers posed by immigrants who illegally enter from Mexico and proposing a temporary ban on U.S. entry for Muslims, has matched the global mood with his rhetoric. ‚ÄúThere are swaths of the population around the world who are struggling economically in the current economy, and groping for targets of blame,‚Äù said Katherine Cramer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ‚ÄúTrump and the Brexit vote offer up tangible targets, and it is not surprising that people grab onto them. The vote yesterday is a reminder that Trump could very well win the presidential election,‚Äù she said. A Brexit supporter, Trump was happy to note the parallels to his own campaign when he reopened his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, on Friday. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton bemoaned the result. The referendum, which most British opinion polls had predicted was headed to defeat, was a wake-up call for Democrats who have been heartened by Clinton‚Äôs lead over Trump in opinion polls of late. ‚ÄúI woke up this morning a little dismayed,‚Äù said Democratic strategist Dane Strother. ‚ÄúThe question is whether Trump is similarly underperforming in the polls here. If that under-polled anger was present in Britain, as a Democrat you have to hope it isn‚Äôt mirrored here.‚Äù Global stock markets wobbled immediately after the vote, which experts warned could trigger a global recession and weaken the U.S. economy. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said after the vote he could step down by October, presents a cautionary lesson for Clinton as she prepares to face Trump. British voters ignored repeated warnings from Cameron about the dire consequences of a departure from the European Union. Clinton can take advantage of the unsettled global mood without indulging in predictions of doom or the over-the-top rhetoric that sometimes has set back Trump, Republican strategist Rich Galen said. ‚ÄúShe can reflect some of the same sentiment that Trump and the Brexit forces tapped into but use it to her advantage,‚Äù Galen said. ‚ÄúShe is not going to, and doesn‚Äôt want to, out-Trump Trump, but the idea is to say, ‚ÄòI understand these concerns.‚Äô‚Äù Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters after the vote that she has ‚Äúa real confidence that Americans are generous, tolerant, big-hearted people‚Äù who believe that the country is stronger together. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to watch what impact (the Brexit vote) ends up having on the U.K. and on the British economy and come November, they are going to make their own decision about the kind of leadership that they‚Äôre looking for,‚Äù he said. Differences between the electorates in the United Kingdom and the United States are one reason the Brexit sentiment may not translate fully into success for Trump.  About 30 million votes were cast in the last British general election in 2015, with about 10 percent of those cast by minority voters. Polling in the UK ahead of the Brexit vote suggested broad support for staying in the EU among those voters. By contrast, according to the Pew Research Center, nonwhite voters constituted 26 percent of all voters in the 2012 U.S. general election ‚Äî and by a huge margin they backed Democratic President Barack Obama. Pew projects that by November, nearly one in three voters will be a minority, and opinion polls show Trump struggling with those blocs. Just being more mature, experienced and sympathetic than Trump may not be enough for Clinton. ‚ÄúThe argument is you need a responsible grownup, but a large part of the world doesn‚Äôt want a responsible grownup,‚Äù said Tom Rath, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough to say I know all the stuff he doesn‚Äôt or he‚Äôs rash, because right now people aren‚Äôt filtering that through.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "
UK 'Leave' vote deflates hopes for U.S.-EU trade deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain‚Äôs looming exit from the European Union is another huge setback for negotiations on a massive U.S.-EU free trade deal that were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti-trade sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic.  The historic divorce launched by Thursday‚Äôs vote will almost certainly further delay substantial progress in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks as the remaining 27 EU states sort out their own new relationship with Britain, trade experts said on Friday.  With French and German officials increasingly voicing skepticism about TTIP‚Äôs chances for success, the United Kingdom‚Äôs departure from the deal could sink hopes of a deal before President Barack Obama leaves office in January. ‚ÄúThis is yet another reason why TTIP will likely be postponed,‚Äù said Heather Conley, European program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington. ‚ÄúBut to be honest, TTIP isn‚Äôt going anywhere, I believe, before 2018 at the earliest,‚Äù she said. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement on Friday that he was evaluating the UK decision‚Äôs impact on TTIP, but would continue to engage with both European and UK counterparts.     ‚ÄúThe importance of trade and investment is indisputable in our relationships with both the European Union and the United Kingdom,‚Äù Froman said. ‚ÄúThe economic and strategic rationale for T-TIP remains strong.‚Äù TTIP negotiators are still expected to meet in Brussels in mid-July as scheduled, but those talks were aimed at focusing on less controversial issues while leaving the thorniest disagreements for U.S. and EU political leaders to resolve. And it is unclear when Britain will launch formal separation proceedings, which will take at least two years. But analysts said both sides have been reluctant to put their best offers on the table with a new U.S. president due to take office in January and French and German leadership elections nearing in 2017. The Brexit also will preoccupy EU officials in coming months as they launch their own negotiations with London over the future terms of UK-EU trade, and sort out their post-Brexit priorities, said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based think tank.     Britain‚Äôs departure could leave U.S. negotiators facing a European side that is more dug-in on some issues, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank in Washington. ‚ÄúAs the UK is part of the coalition of liberal trading economies in the EU, the U.S. is losing one of the more like-minded countries from the group in Brussels sitting on the other side of the negotiating table,‚Äù said Bown, a former World Bank economist. However, Lee-Makiyama, who also sees little chance of a deal before 2018, said Britain‚Äôs departure could eliminate one source of disagreement because the UK has insisted on a financial services chapter in the trade deal. ‚ÄúThe only real proponent of banking regulation in TTIP is the UK. Germany and France are probably willing to let it go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt still leaves about 20 outstanding issues at nearly the same level of difficulty.‚Äù The TTIP negotiations, which started three years ago, have unable to settle major differences over agriculture, where the EU side has shown little willingness to alter food safety rules that prohibit American beef raised with hormones or genetically modified foods, or open its closely guarded geographical food naming rules, such as for Asiago and feta cheeses. European negotiators have complained that the United States has offered too little to open up its vast federal, state and local government procurement markets to European vendors with ‚ÄúBuy American‚Äù preferences in place. Europe also wants access to key U.S. sectors such as maritime transport and aviation, while American negotiators have been frustrated over lack of access to some 200 European sectors ranging from healthcare to education. The two sides also are far apart on how to resolve disputes. The U.S. side favors a traditional binding arbitration approach, while the Europeans want a court-like system that allows for appeals. More progress has been made on harmonizing regulations for things like car seat belt anchors, clothes labeling and pharmaceutical inspections. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "

"For Donald Trump, going on about golf is par for the course","TURNBERRY, Scotland (Reuters) - Donald Trump flew all night from New York to Scotland to talk about his renovated Turnberry golf course and, given the chance to open up on the topic, he was rhapsodic. At a news conference, the Republican‚Äôs opening ode to Turnberry was what greeted American cable TV viewers as they woke to the news that Britain had voted to part ways with the European Union. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee talked plenty about the ‚ÄúBrexit‚Äù vote.  But since his event was to mark the reopening of a resort where the Open Championship has been staged four times, he first reviewed the improvements at holes 9, 10 and 11, the sprinkler system, the lighthouse, the resort hotel, and he name-checked golf legends Tom Watson, Jack Nicklaus and Nick Price. ‚ÄúThis hole is an example,‚Äù said Trump, standing on the 9th tee. ‚ÄúFrom approximately this area, you would hit over there ... Now you‚Äôre hitting out over the ocean. And just to the right of the lighthouse, you have a green, and a lot of people think this will be the greatest par 3 anywhere in the world. And then 10 becomes a par 5,‚Äù he said. Trump quickly dispensed with a protester who emerged from the audience to hold up a package of red golf balls emblazoned with Nazi swastikas. ‚ÄúGet him out of here,‚Äù Trump said, a refrain that he frequently uses when protesters are escorted by security from his rallies back home. More appreciated by Trump were the two bagpipers in kilts who accompanied him. Everyone at his event knew he was about to arrive because they could hear the skirling of the pipes before he appeared from behind a grassy hill. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just waiting on Donald Trump. His arrival is imminent. We can see the bagpipers,‚Äù said one TV broadcaster. Having never held public office, Trump does not have a list of political victories to tout on the campaign trail.

Bipartisan U.S. House members vow to keep gun control fight alive,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Friday pledged to build support in the U.S. House of Representatives for legislation keeping firearms from people on terrorism watch lists, despite repeated gun control failures this week in Congress. The ‚ÄúTerrorist Firearms Prevention Act‚Äù was introduced by nine House members representing diverse states stretching from Hawaii to Delaware, including some who have led the gun control fight for years. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt get on a plane because of the danger that may pose, there is no reason you should be able to purchase a dangerous weapon,‚Äù said Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, in a refrain that has ricocheted through the U.S. Capitol since the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando. The legislation, identical to a bill by Senator Susan Collins of Maine that was debated on the Senate floor on Thursday, would halt sales of weapons to people on a ‚Äúno-fly‚Äù list barring them from boarding airplanes, or a ‚ÄúSelectee‚Äù list in which they are subjected to special airport screenings. Over the past two weeks, the Senate failed to advance this or several other proposals placing new constraints on gun sales, as the U.S. mourned the deaths of 49 people killed at an Orlando nightclub with 53 others injured. Curbelo said he met with House Speaker Paul Ryan‚Äôs top aide to inform him of the bill. The lawmaker left that meeting with no assurances it would advance, but simply ‚Äúno objection from the speaker‚Äôs office‚Äù to the legislation being introduced, Curbelo said. He added that the bill‚Äôs sponsors now must build support ‚Äúamongst our colleagues‚Äù in a House that has a concentration of conservative Republicans opposed to most gun control ideas. Many Republicans have argued that travelers can mistakenly be placed on terrorism watch lists and denying them the ability to buy weapons would stomp on their constitutional rights. ‚ÄúWe cannot let that argument stop, into perpetuity, our ability to advance wise legislation in this matter,‚Äù countered    Republican Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia. Rigell, a co-sponsor of the bill, introduced himself to reporters at a press conference as a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, which lobbies against gun controls,  and an owner of 10 firearms, including an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that is similar to the weapon used by Omar Mateen, the Orlando shooter.

"Trump's ""unlimited"" wealth may not be enough to fund his campaign","LONDON (Reuters) - New York real estate developer Donald Trump says he has ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù personal wealth to fund his White House run, but a Reuters review of his financial disclosures suggests he does not have enough cash to see his campaign through to Election Day. Trump this week dismissed concerns about his campaign finances after electoral filings showed he raised just $3 million in individual contributions in May and had a war chest of only $1 million at the end of the month. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, raised $26 million and ended May with a war chest of $42 million.  Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee who says he is worth about $10 billion, said in a statement on Tuesday that ‚Äúif need be, there could be unlimited ‚Äòcash on hand‚Äô as I would put up my own money.‚Äù  Trump had cash and other liquid investments - money in funds, equities and cash - worth $60 million to $180 million in May, according to his filings with the Office of Government Ethics. The form does not require candidates to give precise values for their assets, only ranges. If President Barack Obama‚Äôs spending in his successful re-election bid in 2012 election is any guide, then Trump is a few hundred million dollars short. Obama spent almost $600 million between June and November 2012, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Trump‚Äôs campaign declined to comment for this story but referred to his earlier statement, in which he said his White House bid costs less than a traditional one because it is ‚Äúleaner and more efficient.‚Äù  If Trump did decide to self-finance his campaign, he could, in theory, tap the hundreds of millions dollars of revenue he says is generated annually by his businesses. But it‚Äôs not clear how much of this revenue he could use. Business owners can take money out of a business only after deducting operating costs and taxes. Even then, much of an entrepreneur‚Äôs corporate earnings are often used to invest in building their businesses and maintaining their property assets.  Trump‚Äôs liquid assets stood at $80 million to $230 million in July last year, according to an earlier electoral filing. Using the midpoint of the ranges, Trump‚Äôs liquid assets have fallen¬†$35 million in the past year.  The drop shows his campaign spending so far has already been funded in part by dipping into savings, rather than solely from his income. ‚ÄúThere is a real question about how much he has in terms of liquid assets,‚Äù said Norman Ornstein, a political scholar and expert in political finance at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, citing the regulatory filings, which do not give a precise picture of Trump‚Äôs wealth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite possible that he doesn‚Äôt have anywhere near what he suggests he has and what he does have is tied up in real estate, and selling that is no easy task,‚Äù he said.  As a result, a more likely scenario would be Trump trying to borrow the funds, which could be probably done more quickly than trying to sell one of his buildings, he added.  Jan Baran, a former general counsel with the Republican National Committee, said Trump may not need as much money as people think. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs breaking the mold on everything ... he has proven that spending large sums of money does not guarantee success,‚Äù Baran said, referring to how Trump defeated well-funded Republican rivals such as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the early nominating contests, or primaries. If Trump does not use his own money, he can seek donations, the traditional fund-raising route. Individual donors can contribute $2,700 each to his general election campaign. Trump has also signed a joint fundraising agreement with the  Republican National Committee. The RNC currently has $20 million in cash, money that will be used to help elect Trump and Republican lawmakers across the country.  Trump could also benefit if external groups like Super PACs raise money to campaign on his behalf. However, Trump has not yet blessed a Super PAC. Trump has spent around $63 million so far in his presidential bid, including $46 million in loans he made to his campaign, FERC data shows.  Typically, television advertising and creating infrastructure at a state and local level to mobilize voters are the most expensive aspects of a U.S. presidential campaign. TV networks charge high fees for prime time slots and many ground troops needed to bring out the voters must be paid.  So far Trump has not needed to spend much on television advertising - his fiery rhetoric on illegal immigrants and what he says are the security risks posed by refugees from the Middle East have guaranteed him blanket media coverage.  Daniel Weiner, a campaign finance expert at New York University‚Äôs Brennan Center for Justice said you can get only so far with free media in an election. ‚ÄúTV advertising has been decreasing in importance for a long time, but the get-out-the vote stuff is crucial, particularly in an election that people perceive as being more about motivating their core voters, as opposed to winning over swing voters. And what we call ‚Äòthe ground game‚Äô is quite expensive,‚Äù he said. Trump has said he plans to outsource some of that ground game to the RNC, for example relying on their field staff in battleground states to help get out the vote. Trump has significant real estate holdings, which he says have low debt on them. With Election Day on Nov. 8 now just four months away, some real estate experts say selling them to generate cash would be a challenge. But several bankers say Trump could conceivably borrow hundreds of millions against them, despite his history of business bankruptcies and litigation with lenders. Exactly how much he could borrow, how easily and at what interest rates depends on how much Trump owns of the buildings that he cites as his own and how much debt he has. ‚ÄúYou have years of prosperity and you have all of these alternative lenders and you have banks that are hungry for loans,‚Äù said one veteran banking executive, who was not permitted to speak on the record.‚Äù If Trump needs to borrow tens of millions of dollars, he probably can, the executive said. ‚ÄúIf it is hundreds of millions, that‚Äôs another matter.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 "
"Cleveland, ACLU agree on protest limits at Republican convention","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The city of Cleveland and the American Civil Liberties Union on Friday settled a federal lawsuit over free speech limits outside the Republican National Convention next month, setting the stage for lively demonstrations during Donald Trump‚Äôs big moment. The city had been seeking a restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the Quicken Loans Arena, site of the convention, where free speech and mobility would be limited. That prompted an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of three protest groups that argued the so-called event zone was too large and the security regulations too strict. Details of the new event zone and protest rules were not immediately available. ‚ÄúToday, counsel advised me that the case is settled and that they will execute a settlement agreement expeditiously,‚Äù U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster said in a statement. Another judge on Thursday had struck down Cleveland‚Äôs plan for placing limits on protests, issuing a preliminary injunction in favor of the ACLU and referring the case to Polster for mediation. Trump is expected to become the Republican Party‚Äôs official nominee for president at the July 18-21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside. Trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations with some resulting in clashes between the candidate‚Äôs supporters and opponents. The plaintiffs in the Cleveland lawsuit are Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the wealthy businessman‚Äôs campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization. Citizens for Trump anticipates 104 cars and trucks, 100 motorcycles, four horses and at least 5,000 people to participate in its event, while Organize Ohio expects 3,000 to 5,000 marchers, the ACLU said.

"Ryan, House Republicans offer plan to slice U.S. tax rates","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Friday  they would advance legislation next year to chop individual and corporate U.S. tax rates. The tax plan, unveiled by House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol, is the sixth and final plank of a conservative policy agenda being rolled out in an effort to unify Republicans after a divisive primary campaign for the party‚Äôs presidential nominee. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican, said the proposal would provide a clear direction for U.S. economic leadership and was needed amid global uncertainty that was exemplified by the British vote to leave the European Union. ‚ÄúFor all of these moments of possible uncertainty that are happening around the globe, having strong, powerful, confident, American economic leadership is in need, and this does that,‚Äù he said. Washington has been unable to summon the political will to reform the loophole-riddled tax code for nearly three decades. Overhauling the code has long been a goal of Ryan, a self-described policy wonk. He was considered the Republican Party‚Äôs leading voice on taxes and budgets before he ascended to the job of speaker last year. But the labor powerhouse AFL-CIO scorned the Republican blueprint as similar to a tax-cutting proposal made last year by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who Ryan recently endorsed. Ryan and Trump ‚Äúhave striking resemblance - both tax plans benefit the wealthy & corps a lot,‚Äù the AFL-CIO said on Twitter.  Trump‚Äôs ideas about taxes have appeared contradictory at times. He said in May he is open to raising taxes on the rich, backing off prior proposals to reduce taxes on all Americans and corporations by slashing rates even more deeply than Ryan and House Republicans would. Democrats, including presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, have pressed for increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans for years. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the Republican plan as ‚Äúmassive tax giveaways to millionaires and billionaires on the backs of hard-working American families.‚Äù The plan would consolidate the current seven tax brackets for individuals to three, and lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, higher than the 25 percent that Ryan proposed when he chaired the House Budget Committee.  Ryan said the goal was to make things so simple the average American could do their taxes on a postcard. The plan would lead to a maximum tax rate of 25 percent on small business income. It would also lower the top U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world, to 20 percent, as well as shift to a ‚Äúterritorial‚Äù style tax system aimed at exempting the earnings of American companies abroad from U.S. taxation. The blueprint also calls for overhauling the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, an idea that animates many conservatives who have called for its abolition. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "

White House unveils measures to help inmates find work after prison,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday rolled out a series of education and work training initiatives focused on helping convicted criminals avoid returning to prison, part of President Barack Obama‚Äôs legacy-shaping effort to overhaul the U.S. criminal justice system as he prepares to leave office. The measures include a program that will link 67 colleges and universities with 141 correctional facilities to provide education and training to about 12,000 inmates. The program will offer federal Pell grants to prisoners, with an emphasis on inmates set to be released within five years of starting classes. ‚ÄúThe bottom line is that our communities are less safe when the stigma of incarceration prevents Americans from truly ever shedding their prison jumpsuit,‚Äù White House senior adviser  Valerie Jarrett said on a call with reporters. ‚ÄúWhen people leave prisons and can‚Äôt turn their lives around, they too often end up back behind bars,‚Äù she said. Other programs unveiled on Friday will offer $31 million in grants for organizations to offer occupational training and apprenticeship opportunities for young adults and more than $5 million to organizations that help inmates prepare for employment. Obama‚Äôs top cabinet members for justice, education, labor and housing praised the reentry initiatives as common-sense reforms that should have been in place long ago. ‚ÄúAll the little things that people take for granted generate tremendous obstacles for people who are coming out of the criminal justice system,‚Äù Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a panel hosted by the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank. Obtaining photo identification or being considered for job opportunities were two examples. ‚ÄúIn order to compete, you have to be allowed in the arena,‚Äù she added.

Jarrett said the White House remains hopeful that criminal justice reform will be approved by lawmakers. ‚ÄúWe would like to see those bills move forward as quickly as possible,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are going to do everything we can to work with members on both sides of the aisle to make sure it comes to fruition.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "
Donald Trump heads for Scotland to reopen a golf resort,"GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Most U.S. presidential candidates go abroad to sharpen their foreign policy credentials. Donald Trump arrives in Scotland on Friday to reopen a golf resort. The presumptive Republican nominee, 70, visits his family‚Äôs ancestral homeland to showcase his far-flung business empire. His mother was born on Scotland‚Äôs Isle of Lewis. With a throng of reporters watching, he will make a dramatic arrival by helicopter at his seaside Trump Turnberry resort. He has scheduled a news conference on the 9th hole at noon (7 a.m. ET/1100 GMT). His visit to Turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in Aberdeen on Saturday, will allow him to comment on the outcome of Britain‚Äôs vote on Thursday on whether to remain in the European Union. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think opening a golf resort gets you many foreign policy chops,‚Äù said Saul Anuzis, former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ‚ÄúBut since he‚Äôs there right in the middle of the EU vote, it may end up being a PR bonanza for him.‚Äù The risk is that the real-estate tycoon, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of Americans in an opinion poll, will make a foreign policy misstep at a time when Republican leaders are urging a more serious demeanor. Trump has said he would be inclined to leave the EU. He has exchanged insults with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has called the New Yorker‚Äôs anti-immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. There are no plans for the two to meet. His trip has baffled Republican officials who say he should concentrate on strengthening his campaign and taking the fight to the presumptive Democratic nominee, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is 68. Trump defeated a crowded field of opponents for the Republican nomination but has faced one controversy after another, the latest over his firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention. ‚ÄúHis campaign has got all kinds of growing pains and it doesn‚Äôt make sense that he would spend any kind of time going out of the country,‚Äù said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.  Turnberry is a storied course where the Open Championship has been staged four times. Trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on Scotland‚Äôs West Coast 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Glasgow. He has portrayed his determination to build up courses in Turnberry and Aberdeen and overcome local opposition as an example of the type of leadership skills that Americans would get if he wins the White House on Nov. 8. ‚ÄúWell, Scotland has already been won ‚Äì and so will the United States,‚Äù Trump wrote in a column for The Press and Journal newspaper in Aberdeen. An Aberdeen family opposed to his development there has threatened to raise a Mexican flag as a reminder of his proposal to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to keep out immigrants who enter illegally.

Immigration win for Republicans could help Clinton in the end,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans cheered after the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday thwarted President Barack Obama‚Äôs plan to offer millions of undocumented immigrants relief from deportation, but any sense of triumph might last only until the November presidential election.  If recent history is a guide, the stalled cause of immigration reform could energize Hispanic voters in support of likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, hurting Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs chances of reaching the White House.  Four years ago, Obama, seeking reelection to a second term, made Republican opposition to reform a central theme of his campaign. He ended up swamping his opponent, Mitt Romney, by almost a 3 to 1 margin among Latino voters, who now make up around 12 percent of the U.S. electorate. Republican hopes for securing a larger share of that vote this election already seemed grim given Trump‚Äôs vow to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally and to build a wall along the southern U.S. border.  Democrats were quick to assail the ruling and voice concern about the fate of the 4 million or so immigrants who were to be shielded from deportation by Obama‚Äôs executive action. But it was also clear that they believe the high court has handed them a potent weapon to spur Latinos ‚Äî the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. electorate ‚Äî to vote in greater numbers. The Latino voting bloc is expected to swell to 27.3 million in 2016, up 4 million from 4 years ago.  The prospect of Clinton filling the current vacancy on the top court with a liberal-leading justice who could, potentially, protect immigration-reform programs, may galvanize those voters as well. Republicans in Congress have refused to accept Obama‚Äôs pick for the top court to fill the vacancy left by the death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia in February.  The justices‚Äô ruling on Thursday sent the question of the legality of Obama‚Äôs program back to a Texas federal court for trial, leaving open the possibility that the matter could return to the high court on appeal at a later date.  The court‚Äôs decision ‚Äújust adds fuel to the fire that‚Äôs already raging,‚Äù said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist. ‚ÄúEach of these events raises the intensity and the Latino turnout even more.‚Äù In the wake of the ruling, immigration activists vowed payback in November‚Äôs election and staged protests on Thursday. A recent survey by Latino Decisions, a polling firm, showed that about half of the U.S. Hispanic electorate showed greater enthusiasm to vote in 2016 as compared to 2012, with support for Obama‚Äôs pro-immigrant executive orders running high.  ‚ÄúWe should expect similar dynamics this fall, perhaps even more so given the election is likely to determine the ideological direction of the Supreme Court,‚Äù said David Damore, an analyst for the firm. Given Trump‚Äôs unpopularity with Latino voters, the question for many Democrats both in and outside the Clinton campaign has been less about attracting the bloc‚Äôs support and more about making sure it votes in large enough numbers to help offset Trump‚Äôs expected advantage among white voters.  The court‚Äôs decision may also help make traditionally Republican states with increasing Hispanic populations such as Arizona more competitive this election, strategists in both parties said.  Reed Galen, a Republican strategist in California, said the ruling could boost Democratic hopes in Latino-heavy battleground states such as Nevada, Colorado, and Florida.  ‚ÄúThe issue isn‚Äôt getting [Latino voters] fired up,‚Äù Galen said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting them to show up.‚Äù Galen believes there is little his party can do now to mitigate the damage he believes Trump has done to its appeal among Hispanics. A Republican National Committee ‚Äúautopsy‚Äù report after Romney‚Äôs defeat said it was essential for the party to broaden its appeal to Hispanic voters by embracing immigration reform.  ‚ÄúTrump has pushed the envelope on immigration so far for Republicans, I don‚Äôt know this [decision] is going to be any more damaging,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe barn‚Äôs already been blown up.‚Äù But Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, a conservative advocacy group, disagreed. He said Republicans in Congress could still enact reform this year, which would ward off Trump‚Äôs deportation threat while building stronger ties with Latino voters.  ‚ÄúThis is the quintessential green light for Republicans to put their money where their mouth is,‚Äù Rodriguez said.  Many Republicans were careful on Thursday to applaud the court‚Äôs ruling on the grounds that it curtailed what they viewed as an abuse of executive authority by Obama, without delving into the underlying immigration issues.  ‚ÄúThe Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws ‚Äî only Congress is,‚Äù said Paul Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Ryan supports comprehensive immigration reform. Trump, however, went further, praising the ruling and saying the election now held the key to blocking further illegal immigration.  ‚ÄúThe election, and the Supreme Court appointments that come with it will decide whether or not we have a border and, hence, a country,‚Äù he said in a statement. He has vowed to reverse Obama‚Äôs executive actions on immigration as president. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "

"Latest gun control bid falters in Congress, Democrat sit-in ends","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Another attempt at gun control faltered in the U.S. Congress on Thursday despite outrage at the Orlando massacre, as a proposed ban on firearms sales to people being monitored for links to terrorism barely avoided being killed in the Senate. In a procedural vote, the Senate narrowly rejected an attempt to scrap the plan by Republican Senator Susan Collins to prevent guns getting into the hands of people on two U.S. government terrorism watch lists.  But the proposal looked short of the support it would need to advance through the chamber, and Republican leaders said the Senate would switch from debating gun control to other matters until at least after the July 4 holiday.         It was the latest setback for proponents of gun restrictions who have been thwarted for years on Capitol Hill by gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association.     Frequent efforts at gun control have failed despite anger at mass shootings like the killings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and in San Bernardino, California, last year.  ‚ÄúEventually this problem will get addressed again one of two ways: We find a breakthrough, which I will seek, or there will be another terrorist attack which will bring us right back to this issue. I hope we can do it without another terrorist attack,‚Äù said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who supported Collins.        A few hours earlier, Democratic lawmakers ended a sit-in protest in the House of Representatives over guns. Fueled by Chinese food and pizzas, dozens of them stayed on the House floor all night, at times bursting into the civil rights anthem ‚ÄúWe Shall Overcome‚Äù¬†before giving up their protest after 25 hours.¬†¬†¬†      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a struggle that lasts for one day, or one week, or one month, or one year,‚Äù said Representative John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia and a key figure in the civil rights protests of the 1960s. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to win the struggle,‚Äù said Lewis, who led the House sit-in. ¬†¬†¬† Dramatic protests by legislators are rare in the U.S. Capitol and the sit-in underscored how sensitive the gun control issue became after this month‚Äôs Florida attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Opinion polls show Americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than 310 million weapons, about one for every citizen.      After a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, some senators had seen resistance to gun restrictions softening because the issue had partly become one of national security. But Collins‚Äô measure received only 52 votes in the 100-seat Senate test vote, short of the 60 votes that would be needed for  approval in future Senate procedural votes.  While her plan could be revived next month, it is unclear if she has the momentum to overcome pro-gun rights forces in Congress who argue that gun control measures in Congress have been too restrictive and trample on the constitutional right to bear arms. Four other gun control measures failed earlier this week.              Collins, a Maine lawmaker, wants to forbid gun sales to anyone on the U.S. government‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo Fly List‚Äù for terrorism suspects or the ‚ÄúSelectee List‚Äù of people who receive extra security screening at airports.         Despite the lack of legislation, the gun debate has stirred passions. The House Democrats‚Äô sit-in brought an outpouring of grass-roots activity.  Jennifer Hoppe, deputy director of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said that in less than 24 hours from Wednesday, about 130,000 calls were made from supporters of gun control to members of Congress. First lady Michelle Obama backed the House Democrats‚Äô protest. ‚ÄúWe have grieved for too many children and wept for too many families after shootings. Chicago. Tucson. Newtown. Charleston. Orlando. #Enough,‚Äù she wrote on Twitter on Thursday. The Democrats were seeking votes on legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases, as well as measures to curb the sale of weapons to people on government watch lists             Republicans allied with the NRA gun rights group say that while they want to combat terrorism, they represent constituents who believe firmly in the constitutional right to bear arms.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tough issue. For people like myself, who come from a hunting and fishing state, it‚Äôs pretty hard,‚Äù said Senator Orrin Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who voted against Collins.

Obama dined for more than two hours, departing shortly after British networks called the referendum for the ‚Äúleave‚Äù campaign, and markets plunged. A White House official said Obama had been briefed on the returns and would ‚Äúcontinue to be updated by his team as the situation warrants.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe expect the president will have an opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Cameron over the course of the next day, and we will release further comment as soon as appropriate,‚Äù the official said in a brief statement to reporters. Obama traveled to London in April at the request of Cameron, whom he calls a friend, exhorting Britons to stay in the EU, an unusual intervention that was denounced as meddling by those in the ‚Äúleave‚Äù campaign. Obama also warned that leaving the EU would put Britain at the ‚Äúback of the queue‚Äù for a trade deal with the United States. Obama‚Äôs term in the White House ends on Jan. 20, 2017. His former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 election, had also said she hoped the UK would stay in the EU. The presumptive Republican nominee - real estate magnate Donald Trump - had taken the opposite stance, saying he thought the UK should leave. Trump, in Scotland on Friday to reopen a golf resort, told reporters that Britons ‚Äútook back control of their country‚Äù by voting to leave the European Union. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 "
Democrat gun control sit-in sparks social media sensation,"(Reuters) - A blackout of television cameras in the U.S. House Representatives during the Democrats‚Äô gun control sit-in may have spurred public interest in the protest as it forced the demonstrators to use social media to broadcast their message. Democrats leapt on Facebook Live and Twitter‚Äôs Periscope after the cameras, controlled by the House, went dark Wednesday when presiding House officer and Republican Representative Ted Poe declared the chamber not in order during the protest. As Democrats took to alternative forms of video broadcasting, their message gained tremendous momentum from social media. On Twitter, the hashtags #NoBillNoBreak and #HoldTheFloor have been tweeted at least 1.4 million times. Of the roughly 20 members of Congress who remained at the sit-in overnight, 19 of them used Facebook Live for a total combined viewership of 3 million. ‚ÄúIt really connected with people out there,‚Äù Congressman Scott Peters told Reuters. ‚ÄúThis whole phenomenon with [live video] struck a nerve.‚Äù Peters used the application Periscope, which is connected to the social media platform Twitter, to send out video. ‚ÄúWithout that, think about it, it would have been a caucus meeting where we talk to ourselves,‚Äù he added.  In remarks Wednesday outside the Capitol, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi praised how her party harnessed social media. ‚ÄúWithout you and without the technology of Periscope [the sit-in] would just be a debate in the Halls of Congress unrecorded because they turned off the microphones,‚Äù Pelosi said. ‚ÄúBut we raised our voices.¬†They turned off the cameras and we went to Periscope.‚Äù Congressman Mark Takano, who began posting live videos from the chamber to his Facebook page Wednesday afternoon and continued to throughout the night, said the social media video helped him connect with constituents. ‚ÄúOnce I got started with the live streaming I didn‚Äôt feel like I could let down the people who were following me,‚Äù said Takano. ‚ÄúIt was a way to push out a message.‚Äù Even C-SPAN, which typically broadcasts footage recorded by the House cameras, picked up live video from four different members of Congress roughly two hours after the House cameras shut down, according to communications director Howard Mortman. It marked the first time the channel broadcast a live social media feed from the House floor. ‚ÄúSomething interesting is happening with Facebook Live that‚Äôs bringing more openness to the political process,‚Äù said Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, in a post to his social media profile Thursday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a way to share anything you want with the world using just your phone.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 "
Democrats say gun defeat in Congress could help on campaign trail,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in Congress ended a 25-hour sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives where they have been countless times before: short of the votes needed to tighten U.S. gun laws. But many see their latest defeat as a prelude to victory in the Nov. 8 elections. Spurred by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, Democrats are showing a new willingness to make gun laws a top issue in Washington and on the campaign trail, defying powerful lobbying groups like the National Rifle Association that have helped make the United States the most gun-friendly country in the developed world. The effort is not likely to change federal firearms laws this year, as Republicans who control Congress have shown little interest in proposals that they say weaken Americans‚Äô constitutional right to bear arms. But Democrats and their allies say that defeat now on Capitol Hill could help them win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in the Nov. 8 elections. That is a shift from previous elections when Democrats have downplayed the issue on the campaign trail. ‚ÄúThe tide has turned, and Republicans ignore this issue at their own peril,‚Äù said Robert Weiner, a former Democratic congressional aide.  Hillary Clinton, the Democrats‚Äô presumptive presidential nominee, talks frequently in her campaign about banning military-style assault rifles and expanding background checks ‚Äî a marked contrast to President Barack Obama, who avoided talk of guns during his 2008 and 2012 elections. In Congress, Democrats have resorted to confrontational tactics to force gun votes since June 12, when a gunman killed 49 people at a Florida nightclub. Senator Chris Murphy‚Äôs 15-hour speech in the Senate last week forced five votes this week on measures that would make it harder for terrorism suspects to buy guns, though none have advanced. In the House, Democrats occupied the chamber for 25 hours in an unsuccessful attempt to force votes on terrorism suspects and expanding background checks for gun buyers. Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway said Democrats‚Äô willingness to talk about guns reflects the party becoming more liberal, not a change in public sentiment.  Most voters view the shooting in Orlando as an act of terrorism inspired by Islamic State, she said. ‚ÄúThe shooter called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, he did not call 911 and pledge allegiance to Smith & Wesson,‚Äù she said, referring to an acronym for Islamic State and the firearms manufacturer. Still, Democrats‚Äô willingness to take a stand on gun control has shifted the debate, said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a potentially a good electoral outcome for Democrats out of this. They will probably pick up seats,‚Äù he said. After landslide defeats in 2010 and 2014, most Democrats who remain in office tend to represent safely liberal congressional districts where gun control is popular. But those up for election in competitive states have spoken up as well. U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who hopes to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio in gun-friendly Florida, said during the House sit-in that gun rights groups like the NRA are ‚Äúlargely responsible‚Äù for the country‚Äôs 32,000 annual gun deaths.  ‚ÄúThis passion you‚Äôre seeing is what‚Äôs needed to get people to wake up,‚Äù he said on the House floor. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. Democrats have public opinion on their side: a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted this week found that 48 percent of those surveyed support strong gun regulations, while 23 percent support minimal rules. Support runs higher for specific proposals, like imposing background checks on all gun buyers. (bit.ly/28U7CA7) But intensity has been a sticking point for gun control advocates. The NRA has been able to mobilize supporters who are willing to vote for or against a candidate solely because of their position on guns, while gun-control supporters typically consider other issues as well, such as abortion and the environment. ‚ÄúAnytime the Democrats start a gun movement, it costs them votes,‚Äù said Dave ‚ÄúMudcat‚Äù Saunders, who has worked for centrist Democratic candidates. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs changing.‚Äù Shootings in Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; Charleston, South Carolina; and, most recently, Orlando have changed that dynamic, others say.  ‚ÄúMass shootings are highly visible, and force people to pay attention and realize that we have a problem that isn‚Äôt going to be solved by more guns,‚Äù said Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist in Atlanta who worked on Obama‚Äôs 2012 campaign. The gun-control lobbying group Everytown for Gun Safety says its members generated 245,000 telephone calls to Congress, and brought hundreds of its members to Congress to press for action during the debate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in the fight for a number of years and I‚Äôve never seen anything like this,‚Äù said Colin Goddard, an advocate with the group who was wounded during the 2007 Virginia Tech mass shooting.

White House threatens to veto Republicans' Zika funding plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday threatened to veto the $1.1 billion approved by the U.S. House of Representatives to fight the Zika virus, blasting the measure for short-changing the administration‚Äôs $1.9 billion funding request. The Republican-controlled House approved the funding deal early Thursday morning after reaching a deal with both House and Senate Republicans. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the bill ‚Äúfalls far short‚Äù of the amount of money recommended by health officials to address the spread of the Zika virus. ‚ÄúThis is a bill that would steal money from other critically important public health priorities,‚Äù Schultz told reporters at a briefing. ‚ÄúWe urge Republicans to stop turning this into a political football, and to actually get to work to come up with proposals that will serve the American people.‚Äù The administration also criticized the bill for limiting contraception access for women seeking to prevent Zika, which can be spread through unprotected sex.  The Senate is expected to vote on funding to combat the Zika virus next week, but the bill faces an uncertain fate in the chamber, where the Democratic minority has more power to stop legislation. Democratic leader Harry Reid has declared his opposition. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan urged the Senate to move on the bill. ‚ÄúIt is a responsible plan that assures the administration will continue to have the needed resources to protect the public,‚Äù Ryan said. Republicans said the deal included funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.  If the Senate approved the bill, a White House veto would likely mean that lawmakers would not take up the issue until the House and Senate return from their July 4 holiday recess - well into the U.S. summer season. The House has already adjourned for holiday and the Senate is expected to start its recess next Friday.       Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to more Zika funding, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million that had been set aside to fight Ebola. House Democrats said they could not go along with the deal because of $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere that the Republicans want to use to pay for the Zika spending. Senate Democrats also voiced displeasure, clouding the outlook for it passing. ‚ÄúA narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off women‚Äôs access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus,‚Äù Reid said.  According to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, $543 million of the $1.1 billion would come from unspent funds set aside for implementing Obamacare in U.S. territories, while $107 million would come from unused funds to fight another virus, Ebola. Another $100 million would come from unused administrative funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 "
Clinton's server technician declines to answer court-ordered questions,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The computer technician who set up Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server for her work as U.S. secretary of state declined to answer questions more than 125 times during a deposition ordered by a federal judge, a transcript released on Thursday shows. Bryan Pagliano worked on Clinton‚Äôs previous presidential run in 2008. He joined the State Department‚Äôs technology department the next year as one of Clinton‚Äôs political appointees and set up the unauthorized server in her New York home.  The decision to set up the server has dogged Clinton, the presumptive Democratic Party candidate ahead of November‚Äôs presidential election, and clouded her campaign with legal uncertainty. A majority of voters say they find her dishonest, polls show, with many citing her private server as a reason. Judge Emmet Sullivan of the U.S. District Court in Washington had ordered Pagliano and other Clinton aides and department officials to give sworn testimony to help him decide whether the server was set up to thwart the public‚Äôs right to see government records.  Sullivan is overseeing a lawsuit by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group suing the State Department. It is one of scores of such lawsuits filed by individuals and groups who were incorrectly told by the government that Clinton had no emails before the arrangement became publicly known in 2015, two years after Clinton left the department. ‚ÄúOn the advice of counsel, I will decline to answer your question in reliance on my rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,‚Äù Pagliano said 128 times over 80 minutes in response to a series of questions by a Judicial Watch lawyer. The deposition under oath took place on Wednesday. The Fifth Amendment gives Americans the right not to be forced to be witnesses against themselves in criminal cases. Pagliano is cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice‚Äôs criminal inquiry on the server arrangement in exchange for a form of immunity from prosecution.  The inquiry, prompted by the discovery of classified government secrets among Clinton‚Äôs emails, has been underway for nearly a year. Investigators have interviewed several of Clinton‚Äôs senior aides. No one has been charged.  Clinton has repeatedly said the server was a mistake in hindsight and that she thought it was allowed, which department officials now say was not the case. She has said she does not believe she will be charged with breaking any laws. Her spokesmen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 "

Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas.  The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak: How do people become infected? Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. How do you treat Zika? There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization (WHO) had said it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at 1,434 through May 21 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation declined to 3,257. Colombia confirmed two cases of microcephaly linked to Zika. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. Cases of sexual transmission have also been reported, prompting health officials to advise use of condoms, or abstaining from sex, to prevent infection between partners. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 48 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (39): Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cura√ßao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is ‚Äúrelatively common‚Äù and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. All cases involve possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. The WHO has also identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  British health officials reported Zika was found in a man‚Äôs semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue. ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 "

Trump will not ask donors to repay nearly $50 million in campaign loans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump has forgiven nearly $50 million in loans he made to his presidential campaign, he said on Thursday, signaling to donors that future contributions will be used to fight Democrat Hillary Clinton and not to repay himself. The announcement that Trump will not seek repayment of the loans via contributions came amid concerns from his backers that he does not have enough money to fund his campaign for the Nov. 8 election. He had only $1.3 million in cash to start the month. ‚ÄúI have absolutely no intention of paying myself back for the nearly $50 million dollars I have loaned to the campaign,‚Äù the presumptive Republican nominee said in a statement. The New York developer has suggested he could use more of his personal wealth to help win the White House. ‚Äú(Trump) has also said he will contribute significantly more money,‚Äù Steve Mnuchin, the top fundraiser for Trump‚Äôs campaign, said in an interview on CNBC earlier on Thursday. Mnuchin was the first to say that Trump would forgive the loans. Although Trump has said he has ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù personal wealth to fund his White House run, a Reuters review of his financial disclosures suggests he does not have enough cash to see his campaign through to Election Day. Gaylord Hughey, a Texas-based fundraiser supporting Trump, called Trump‚Äôs decision to forgive the loans ‚Äúunprecedented.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think it indicates that he‚Äôs all in and he wants every dollar to be spent toward a successful campaign for the general election,‚Äù Hughey said. Hughey, who as a bundler collects donations from other supporters, said Trump was broadening the pool of donors in addition to gaining support from people who historically donate to Republicans.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had new folks come in as major donors unexpectedly,‚Äù Hughey said. Mnuchin also told CNBC that Trump had seen a strong uptick in fundraising in the past week. He said Trump raised about $10 million in conjunction with the Republican Party at fundraising events this week. Trump also raised $6 million through online donations, Mnuchin said, following the wealthy New York businessman‚Äôs first attempt to appeal to supporters to contribute to his campaign. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve really ramped up the effort this month,‚Äù Mnuchin said.  Supporters began worrying on Monday after Trump‚Äôs campaign revealed weak fundraising totals. He began June far behind Clinton, who had a $42 million war chest to start the month. Candidates need a hefty bank account to fund a presidential bid, including hundreds of millions of dollars for television advertising and staff. Trump has benefited from extensive media coverage but could be buried in attack ads if he lacks the funds to push his own message. Mnuchin said Trump‚Äôs numbers at the beginning of June were ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù because his fundraising efforts for the general election only started recently.  Trump funded his campaign for the Republican nomination largely through his own personal wealth, putting money into his campaign in the form of loans. By leaving them as loans, he would be entitled to seek repayment from his campaign. By converting the loans into contributions, Trump is telling his supporters he will not seek repayment via contributions. There are no legal limits on how much candidates can contribute to their own campaigns, in contrast to caps on how much an individual, company or group can give. Trump only began fundraising in earnest at the end of May. His campaign has said that donations have been ‚Äúpouring in‚Äù since he started seeking contributions.  On Tuesday, Trump attended a dinner fundraiser in Manhattan, where the attendees included billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital and hedge fund manager John Paulson. Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets football team, hosted a breakfast fundraiser for Trump at a restaurant in the city. Trump‚Äôs campaign was working to quickly raise large sums via a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee and several state Republican parties.  A presidential candidate can only accept up to $5,400 from an individual donor. The joint fundraising agreement allows Trump to accept checks as high as $450,000. The donations are then divided up between the campaign and the state funds.

U.S. Senate advances compromise gun control measure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday advanced a compromise gun control plan to stop people on some terrorism watch lists from buying guns, in the wake of the June 12th mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. While the measure, spearheaded by Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, cleared one procedural hurdle, it was not clear if the Senate would move further ahead on it. Passing the bill in the House of Representatives could also be an uphill battle.  ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 "
"Latest gun control bid falters in Congress, Democrat sit-in ends","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Another attempt at gun control faltered in the U.S. Congress on Thursday despite outrage at the Orlando massacre, as a proposed ban on firearms sales to people being monitored for links to terrorism barely avoided being killed in the Senate. In a procedural vote, the Senate narrowly rejected an attempt to scrap the plan by Republican Senator Susan Collins to prevent guns getting into the hands of people on two U.S. government terrorism watch lists.  But the proposal looked short of the support it would need to advance through the chamber, and Republican leaders said the Senate would switch from debating gun control to other matters until at least after the July 4 holiday.         It was the latest setback for proponents of gun restrictions who have been thwarted for years on Capitol Hill by gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association.     Frequent efforts at gun control have failed despite anger at mass shootings like the killings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and in San Bernardino, California, last year.  ‚ÄúEventually this problem will get addressed again one of two ways: We find a breakthrough, which I will seek, or there will be another terrorist attack which will bring us right back to this issue. I hope we can do it without another terrorist attack,‚Äù said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who supported Collins.        A few hours earlier, Democratic lawmakers ended a sit-in protest in the House of Representatives over guns. Fueled by Chinese food and pizzas, dozens of them stayed on the House floor all night, at times bursting into the civil rights anthem ‚ÄúWe Shall Overcome‚Äù¬†before giving up their protest after 25 hours.¬†¬†¬†      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a struggle that lasts for one day, or one week, or one month, or one year,‚Äù said Representative John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia and a key figure in the civil rights protests of the 1960s. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to win the struggle,‚Äù said Lewis, who led the House sit-in. ¬†¬†¬† Dramatic protests by legislators are rare in the U.S. Capitol and the sit-in underscored how sensitive the gun control issue became after this month‚Äôs Florida attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Opinion polls show Americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than 310 million weapons, about one for every citizen.      After a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, some senators had seen resistance to gun restrictions softening because the issue had partly become one of national security. But Collins‚Äô measure received only 52 votes in the 100-seat Senate test vote, short of the 60 votes that would be needed for  approval in future Senate procedural votes.  While her plan could be revived next month, it is unclear if she has the momentum to overcome pro-gun rights forces in Congress who argue that gun control measures in Congress have been too restrictive and trample on the constitutional right to bear arms. Four other gun control measures failed earlier this week.              Collins, a Maine lawmaker, wants to forbid gun sales to anyone on the U.S. government‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo Fly List‚Äù for terrorism suspects or the ‚ÄúSelectee List‚Äù of people who receive extra security screening at airports.         Despite the lack of legislation, the gun debate has stirred passions. The House Democrats‚Äô sit-in brought an outpouring of grass-roots activity.  Jennifer Hoppe, deputy director of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said that in less than 24 hours from Wednesday, about 130,000 calls were made from supporters of gun control to members of Congress. First lady Michelle Obama backed the House Democrats‚Äô protest. ‚ÄúWe have grieved for too many children and wept for too many families after shootings. Chicago. Tucson. Newtown. Charleston. Orlando. #Enough,‚Äù she wrote on Twitter on Thursday. The Democrats were seeking votes on legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases, as well as measures to curb the sale of weapons to people on government watch lists             Republicans allied with the NRA gun rights group say that while they want to combat terrorism, they represent constituents who believe firmly in the constitutional right to bear arms.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tough issue. For people like myself, who come from a hunting and fishing state, it‚Äôs pretty hard,‚Äù said Senator Orrin Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who voted against Collins.

Republican lawmakers approve $1.1 billion in new Zika funds,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday agreed to $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus, short-changing President Barack Obama‚Äôs $1.9 billion funding request and angering Democrats by making other cuts to pay for it. The House approved a funding deal that had been agreed to on Wednesday by Republicans from both the House and Senate. But the bill‚Äôs future was uncertain in the Senate, where the Democratic minority has more power to stop legislation, and Democratic leader Harry Reid has declared his opposition. ‚ÄúIt is a responsible plan that assures the administration will continue to have the needed resources to protect the public,‚Äù Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Republicans said the deal included funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.  But the White House said the allocation fell short.  ‚ÄúThis plan from congressional Republicans is four months late and nearly a billion dollars short of what our public health experts have said is necessary to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus, and steals funding from other health priorities,‚Äù White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement before the House voted. Earnest said the Republican plan would limit needed birth control services for women seeking to prevent Zika, which can be spread through unprotected sex ‚Äî ‚Äúa clear indication they don‚Äôt take seriously the threat from the Zika virus.‚Äù  Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to more Zika funding, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million that had been set aside to fight Ebola. House Democrats said they could not go along with the deal because of $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere that the Republicans want to use to pay for the Zika spending.  Senate Democrats also voiced displeasure, clouding the outlook for it passing. ‚ÄúA narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off women‚Äôs access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus,‚Äù Reid said.  Still, Ryan urged the Senate to move on the bill.  According to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, $543 million of the $1.1 billion would come from unspent funds set aside for implementing Obamacare in U.S. territories, while $107 million would come from unused funds to fight another virus, Ebola. Another $100 million would come from unused administrative funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 "

House Democrats broadcast 'sit-in' on social media after cameras shut down,"(Reuters) - Democrats demanding action on gun control turned to Twitter‚Äôs Periscope and Facebook‚Äôs live video platform to broadcast their ‚Äúsit-in‚Äù on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday after the chamber‚Äôs cameras shut down. Representative Scott Peters of California told Reuters he downloaded the online video platform Periscope from the House floor after it became clear that chamber cameras were not operating.  ‚ÄúThanks to them, the American people got to look in on and listen to what is taking place this floor,‚Äù U.S. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina said in praise of the platform. The protest was the latest move by Democrats to persuade the Republican majority in Congress to take up votes on gun control measures in response to last week‚Äôs mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, the deadliest in modern U.S. history. ‚ÄúThe speaker (Paul Ryan) controls the cameras,‚Äù Peters said. ‚ÄúWe noticed that over lunch, he turned them off - allowed them to be turned off.‚Äù A spokesman for Twitter said that tweets from Peters‚Äô account containing the Periscope footage had been viewed over 800,000 times as of Wednesday night. Ryan‚Äôs spokesman, AshLee Strong, said in a statement:     ‚ÄúThe House cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the House has recessed subject to the call of the chair.‚Äù At about noon EDT, presiding House officer and Republican Representative Ted Poe declared the House not in order, as Democratic protesters sat at the front of the chamber. Cable news channel C-SPAN, which typically uses the House cameras to broadcast live footage of Congress, broadcast Peters‚Äô Periscope and other lawmakers‚Äô feeds. Other news networks and cable news channels, including MSNBC, FOX and CNN, also ran parts of the footage. C-SPAN communications director Howard Mortman said it was the first time the channel broadcast a live social media feed from the House floor. ‚ÄúThe House controls the cameras and that means they control the camera angles, the audio, video, the whole thing,‚Äù Mortman said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre using social media platforms to show what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith official broadcasts suspended in the House, we‚Äôve created a channel to follow #NoBillNoBreak on #Periscope live,‚Äù Periscope said in a tweet. Peters said about five or six Democratic House members had broadcast live video during the sit-in. Late Wednesday, lawmakers cheered their thanks during one of his feeds that aired on C-SPAN. One representative, Eric Swalwell of California, published live video from the House floor to Facebook. #NoBillNoBreak became a rallying cry for gun control supporters on Twitter and quickly became the top-trending hashtag in the United States on the social media platform. Politicians and average social media users alike used the hashtag as a sign of solidarity with the sit-in. ‚ÄúNowhere I‚Äôd rather spend my bday than the House floor w/ @repjohnlewis for gun control. #NoBillNoBreak #goodtrouble,‚Äù tweeted Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is mentioned as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

U.S. completes 'takedown' of Medicare fraud: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. law enforcement officials have charged 301 suspects with trying to defraud Medicare and other federal insurance programs in 2016, marking the ‚Äúlargest takedown‚Äù involving health care fraud allegations, the Justice Department said on Wednesday. The national sweep resulted in charges against doctors, nurses, pharmacists and physical therapists accused of fraud that cost the government $900 million, the department said.      The cases involved an array of charges, including conspiracy to commit health care fraud, money laundering and violations of an anti-kickback law.  This year‚Äôs sweep exceeded last year‚Äôs record in which 243 defendants faced charges in a combined $712 million in government losses. Officials said it was the largest takedown in the nine-year history of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, a joint initiative between federal, state and local law enforcement. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said some of the cases reflect new, troublesome trends, including instances of identity theft in order to prepare fake prescriptions and a growing number of cases involving compounding, or the mixing of medications tailored to meet a patient‚Äôs needs. Compounded medications are typically very expensive. From 2012 to 2014, the quarterly Medicare spending on these prescriptions skyrocketed from $28 million to $171 million. ‚ÄúAs this takedown should make clear, health care fraud is not an abstract violation or benign offense,‚Äù Lynch said. ‚ÄúIt is a serious crime.‚Äù  In one case, two owners of a group of outpatient clinics and a patient recruiter stand accused of filing $36 million in fraudulent claims for physical therapy and other services that were not medically necessary.  The Justice Department said that to find patients, the clinic operators and the recruiter targeted poor drug addicts and offered them narcotics so they could bill them for services that were never provided. Another case was filed against the operator of a marketing business that received referral fees from pharmacies that filled and billed Tricare, the U.S. military‚Äôs government insurance program, for compounded medicines.  The prescriptions were submitted via ‚Äútelemedicine‚Äù sites, and doctors were given blank prescription forms to fill out, regardless of medical necessity, according to the complaint. One doctor told the FBI her identity and medical credentials were used without her permission to fill thousands of dollars worth of prescriptions.",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 "
Medicare program spending within target rate: trustees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans‚Äô hospital bills will exhaust its reserves in 2028, two years sooner than last year‚Äôs estimate, trustees of the program said on Wednesday, but spending growth remained within forecasts. The Medicare program, which provides health coverage for more than 55 million older as well as disabled people, said that the projected growth rate for per capita spending has not exceeded its target. That put aside the need for the program‚Äôs regulator, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, to establish a savings target and to initiate mandatory spending cuts, their annual financial report said. As such, the government would not need to immediately set up an Independent Payment Advisory Board to make proposals on the cuts, it said. Drug stocks gained after the release of the report on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index up 2.5 percent. It had lost ground ahead of the report‚Äôs release. Wall Street analysts had worried that if the mandatory savings clause was triggered, the new board might have tried to implement cuts in prescription drug prices. ‚ÄúNot hitting the trigger is good news for healthcare investors,‚Äù Sanford Bernstein analyst Timothy Anderson wrote in a research note. In the annual financial review, the trustees also said that the combined Social Security and disability trust fund reserves are estimated to run out in 2034, the same projection as last year. Medicare spending in 2015 totaled $647.6 billion.    The Medicare program‚Äôs trust fund for hospital care is still scheduled to have sufficient funding 11 years longer than the estimate given before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the trustees said. The trustees put the shorter timeline down to changes in estimates of income and cost, particularly in the near term. A depletion in funds available for Medicare and Social Security does not mean the programs would suddenly stop. At the current rate of payroll tax collections, Medicare would be able to cover 87 percent of costs in 2028. This would fall to 79 percent by 2043 and then gradually increase. Social Security would be able to pay about three-quarters of scheduled benefits from 2034 to 2090, the trustees said.  ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 "

"Rubio seeks re-election to Senate, says Trump 'worrisome'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will seek re-election to his U.S. Senate seat, he announced on Wednesday, reversing a pledge not to run and saying the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency worries him. The first-term Florida senator said the Senate can be frustrating, but that it is also a place where policy advances can be made and one that can counteract the power of the White House. ‚ÄúBut as we begin the next chapter in the history of our nation, there‚Äôs another role for the Senate that could end up being its most important in the years to come: The Constitutional power to act as a check and balance on the excesses of a president,‚Äù Rubio said in a statement. The 45-year-old lawmaker, a proven fund-raiser who is well known nationally, had been under intense pressure to run, especially given the cost of contesting an important election swing-state where campaign advertising is expensive. Republicans are more likely to retain his seat if he is a candidate in the Nov. 8 general election, as they face a tough fight to preserve their majority in the Senate. He could also rally Republican voters to head to the polls in a state that is critical in the presidential race. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, took Florida by just a one percentage-point margin in 2012 over Republican Mitt Romney. This year, Republicans must defend 24 of the 54 seats they now hold in the 100-member Senate, compared with just 10 the Democrats have to fight to retain. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it would be a ‚Äúterrific outcome‚Äù if Rubio decided to run.  Rubio had harsh words for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, predicting her election would mean four more years of what he termed Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúfailed‚Äù policies. But he said the prospect of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the White House was also ‚Äúworrisome,‚Äù citing Trump‚Äôs statements about women and minorities and noting that many of the likely Republican nominee‚Äôs positions on important issues are unknown. ‚ÄúIf he is elected, we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him,‚Äù Rubio‚Äôs statement said. Still, he pledged to vote for Trump, a real estate mogul and political neophyte who has shaken the Republican establishment.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the choice I wanted ... and it‚Äôs not the choice a lot of people are comfortable with, but it‚Äôs the choice we have,‚Äù he told CNN in an interview. His announcement did not mention the massacre last week at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, but he had said in recent days he was reconsidering his decision not to run because of his concern about serious events in the country, including the mass shooting. The decision reversed a campaign pledge Rubio made a year ago to retire from the Senate if his presidential bid failed. He ended his bid for the nomination in March after losing the primary in his home state to Trump following a harsh war of words. The Cook Political Report said Rubio‚Äôs announcement ‚Äúbreathed new life‚Äù into Republican chances of holding onto the seat but still rated the race as a toss-up, citing his poor Senate attendance record and the senator‚Äôs remarks during his presidential campaign that he was ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù with the upper chamber. Republican U.S. Representative David Jolly, who had been seeking the Senate seat, opened the door for Rubio to run when he stepped aside last week.  After Wednesday‚Äôs announcement, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera, a friend of Rubio, and Republican U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis also scrapped plans to seek the seat. Other Republicans, however, have not announced plans to quit ahead of Florida‚Äôs Aug. 30 primary. U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, a leading Democratic challenger, accused Rubio of first abandoning his constituents, and now ‚Äútreating them like a consolation prize.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 "

"Former Ford, Bush national security adviser Scowcroft endorses Clinton","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Brent Scowcroft, who was national security adviser to two Republican U.S. presidents, on Wednesday endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump, in a snub of the Republican Party‚Äôs likely nominee by a prominent member of its security wing. ‚ÄúThe presidency requires the judgment and the knowledge to make tough calls under pressure,‚Äù the Republican elder statesman said in a statement. ‚ÄúI believe Hillary Clinton has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.‚Äù Scowcroft, 91, served as national security adviser under Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. Ford was president from 1974 to 1977 and Bush from 1989 to 1993. He joined a number of well-known Republicans defecting due to the prospect of a Trump presidency, including Richard Armitage, deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush.  Armitage gave Clinton, 68, who was secretary of state under Democratic President Barack Obama, his backing last week. Trump ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt appear to be a Republican, he doesn‚Äôt appear to want to learn about issues. So, I‚Äôm going to vote for Mrs. Clinton,‚Äù Armitage told Politico at the time.  The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Scowcroft‚Äôs endorsement of Clinton. Trump, 70, who has never held elected office, often boasts on the campaign trail his relative newness to politics, appealing to voters disillusioned by the current political climate.  Despite that facet of his appeal - which helped Trump beat 16 rivals in the campaign‚Äôs primary phase to become his party‚Äôs presumptive nominee - establishment Republicans worry that his inexperience and brash style will alienate foreign allies and other international partners. Among his proposals, Trump has criticized NATO, a cornerstone of U.S. security policy, and said he would consider letting Japan and South Korea develop their own nuclear weapons instead of relying on the United States for protection against North Korea and China. ‚ÄúSecretary Clinton shares my belief that America must remain the world‚Äôs indispensable leader,‚Äù Scowcroft said. ‚ÄúShe understands that our leadership and engagement beyond our borders makes the world, and therefore the United States, more secure and prosperous.‚Äù Trump has said he would strengthen national security, but has offered few details about his plans, other than his proposals to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexican border and for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.  Many national security experts have expressed alarm over the proposed ban and have warned that Trump‚Äôs fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail is fueling extremism. ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 "
"Clinton offers her vision for U.S economy, rebukes Trump's","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday that if the U.S. Congress does not act to close tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy and corporations, she will ask the Treasury Department to take up the issue if she is elected president. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make sure that Wall Street, corporations and the super rich pay their fair share of taxes,‚Äù Clinton said in Raleigh, North Carolina, the state capital. The former U.S. secretary of state used her campaign stop to offer her vision for bolstering the economy after using a speech on the topic on Tuesday to attack presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, predicting a ‚ÄúTrump recession‚Äù if he becomes president. Trump delivered his own speech attacking Clinton on Wednesday, saying she is part of a political establishment that has cheated American workers through bad trade deals. In her speech on Wednesday, Clinton said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs an understatement to say Americans face a choice in November. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here today to offer an alternative. ‚ÄúWhen people say the game is rigged, the best evidence is the (U.S.) tax code. It is riddled with scams, loopholes and other special breaks,‚Äù added Clinton, the presumptive Democratic  nominee. She said that if the Republican-controlled Congress does not enact reforms to end tax breaks for the wealthy, she would use her presidential authority to direct the Treasury Department to do so. Democratic President Barack Obama has faced criticism for using executive action. In one example, he used executive power to shield certain groups from the threat of deportation when immigration legislation stalled in Congress. Clinton said modifying the tax code is one prong in a five-part plan the federal government would follow to jump-start the American economy if she is elected on Nov. 8: - Large-scale investment in rebuilding infrastructure to create well-paying jobs;  - Enabling debt-free college educations; - Giving companies incentives to share profits with employees; - Creating national family-friendly policies such as paid family leave. In a nod to populists within the Democratic Party who may have supported U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic Primary, Clinton also said she would aim to raise the federal minimum wage, strengthen labor unions and reject international trade deals that do not benefit U.S. workers. ‚ÄúAs I said during the primary, I am a progressive who likes to get things done, and we can do this,‚Äù Clinton said.

"Seeking to regain ground, Trump calls Clinton corrupt and a liar","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump staged a harsh attack on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, accusing her of corruption and dangerous incompetence as he tried to put his campaign back on track after recent setbacks. In a speech in New York that Clinton‚Äôs campaign called ‚Äúnutty‚Äù and that was criticized by some Republicans, Trump argued that the former secretary of state is part of a political establishment that has cheated American workers through bad trade deals and endangered U.S. national security. Both candidates are seeking to overcome their high unfavorable ratings among voters at the Nov. 8 election by painting the other as a villain who puts personal gain over the interests of less powerful Americans.  Even by the standards of modern presidential races, the sparring between Clinton, a former secretary of state and U.S. senator, and brash businessman Trump has made for unusually acidic rhetoric. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States,‚Äù Trump told a small crowd of supporters at a hotel he owns in Manhattan, accusing her of having run the State Department ‚Äúlike her own personal hedge fund.‚Äù  Clinton‚Äôs staff quickly dismissed that attack and others as ‚Äúlies.‚Äù Trump read his speech from a teleprompter to curb his off-the-cuff comments but he pulled no punches. He said Clinton ‚Äúhas perfected the politics of personal profit and theft‚Äù and described her as ‚Äúa world-class liar.‚Äù Republican Lindsey Graham, a U.S. senator from South Carolina who has so far declined to support Trump, said he disagreed that Clinton may be the most corrupt person to have run for the White House, and challenged Trump to become more presidential. ‚ÄúMy advice to Mr. Trump would be to make the case that you have the temperament, knowledge and judgment to be president,‚Äù he said on CNN. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the mountain you‚Äôve got to climb.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs campaign has been distracted in recent weeks by racially-charged comments he made about a Mexican-American judge and the Republican‚Äôs firing of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski this week.     The New York real estate mogul is trailing Clinton in most opinion polls, and campaign finance figures released on Monday show he has raised only a fraction of the amount Clinton has brought in, although Trump has said he is willing to loan his campaign more money.     In his speech, Trump repeated accusations that Clinton‚Äôs decisions as America‚Äôs top diplomat were influenced by donations to the Clinton Foundation and associated charities.  Clinton and her staff have denied this and similar allegations, dismissing them as politically motivated smears. ‚ÄúThe only thing Donald Trump offered today was more hypocritical lies and nutty conspiracy theories,‚Äù Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said. The State Department has said it is not aware of any evidence of improper influence, although it has acknowledged that new donations from foreign governments should have been submitted to the department‚Äôs ethics advisers for prior review but were not, in breach of an ethics agreement Clinton signed before taking office. Trump attacked the Clinton Foundation for accepting millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and other countries criticized by the United States for not protecting the rights of women and gay people. Clinton‚Äôs husband, former President Bill Clinton, has said that accepting such funding is not an endorsement of everything a foreign government does. Clinton added a pointed defense of the Clinton Foundation in a speech later on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe Clinton Foundation helps poor people around the world get access to lifesaving AIDS medicine,‚Äù she told cheering supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. ‚ÄúDonald Trump uses poor people around the world to produce his line of suits and ties.‚Äù Trump also said Clinton had used bad political judgment in her four years as secretary of state, failing to stop the rise of Islamic State, keep strong sanctions on Iran or avoid chaos in Libya. ‚ÄúHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched,‚Äù Trump said.          On Tuesday, Clinton delivered her own blistering attack on Trump, saying that putting him in the White House would be a disaster for the U.S. economy.  On Wednesday, Clinton won the endorsement of former U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, a Republican who served under Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed that 44.5 percent of likely voters backed Clinton, while 35.5 percent supported Trump. Some of the accusations made by Trump on Wednesday appeared to contradict the public record. He said Clinton would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees to the United States without any prior screening. But under the current process, refugees must wait months or years in foreign camps while U.S. security agencies review their backgrounds, a system Clinton supports. Trump said Clinton was sleeping ‚Äúsoundly‚Äù in her bed as a deadly attack unfolded in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 in which four Americans were killed. State Department records show Clinton was in her State Department office when news of the opening assaults came through. She has said she later worked through the night on the U.S. response.             ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 "

Trump to detour from campaign to visit Scotland golf properties,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facing slumping poll numbers and a shakeup of his team, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump takes a detour from the campaign trail this week to visit his golf resorts in Scotland. Trump leaves Thursday on a three-day trip centered on the grand reopening of Trump Turnberry, which the New York businessman bought in 2014 and renovated at an estimated cost of $290 million. He will also visit his other Scottish golf property in Aberdeen. His visit to Scotland, the birthplace of his mother, comes as Britain votes on Thursday on whether to remain in the European Union. Trump has said Britain would probably be better off if it left the EU. He will hold a news conference on Friday when he will doubtless be asked to respond to the vote. Trump‚Äôs trip abroad comes at an unusual time given the political calendar. With less than a month left until the Republican convention in Cleveland where he is to be formally nominated, Trump is lagging in fundraising and campaign organization and taking heavy fire from Democrat Hillary Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election. He is under pressure to adopt a more presidential demeanor and strengthen his campaign organization after a rocky period in which he criticized a U.S.-born federal judge as unfair because of his Mexican heritage and took fire for his response to the killing of 49 people at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub. Just this week, he fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski at the urging of family members alarmed at the direction of his campaign. It also emerged that he had only $1.3 million in cash on hand at the end of May to fund his campaign, compared with  Clinton‚Äôs war chest of $42 million. His poll numbers have also dropped. After sealing the nomination seven weeks ago, Trump was basically tied in national polls with Clinton. But she has crept ahead in many polls in the past two weeks. Trump and his aides see the Scotland visit as a chance to showcase his far-flung business empire and job-creating abilities. Aides said the trip also reinforced¬†his ancestral ties to Scotland and his love of family, with his children playing an important role in his business dealings. But many Republicans see Trump‚Äôs trip to Scotland as a waste of valuable time. ‚ÄúIt has nothing to do with running for president,‚Äù said Republican strategist Rick Tyler, who was a spokesman for  former presidential candidate, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. ‚ÄúIt speaks to the non-seriousness of the campaign when you‚Äôre taking time off the campaign trail to leave the country for a place where there are no voters.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs golf properties are among his proudest business possessions and he is particularly proud of Turnberry, where the British Open has been played four times, including the famed ‚ÄúDuel in the Sun‚Äù in 1977 when Tom Watson edged Jack Nicklaus by one stroke. Limiting the trip to his golf properties means there are likely to be fewer chances for missteps like 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney‚Äôs gaffe-filled trip to London, Jerusalem and Poland four years ago. But it offers little chance for Trump to burnish his foreign policy credentials. ‚ÄúTraditionally, nominees take overseas trips to build their foreign policy chops,‚Äù said Republican strategist Scott Reed. Trump is not meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has denounced Trump as divisive for his proposed Muslim ban and anti-immigrant rhetoric. ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 "
House Republicans unveil healthcare alternative to Obamacare,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled an alternative plan to overhaul the nation‚Äôs healthcare system on Wednesday, slamming Obamacare even as they aimed to keep some of its more popular provisions. Their proposal, part of broader effort by House Speaker Paul Ryan to offer a Republican agenda ahead of the Nov. 8 elections, is conservatives‚Äô latest bid to ‚Äúrepeal and replace‚Äù the 2010 law. Ryan, the country‚Äôs highest-ranking elected Republican, is offering the proposal as the party seeks to maintain control of both the House and the Senate and take over the White House. Other proposals cover tax reform, address poverty as well as national security. Republicans have challenged President Barack Obama‚Äôs signature Affordable Care Act since it was enacted and have voted repeatedly to repeal it. Obama, a Democrat, has said it has helped some 20 million Americans get health care coverage. Ryan acknowledged his agenda was unlikely to displace current law anytime soon.     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to repeal Obamacare when the current president of the United States is a guy named Obama,‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúWhat we are laying out today is a first-time-in-six-years consensus by the Republicans in the House on what we replace Obamacare with.‚Äù In their plan, which is not formal legislation, House Republicans blasted Obamacare for limiting patients‚Äô choices, increasing consumer costs, and burying employers and health care providers under new regulations. Ryan‚Äôs proposal would keep some popular pieces, including not allowing people with pre-existing conditions to be denied coverage and permitting children to stay on their parents‚Äô coverage until age 26. It would also allow states that have already expanded the number of people eligible for Medicaid under the law to maintain the additional coverage, although it would prevent any new states from doing so.      For people without insurance through their jobs, the Republicans would establish a refundable tax credit. Obamacare also provides subsidies for people to buy insurance if they do not qualify for Medicaid. It also includes long-held Republican proposals such as allowing consumers to buy health insurance across state lines, expanding health savings accounts, reforming medical liability rules and giving block grants to states to run Medicaid programs for the poor. Democrats, who have said they are open to tweaking Obamacare, dismissed Ryan‚Äôs proposals as little more than warmed-over ideas that have long been in the Republican playbook.  House Republican would gradually raise the Medicare eligibility age, now 65, to match that of the Social Security pension plan, which is 67 for people born in 1960 or later. Like Obamacare‚Äôs so-called Cadillac tax on expensive healthcare plans offered by employers, which goes into effect in 2018, the Republican proposal would cap the tax deductibility of employer-based plans.  Industry groups struck a bipartisan tone in their reaction ahead of the election, as it remains to be seen who ultimately wins control of Congress and the White House.  ‚ÄúWe stand ready to work with both parties on market-based solutions that improve access and affordability for consumers,‚Äù said Marilyn Tavenner, president of America‚Äôs Health Insurance Plans.

Democratic senators ask Justice Department to block insurance megamergers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven Democratic senators urged the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday to block two mergers of major health insurance companies, saying that the proposed deals would mean higher premiums and lower-quality healthcare for consumers. The department is reviewing Aetna Inc‚Äôs $33 billion plan to buy Humana Inc and Anthem Inc‚Äôs $48 billion proposal to buy Cigna Corp. If approved, the deals, both of which were announced last July, would reduce the number of national health insurance carriers from five to three. ‚ÄúWe urge the DOJ (Justice Department) to challenge these mergers from proceeding and to prevent the damage they would cause to competition and consumers,‚Äù wrote Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Al Franken of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dianne Feinstein of California and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. The letter was dated Wednesday and addressed to Renata Hesse, who heads the Justice Department‚Äôs Antitrust Division. In the letter, the lawmakers said they were skeptical of the idea that the proposed deals would be good for consumers because the companies could use their larger size to hammer out better deals for patients.  ‚ÄúThe evidence overwhelmingly suggests that few if any cost savings secured by the merging firms through the exercise of market power will be passed on to consumers,‚Äù they wrote. The lawmakers also disagreed with the notion that the sale of carefully chosen assets to a competitor could resolve antitrust issues, and pointed to past instances where mergers with divestitures led to higher premiums or where competitors bought divested assets, but then did not use them. ‚ÄúWe are not convinced that any divestitures required of the merging parties will succeed today, given that they have so clearly failed in the recent past,‚Äù the lawmakers wrote. Capitol Hill does not have a say in whether the Justice Department sues to stop deals. Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said that the company planned to close the merger with Humana in the second half of this year. ‚ÄúWe believe a combined company is in the best interest of consumers. We continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice on its thorough review of the transaction,‚Äù Crawford said. Representatives of Anthem could not immediately be reached for comment.

Peru president-elect jokes about ending ties with U.S. if Trump wins,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru‚Äôs president-elect Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said amid laughter on Tuesday that his government would sever ties with the United States if Republican Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election in November. Kuczynski, a 77-year-old former investment banker who won the Andean country‚Äôs tight runoff race earlier this month, said he mentioned his worries about a Trump presidency to U.S. President Barack Obama on a congratulatory phone call. Asked by a reporter what would happen to relations with the United States if Trump wins, a laughing Kuczynski said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to grab a saw and cut them off!‚Äù The presumptive Republican nominee in the race to succeed Obama, Trump has sparked criticism across Latin America for his anti-immigrant rhetoric, especially in Mexico where President Enrique Pena Nieto has compared his campaign to the rise of Adolf Hitler. Trump is a threat to the region ‚Äúbecause he wants to put up a wall between the United States and Latin America and make Mexicans pay for it!‚Äù Kuczynski said in reference to Trump‚Äôs proposal for stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs across the southern U.S. border. Peru is a leading global supplier of copper and gold. It also shares the dubious distinction with neighboring Colombia of being one of the world‚Äôs leading producers of cocaine.

Clinton's lead over Trump narrows to nine points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lead over Republican rival Donald Trump has slipped by about five percentage points since mid-June, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, bringing the race for the White House to within nine points.  The poll showed that 44.5 percent of likely voters supported former secretary of state Clinton while 35.5 percent backed businessman Trump. That compares with 46.6 percent support for Clinton and 32.3 percent for Trump on June 12, a date that marked her widest lead for the month. Trump has focused much of his energy in recent days on the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida by a U.S.-born gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State militant group. Trump vowed to ban people from entering the United States from countries with links to terrorism against America or its allies. Hardline national security proposals have help Trump win increased support from voters in the past, including after the shootings in San Bernardino, California and Paris late last year. Clinton responded to the Orlando attack by calling for increased intelligence gathering and air strikes on Islamic State forces, while warning against demonizing American Muslims. She has also criticized Trump‚Äôs positions on foreign policy and the economy, saying a Trump presidency would be a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù.

Former California state senator pleads guilty to corruption charge,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former California Senator Ron Calderon pleaded guilty in a federal court on Tuesday to a single count of mail fraud, ending a public corruption case in which he admitted to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes, prosecutors said. Calderon, a Democrat from the Los Angeles suburb of Montebello, left office in 2014 after serving a dozen years in the state Senate and four years in the Assembly. Sentencing is set for Sept. 19. The 58-year-old former politician reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors last week, several weeks before he was scheduled to go on trial on charges contained in a 24-count indictment. His mail fraud offense carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, but prosecutors agreed under the terms of Calderon‚Äôs plea deal to seek a sentence of no more than 70 months, the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office said in a statement. Once an influential figure in the California Legislature, Calderon was one of three Democrats in the state Senate  suspended over ethics charges in 2014, costing their party a cherished two-thirds Senate majority during an election year. According to his indictment, Calderon accepted $100,000 in bribes from the owner of a Long Beach hospital to preserve a loophole in the law that allowed companies controlled by the owner to charge more for hardware used in spinal surgeries. Calderon also was accused of taking bribes from undercover FBI agents posing as Hollywood movie executives in exchange for steering legislation in their favor.  His older brother, Tom Calderon, 62, a former member of the California state Assembly who became a political consultant, also was named in the indictment. He pleaded guilty last Monday to a federal money-laundering charge for allowing bribes earmarked for his brother to be funneled through his firm, according to the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office. Prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence of no more than a year in prison for the elder Calderon brother.     ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 "
'Glimmer of hope' seen for compromise U.S. gun control bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators pushed for a compromise gun control bill on Tuesday, a day after the Senate failed to advance four gun measures following last week‚Äôs mass shooting in Orlando, the deadliest in modern U.S. history.   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would schedule a vote on a bill by fellow Republican Senator Susan Collins that would prevent about 109,000 people on ‚Äúno-fly‚Äù and other surveillance lists from purchasing guns. Collins said she expected a vote on the bill this week or next. On Monday, the Senate defeated a Democratic prohibition on gun sales to people on a broader range of government watch lists, while also blocking a narrower Republican measure.  Some senior Republicans would not commit to supporting the Collins bill, citing worries about people being denied the ability to buy weapons without adequate safeguards. But the No. 3 Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, told reporters: ‚ÄúThere may be a glimmer of hope now,‚Äù adding that Collins‚Äô proposal seemed to be ‚Äúa step in the right direction.‚Äù The measure is being debated in the Senate before the Nov. 8 election when Democrats hope to win control of the Senate and gain seats in the House of Representatives. Democrats believe Republican congressional opposition to wider control bills gives them a powerful campaign issue. It was too soon to tell if President Barack Obama would support the Collins bill. Spokesman Josh Earnest said senior officials including lawyers at the Department of Justice were taking a look at it. ‚ÄúIf the assessment is that this would enhance the ability of our law enforcement professionals to keep us safe and prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing a gun, then that‚Äôs likely something that we‚Äôll be able to support,‚Äù Earnest told reporters in a daily briefing.   In the Senate on Monday, four measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales to those on terrorism watch lists - two put forth by Democrats and two by Republicans - fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100-member chamber. The votes were a bitter setback to advocates who have failed to get even modest gun curbs through Congress despite repeated mass shootings. The bills lost in largely party-line votes that showed the political power in Congress of gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association. The White House accused U.S. senators of a ‚Äúshameful display of cowardice‚Äù and said they failed the American people by not advancing any gun control measures after the Florida shooting. The gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to Islamic State during the June 12 rampage in which he killed 49 people and wounded 53 at an Orlando gay nightclub before being fatally shot by police. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he had concerns about the Collins measure. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a slippery slope when an American citizen is denied a constitutional right, without forcing the government to come forward with some evidence on the front end‚Äù that a person should be prohibited from buying guns, he said.   After Monday‚Äôs votes, the Senate also debated a different tactic for battling domestic attacks that could be inspired by Islamic State and other foreign militant groups. Senators were aiming to vote by Wednesday on legislation by Republican John McCain of Arizona expanding the Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs ability to conduct secret surveillance in counter terrorism investigations. ‚ÄúThis week we‚Äôll have the opportunity to strengthen our ability to combat lone wolf terrorists and connect the dots so we are better able to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States‚Äù such as the Orlando massacre, McConnell said. Collins, who held a news conference with eight other senators including Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida, said her bill would stop about 2,700 Americans and 106,300 foreign national on surveillance lists from buying guns. ‚ÄúWe believe that if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane you are too dangerous to buy a gun,‚Äù the Maine lawmaker said. She said Americans and immigrants with work permits could appeal a denial and recover lawyers‚Äô fees if they prevailed.  Nelson said he owed it to the families of the victims in the Orlando shooting as well as police and other first responders to the carnage.  It was not clear whether Collins‚Äô plan would draw significant bipartisan support. The NRA said her proposal was ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù and would not have prevented the Orlando attack.  Gun control groups promised to intensify their push for legislative action, and not just in Washington. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said her group, besides supporting pro-gun control candidates for Congress, would work to strengthen gun-sale background check laws ‚Äústate by state until Congress acts.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf the NRA and their lapdogs in the Senate thought moms would feel dispirited and back down, they are sorely mistaken,‚Äù Watts told reporters in a teleconference.

Senate prepares Puerto Rico debt debate amid Democrats' concerns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday that amendments were necessary to a Puerto Rico debt bill that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said would be voted on by next week. Reid, speaking to reporters, said changes were needed to the federal board overseeing the restructuring of Puerto Rico‚Äôs $70 billion debt under the bill, but he did not say whether Democrats would be successful in making any changes. The House of Representatives passed a Puerto Rico debt relief bill on June 9, following months of internal debate. Supporters hope the Senate passes that bill, without any amendment, before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment. The Caribbean island, which is a U.S. territory, is suffering a poverty rate of about 45 percent and has been hobbled by worsening debt problems. Some schools and medical facilities are closing and thousands of residents are relocating to the U.S. mainland, further shrinking Puerto Rico‚Äôs tax base. While Reid said he had ‚Äúsome serious concerns‚Äù with the current bill, which was negotiated by the Obama administration and lawmakers in the House, he did not say whether he expected any amendments to succeed in the Senate. A Senate debate over amendments could simply help put Democrats on record registering their concerns with the legislation. ‚ÄúAt the very minimum, we need some amendments to make sure that people understand what is not in that bill,‚Äù Reid said. Democrats in both chambers have voiced concerns over some potential minimum-wage reductions for young workers that Republicans included in the House bill. They also have said the federal oversight board, to be appointed by Washington, might not have Puerto Rico‚Äôs best interests in mind. Supporters of the bill have argued it is the best measure that can pass the Republican-controlled Congress and that  Puerto Rico could slip into chaos without action. ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 "
"Trump shrugs off campaign funding lag, cites personal wealth","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump said on Tuesday his ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù trove of personal wealth would help compensate for his poor presidential campaign fundraising, even as he took steps to court new donors to help win the White House. The New York real estate mogul raised only $3.1 million in individual contributions in May and ended the month with $1.3 million in cash, leaving him far behind his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton who brought in $26 million and closed the month‚Äôs books with a $42 million war chest. The figures underscore the huge cash advantage Clinton is hoping to enjoy leading into the Nov. 8 presidential election, one that could allow her a large staff and millions of dollars of television and digital ads in battleground states. Trump, who openly shunned donations while winning the party nomination, rebuffed criticism from Republicans who say he needs to raise cash for the general election fight against Clinton. His campaign might need in excess of $1 billion by some estimates but Trump said money was not a problem.      ‚ÄúIf need be, there could be unlimited ‚Äòcash on hand‚Äô as I would put up my own money,‚Äù Trump said in a statement, which asserted he had already spent over $50 million dollars on his bid for the White House.  The billionaire candidate added that his campaign also costs less than a traditional one because it is ‚Äúis leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.‚Äù Trump has said he is worth more than $10 billion, but much of his money is tied up in properties and businesses. Estimates from outside groups have put Trump‚Äôs wealth as low as $1 billion. Forbes magazine estimates it at $4.5 billion. According to Trump‚Äôs most recent personal financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, in May, he had between $65 mln and $175 million in liquid assets ‚Äì money in funds, equities and cash. Despite Trump‚Äôs professed lack of concern for standard campaign fundraising, he took steps to boost donations. Several sources with knowledge of Trump‚Äôs fundraising activities said he will attend a dinner on Tuesday evening to court hedge fund managers and other Wall Street donors.  Woody Johnson, the billionaire investor and owner of the New York Jets football team, is also hosting a breakfast for Trump at a high-end restaurant in Manhattan on Wednesday morning. Targeting smaller donors, Trump on Tuesday also sent his first email asking for donations, telling supporters that he will match their contributions up to $2 million. Trump‚Äôs allies, donors, and other Republican operatives have expressed concerns about his campaign operation, which has been dogged by internal battles, a threadbare campaign infrastructure, and thin fundraising apparatus. ‚ÄúWithout money you don‚Äôt have a campaign,‚Äù said Stan Hubbard, a Republican donor from Minnesota who owns a chain of radio stations and who has contributed to Trump.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got to call on people to give money and stop all this nonsense about funding his own campaign,‚Äù Hubbard said.  Trump this week fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who had been overseeing the campaign‚Äôs fundraising arm. Trump has spent much of the race so far breaking the mold of a traditional campaign, defeating a crowded field of primary opponents who vastly outspent him in ads and staff.     During the Republican primary race, he often told his supporters not to contribute money and ridiculed opponents for accepting cash from special interest groups and wealthy contributors.     He has so far showed little interest in calling donors to ask for money for his general election battle. He only began holding in-person fundraisers in late May. ‚ÄúTrump defeated the most talented GOP field in a generation with less staff, less experience and less money in much less time,‚Äù said Republican strategist Keith Appell.  ‚ÄúThat said, Trump‚Äôs campaign needs to transition quickly to a national, general election effort online, on the air and on the ground ‚Äì his populist, anti-Washington, new leadership message has been muddled by sideshow issues.‚Äù Trump has loaned his campaign $46 million since launching last year, federal filings show. He often uses his own plane to travel to campaign events, and also uses his hotels and other properties as venues - expenses he is required by law to reimburse from his campaign funds. The campaign has spent about $6.2 million with Trump businesses including TAG Air and his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. It has also reimbursed Trump about $390,000 for some payroll and other expenses.  The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, announced it raised $11 million in May, and had $19.9 million in cash at the beginning of June. The RNC will help Trump‚Äôs effort to get elected, but also helps fund congressional races.   ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 "

Kerry meets authors of dissenting cable on U.S. Syria policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met on Tuesday with about 10 of the 51 State Department officials who last week wrote a cable disagreeing with U.S. policy toward Syria and arguing for ‚Äúa more militarily assertive U.S. role.‚Äù Multiple U.S. officials have said they do not expect the memo, conveyed through the State Department‚Äôs relatively rarely used ‚Äúdissent channel,‚Äù a conduit for voicing contrary views, to change U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs policy. In the cable, the diplomats call for military strikes against President Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs government to stop its persistent violations of a civil war ceasefire Obama‚Äôs policy toward Syria, where a civil war has burned for more than five years, has been predicated on the goal of avoiding deeper military entanglements in the Middle East, and has been widely criticized as hesitant and risk-averse. Obama‚Äôs limited intervention has focused on fighting the Islamic State militant group that controls a swathe of Syria and Iraq and that has inspired attacks on U.S. soil. The memo by the State Department officials demanded a more muscular stance. While State Department spokesman John Kirby said that Kerry had met with about 10 of the officials for half an hour on Tuesday, he declined to provide details of their discussion about the cable, which the department has not made public. ‚ÄúWe believe that achieving our objectives will continue to elude us if we do not include the use of military force as an option to enforce the Cessation of Hostilities (CoH) and compel the Syrian regime to abide by its terms as well as to negotiate a political solution in good faith,‚Äù said a draft of the memo posted online by The New York Times.

Federal judges question intent behind North Carolina voting law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal appeals court judges on Tuesday probed the intent behind a sweeping 2013 North Carolina law that changed the state‚Äôs election rules. A lawyer for the state, Thomas Farr, defended the law and denied claims by attorneys for the U.S. Justice Department and civil rights groups that the law intentionally suppressed minority voters, speaking before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. The court already temporarily stayed the law‚Äôs provisions that eliminate voters‚Äô ability to register the same day they vote and to vote outside their assigned precincts, methods that critics say are disproportionately used by minority voters. If the appeals court follows a lower court‚Äôs April ruling and upholds the law, those options may not be available for North Carolina voters in the upcoming election in November, widely viewed as one of the most critical presidential and general elections in recent U.S. history. Judge Henry Floyd asked Farr about the fact that the legislature considered an expanded version of the law soon after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Shelby County v. Holder that Congress could no longer subject states with a record of race-based voter discrimination to special elections oversight. North Carolina‚Äôs Republican-controlled legislature got the ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to change some ‚Äúpretty liberal voter registration provisions‚Äù with that decision, Floyd said.  ‚ÄúAnd it happened the same day Shelby was decided. Looks pretty bad to me, in terms of purposeful discrimination,‚Äù he added. Judge James Wynn asked Farr what type of voter behavior information the state legislature considered when passing the law: ‚ÄúAt the time that it enacted this, did it have ... information that the use of these particular procedures was disproportionately higher in the minority community than they were in the non-minority community?‚Äù  Farr replied that the state board of elections launched a campaign to educate voters about the new requirements. ‚ÄúWhen these rules were used in 2014 election, African-American turnout increased at a higher rate than whites,‚Äù Farr told Reuters by email after the hearing. Attorneys for the civil rights groups opposing the law appeared jubilant afterwards, greeting supporters outside the courthouse and at a local church in Richmond, where NAACP members sang, spoke and answered questions from reporters. ‚ÄúThe judges asked really probing questions to understand the crux of the matter,‚Äù said Allison Riggs, a lawyer for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. ‚ÄúThe court below just got the law wrong.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 "
Clinton says Trump presidency would be 'disastrous' for U.S. economy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that if Republican rival Donald Trump wins the White House, it will be a disaster for the U.S. economy, predicting a ‚ÄúTrump recession.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow I don‚Äôt say this because of typical political disagreements - liberals and conservatives say Trump‚Äôs ideas would be disastrous,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúEconomists on the right, the left and the center all agree Trump would throw us back into recession.‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs speech in Columbus, Ohio, a state that will be a battleground in the Nov. 8 election, was the second in which she has argued the wealthy businessman is ‚Äútemperamentally unfit‚Äù to lead the country. The first was on foreign relations and national security. ‚ÄúDonald Trump has said he is qualified to be president because of his business record,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs take a look at what he did for his businesses: He‚Äôs written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at Chapter 11; go figure,‚Äù Clinton said, in a jab referring to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Clinton then said Trump, a self-described ‚Äúking of debt,‚Äù had allowed businesses to amass huge debts and declare bankruptcy, leaving hundreds of people without jobs and wiping out shareholders. Allowing the United States to accrue similar debt would rattle investors and could lead to economic catastrophe, she added. On Twitter during Clinton‚Äôs speech, Trump said, ‚ÄúI am ‚Äòthe king of debt.‚Äô That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.‚Äù Clinton also said the likely Republican nominee‚Äôs tax plan - which aims to simplify the tax code, along with slashing the top corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent - would benefit the wealthy over working families. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated the plan would increase the federal deficit by $9.5 trillion over the next decade. The former secretary of state also said Trump‚Äôs plan to scrap trade deals could start ‚Äútrade wars‚Äù and that the agreements should instead be renegotiated if they do not benefit American workers.  Clinton said Trump‚Äôs plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and deport undocumented immigrants would shake the workforce and prove disastrous for the U.S. economy, creating a ‚ÄúTrump recession.‚Äù The tussle over the economy came as the two continued preparing for what is expected to be a fierce campaign. Trump was slated to give a speech criticizing Clinton in New York on Wednesday. As the presumptive Democratic nominee spoke on Tuesday, Trump‚Äôs campaign tested what appeared to be a more active rapid-response operation, sending emails saying Clinton‚Äôs husband, former President Bill Clinton, had backed bad trade deals and that her immigration plan would lower wages.

U.S. legal group lavishes praise on Obama Supreme Court nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The American Bar Association issued a glowing evaluation of President Barack Obama‚Äôs U.S. Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday, giving Merrick Garland its highest rating even as Senate Republicans stood firm in their blockade of his appointment. The influential lawyers association, which has evaluated the qualifications of nominees to the federal judiciary since 1953, deemed Garland ‚Äúwell qualified,‚Äù the highest of its three ratings, for a lifetime job on America‚Äôs highest court. ‚ÄúThe unanimous consensus of everyone we interviewed was  that Judge Garland is superbly competent to serve on the United  States Supreme Court,‚Äù the ABA panel that conducted the evaluation said in a report. Obama nominated Garland, 63, on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Garland is a centrist jurist with two decades as a federal appeals court judge. A nominee‚Äôs ABA rating typically is considered when the Senate acts on a judicial appointment. Republicans were unswayed. In an emailed statement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs office pointed out that Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, when they were senators, tried to block the 2006 Supreme Court confirmation of conservative Samuel Alito, even though he also earned the ABA‚Äôs highest rating.  Supreme Court nominations require Senate confirmation, and the Republicans who control the chamber have denied Garland customary hearings and a confirmation vote. Senate Republican leaders have vowed not to act on any Supreme Court nominee put forward by Obama, arguing that the next president, to be elected on Nov. 8 and take office on Jan. 20, should fill Scalia‚Äôs vacancy. Obama has accused Senate Republicans of abdicating their constitutional duties. The court is now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals, meaning Scalia‚Äôs successor could influence its ideological direction for years to come. The White House renewed its demand that the Senate act on Garland. Spokesman Josh Earnest said ‚Äúit is such a shame he has been treated so unfairly by the United States Senate‚Äù in an ‚Äúunprecedented partisan action.‚Äù The Republicans are hoping their presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, wins the presidency and nominates a conservative to the court. ‚ÄúThis significant point warrants repeating,‚Äù the ABA panel wrote. ‚ÄúAll of the experienced, dedicated and knowledgeable sitting judges, several former solicitor generals from both political parties, legal scholars from top law schools across the country,  and lawyers who have worked with or against the nominee in private practice, government or within the judiciary describe  the nominee as outstanding in all respects and cite specific evidence in support of that view.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 "

U.S. military says will not disclose details on injured service members,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military will not provide details on specific cases of American service members injured in Iraq and Syria because it could give information to Islamic State militants, a Pentagon spokesman said on Tuesday The spokesman, Peter Cook, was responding to a question at a Pentagon press briefing seeking confirmation that four Americans had been wounded in Syria earlier this month.  Cook said there had been no a change in policy and aggregate numbers would still be provided. ‚ÄúOur policy is not to identify wounded service members for a variety of reasons, including operational security, including privacy reasons,‚Äù Cook said.  ‚ÄúAlso, we do not want to provide additional information to the enemy that might enhance their own assessment on the battlefield situation,‚Äù he said. However, the Pentagon has released such information in the past and responded to queries, and it was unclear how Cook‚Äôs comments were consistent with previous disclosures. Last month a spokesman said two U.S. service member had been injured, one each in Iraq and Syria, during the last weekend in May. Captain Jeff Davis said the incident in Iraq took place in the north, near Erbil, while the injury in Syria was north of Raqqa, Islamic State‚Äôs de facto capital. According to Pentagon data, there have been 16 American service members wounded in action since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve, the military‚Äôs name for an operation targeting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria which started in 2014.  Cook‚Äôs comments came the same day that President Barack Obama visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center; he has visited wounded U.S. service members there throughout his presidency.

New Jersey governor proposes flat rate for education funding,"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Tuesday proposed overhauling the state‚Äôs education funding formula to provide all public school districts with a flat rate of $6,599 per student. Calling it his ‚ÄúFairness Formula‚Äù in policy statements on Tuesday, Christie said aid for special needs students would continue even with any potential formula change. Schools are funded through property taxes, which in New Jersey are some of the highest in the nation because of the state‚Äôs ‚Äúunaffordable and broken school funding formula propped up by special interests and misguided Supreme Court precedent,‚Äù Christie said in a statement. He said he would traverse the state this summer to talk about the proposal. The amount of state aid school districts receive now varies widely, with some getting less than $3,000 per pupil and others getting as much as $28,000 Such a change would be an uphill battle, as it would need approval from a Democrat-led legislature that has already rejected previous education formula changes from Christie, a Republican. ‚ÄúGovernor Christie‚Äôs idea is unconstitutional and harmful to our most vulnerable children,‚Äù Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that Christie still hasn‚Äôt fully funded schools under the existing formula. Currently, poorer districts receive more state aid under a formula based on a 1990 New Jersey Supreme Court decision called     Abbott v. Burke II, which ruled the state‚Äôs education funding was unfair and that low-income ‚ÄúAbbott districts‚Äù must be funded on par with wealthier ones.   ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 "
"Briton arrested at Trump rally 'wouldn't hurt a fly,' father says","DORKING, England (Reuters) - A man charged with trying to attack Donald Trump with a policeman‚Äôs gun found it hard to cope with life but did not have political views and was never violent, his father told British media on Tuesday.    Michael Sandford was arrested after trying to grab a police officer‚Äôs side arm at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Saturday. When asked why, he told police: ‚ÄúTo shoot and kill Trump,‚Äù according to U.S. court papers.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs never shown any violent tendencies before. He‚Äôs never been a bad person,‚Äù his father, Paul Davey, was quoted as saying by the MailOnline website which put Sandford‚Äôs age as 20. U.S. prosecutors have said he is 19.   ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a nice kid and literally wouldn‚Äôt hurt a fly - he used to tell us not to use fly spray because he didn‚Äôt want any flies to die.‚Äù The Mirror newspaper‚Äôs website quoted Davey as saying his son had Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome and had left school at the age of 15 ‚Äúbecause he couldn‚Äôt cope with it all‚Äù.  He went to the United States 18 months ago after an American girl he had met returned home, something that had made him ‚Äúquite down and depressed,‚Äù Davey said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been refusing to come back and we were worried about him, we were in contact with the American Embassy ... (but) the American authorities said ‚Äòhe‚Äôs over 18 we can‚Äôt do anything.‚Äô‚Äù Davey said someone must have coerced or ‚Äúradicalised‚Äù his son into attacking the presidential candidate. ‚ÄúHe has never mentioned Donald Trump. The reason it is such a shock is because he shows no interest in anything like that ... I doubt he would even know who the president of the United States is.‚Äù Sandford lived on his own in Dorking, a commuter town near London, in a flat in a large white house. A local who knew Sandford‚Äôs mother, who did not want to be named, told Reuters Sandford had autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  ‚ÄúHe was one of those guys who just stays in his room that‚Äôs it, wouldn‚Äôt come out,‚Äù the man said.  The U.S. court documents said Sandford had been planning to kill Trump for about a year. He had visited a gun range the day before the rally to fire a weapon for the first time.  Last week, a British member of parliament was shot and stabbed to death in the street - an incident that has shocked a country that has strict gun controls and where attacks on public figures are rare. Media reported that Sandford and his mother had taken part in a ‚ÄúRobot Wars‚Äù competition where contestants operate robots trying to destroy their opponents‚Äô machine. A web page for the Fighting Robots Association listed Michael and Lynne Sandford and Paul Davey as owners of a number of robots, including machines named ‚ÄòMr Nasty‚Äô, ‚ÄòX-Terminator‚Äô and ‚ÄòSteel Avenger‚Äô.  ‚ÄúHe was quite active in the robot community for a while - buying famous robots from the show ... I then got them working for him because he had absolutely no idea about robots,‚Äù John Findlay, director of the company behind Robot Wars, told the Mirror newspaper.   ‚ÄúHe was calm, very quiet, a little bit weird and reserved.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 "
Obama pick to lead U.S. military in Africa favors powers to strike Islamic State,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs nominee to lead the U.S. military in Africa on Tuesday backed the idea of gaining greater power to strike Islamic State, including in Libya, which he described as the group‚Äôs Plan B as it loses territory in Iraq and Syria. Marine Lieutenant General Thomas Waldhauser told his Senate confirmation hearing that the U.S. military was making preparations for possible military strikes in Libya against the militants. But Waldhauser noted limitations on the current commander‚Äôs ability to order strikes against the group in Libya, which require adhering to White House guidance. That differs from the rules of engagement in Iraq or Syria. Asked by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham whether it would be wise for Obama to give the commander of the Africa Command the authority to go after Islamic State targets in Africa ‚Äúon your own,‚Äù Waldhauser said: ‚ÄúIt would be wise.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt would certainly contribute to what we‚Äôre trying to do inside Libya,‚Äù he responded. Islamic State established a presence in several parts of the country from 2014, and has been active between Benghazi and the militant group‚Äôs coastal stronghold of Sirte, about 380 km (240 miles) to the west. In recent weeks, however, the ultra-hardline group has retreated into the center of Sirte after forces aligned with Libya‚Äôs U.N.-backed unity government advanced from the western city of Misrata. One reason Islamic State established itself in Sirte, Waldhauser told the Senate Armed Services Committee, was ‚Äúto be kind of a backup if Iraq and Syria fail,‚Äù he said.  Waldhauser estimated that Islamic State faced between 3,000 and 4,000 opponents fighting the group around Sirte, drawn from the Mirsratan militia forces and the Petroleum Facilities Guard Central Branch.  But he cautioned that alliances can shift among the Libyan militia, driven by everything from tribal ties and religious beliefs to material gain. ‚ÄúThe unpredictable nature of paramilitary group patronage will most likely remain a significant obstacle to the GNA‚Äôs efforts to establish sovereignty,‚Äù he said in written testimony. For months, the United States has had a small number of U.S. forces rotating in and out of Libya, establishing contact with fighters inside the country.  Waldhauser said they were acting in an advisory role to support the unity government, and said no more U.S. troops were needed in the country at this time. ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 "

"Trump doubles monthly campaign fundraising, lags Clinton","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign raised $3.1 million from donors in May, more than doubling previous monthly hauls as he began soliciting donations to battle Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. But with spending that outpaced inflows, the New York real estate magnate‚Äôs campaign began June with just $1.29 million in cash, putting it well-behind Clinton‚Äôs $42 million war chest, according to federal disclosures filed late on Monday.  Clinton‚Äôs campaign raised $26 million in May.  The figures underscore the huge money advantage Clinton is hoping to enjoy leading into the Nov. 8 election, one that could allow her a large staff and millions of dollars of television and digital ads in battleground states. Trump, who has self-funded most of his campaign and only held his first general election fundraiser on May 25, is betting he can run a race that builds on his low-spending, insurgent primary operation. Trump‚Äôs surrogates, however, have said the cash is now ‚Äúpouring in‚Äù for the general election. For months the biggest cash injections into Trump‚Äôs campaign coffers were from his personal bank accounts. He has loaned his campaign $46 million since launching last year. Trump may still have several hurdles to cross before convincing deep-pocketed donors to write the kind of checks that would make him competitive with Clinton‚Äôs campaign bank account. Trump donors, allies and other Republican operatives continue to express concerns about his campaign operation, which has been dogged by internal battles, a threadbare campaign infrastructure of about 30 paid staffers, and a barely existent fundraising apparatus. On Monday, Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who had been tasked with overseeing the campaign‚Äôs fundraising arm.  The primary Super PAC supporting Trump, Great America PAC, reported raising $1.4 million in May - accounting for most of the $2.5 million the group has raised this year. The PAC had $500,971 cash remaining at the beginning of June. Clinton‚Äôs cash advantage has been fueled in part by the Super PAC supporting her. Priorities USA raised $12 million in the last month, ending May with a $52 million in cash. Three unions, AFT Solidarity, Liuna Building America and International Union of Operating Engineers, each gave $1 million. The group has largely been tasked with attacking Trump. And so far, they have spent more than $5.7 million this year on television ads alone attacking the Republican.

Senate rejects gun-control measures after Orlando shooting,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Monday rejected four measures restricting gun sales after last week‚Äôs massacre in an Orlando nightclub, dealing a bitter setback to advocates who have failed to get even modest gun curbs through Congress despite repeated mass shootings. A group of senators was still hoping to forge a compromise for later in the week aimed at keeping firearms away from people on terrorism watch lists, although that effort faced an uphill battle with critics in both parties skeptical about its chances. Last week‚Äôs massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, had intensified pressure on lawmakers, who moved swiftly to take the issue to the Senate floor. But the gun-control measures lost in largely party-line votes that showed the lingering political power in Congress of gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association. Republicans and their allies in the NRA gun lobby said the Democratic bills were too restrictive and trampled on the constitutional right to bear arms. Democrats attacked the Republicans‚Äô two proposals as too weak and accused them of being in the thrall of the NRA. ‚ÄúWhat am I going to tell the community of Orlando?‚Äù asked Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida after the votes. ‚ÄúSadly, what I‚Äôm going to tell them is the NRA won again.‚Äù Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, attacked the Democrats‚Äô amendments and thanked Republicans for rejecting them. ‚ÄúToday, the American people witnessed an embarrassing display in the United States,‚Äù he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the Democratic measures were ineffective and Republican senators ‚Äúare pursuing real solutions that can help keep Americans safer from the threat of terrorism.‚Äù As the parties remain largely locked in their positions,  polls show Americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than 310 million weapons, about one for every citizen.  The issue is already a prominent one for voters in November elections. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton supports new gun restrictions, while Republican Donald Trump expressed a willingness to talk to the NRA about the issue. After the votes, Clinton issued a one-word statement: ‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù It was followed by the names and ages of the dead in Orlando. Gun control efforts failed after mass shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and a conference center in San Bernardino, California, in 2015. But some senators see resistance to gun restrictions softening as national security looms larger in the debate. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the militant group Islamic State as he killed 49 people in a gay nightclub.  ‚ÄúThis country is under attack ... it‚Äôs not a plane or an explosive device, it‚Äôs an assault weapon,‚Äù said Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat who led a 15-hour filibuster last week to draw attention to the effort to restrict guns. Murphy walked off the floor after the Senate votes and embraced Erica Smegielski, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, a Sandy Hook principal killed during the Newtown shooting. ‚ÄúHe said, the good thing about me and you is we‚Äôre young, we‚Äôll be at this a long time,‚Äù said Smegielski, 30. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last week found that 71 percent of Americans favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on gun sales. That compared with 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014. Senior Senate aides left open the possibility of other votes later in the week on unspecified gun control proposals. Some Republicans pinned hopes on a proposal by Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, which was not one of the four bills being considered on Monday. Collins‚Äô plan would restrict gun purchases to a narrow group of suspects, including those on a ‚Äúno-fly‚Äù list or a ‚Äúselectee‚Äù list of people who require additional screening at airports.. But Democratic aides said people credibly suspected of involvement in terrorism would not be covered by the weapons ban under Collins‚Äô bill, and a Republican aide indicated it would not do enough to protect the constitutional rights of gun buyers. Even if the Senate approved a gun compromise, it would also have to be passed by the more conservative, Republican-majority House of Representatives. House Republican leadership aides did not comment on the possibility that any bills proposing gun restrictions would be considered on the House floor this week. On Monday, all four of the measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales to those on terrorism watch lists - two put forth by Democrats and two by Republicans - fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100-member chamber. Gun-control advocates expressed disappointment after the vote and vowed to take revenge on lawmakers at the ballot box in November. ‚ÄúShame on every single senator who voted against these life-saving amendments and protected the rights of terrorists and other dangerous people to buy guns,‚Äù said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ‚ÄúThe Brady Campaign will expose these politicians for who they really are and call out their failure to disarm hate in America.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 20, 2016 "
Trump fires campaign manager in shakeup for election push,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump fired Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager who helped him win Republican presidential nominating contests but clashed with other advisers on how to appeal to the broader general electorate, several people with knowledge of the decision said on Monday. The firing on Monday morning was another shakeup for a campaign already at odds with many senior Republican figures over the presumptive nominee‚Äôs policies, with the party‚Äôs nominating convention in Cleveland less than a month away.  But it may also prove a step toward calming concerns among party leaders about Trump, a wealthy businessman and political outsider, and the conflicting advice he was getting from senior aides, as he battles presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Trump said Lewandowski did ‚Äúa great job‚Äù but ‚Äúit‚Äôs time now for a different kind of a campaign.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe ran a small, beautiful, well-unified campaign. It worked very well in the primaries. I think I‚Äôm probably going to do some of that,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with Fox News, in which he did not say if Lewandowski had been fired. Three people close to the campaign said some of Trump‚Äôs staff viewed Lewandowski as opposing strategic changes and staff hires urged for the general election campaign by Paul Manafort, a strategist hired in April partly for his experience on presidential campaigns that Lewandowski lacked. The three, a campaign staffer and two people in regular contact with Trump advisers, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by Trump to discuss the firing. Manafort will take over as campaign manager, said Carl Paladino, co-chairman of the campaign‚Äôs operations in New York state. ‚ÄúPaul‚Äôs in charge,‚Äù Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee‚Äôs communications director, said in an interview. Trump‚Äôs decision to fire his manager came in part at the urging of his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who have powerful advisory roles in the campaign, the two people in contact with Trump aides said.  Hope Hicks, who single-handedly fields Trump‚Äôs media inquiries, disputed reports she had complained about Lewandowski to Ivanka Trump. ‚ÄúThat is entirely untrue,‚Äù she said. Lewandowski, 42, had been a near-constant presence at Trump‚Äôs side since the New York developer launched his campaign on June 2015.  In a brief statement read on CNN, Lewandowski said: ‚ÄúI stand by the fact that Mr. Trump is a great candidate and is better than Hillary Clinton ever will be.‚Äù  Lewandowski denied there were any tensions between him and Trump‚Äôs family in an interview with CNN. Later on Monday, a campaign adviser resigned after reveling in Lewandowski‚Äôs exit on his Twitter account, CNN reported. ‚ÄúDing dong the witch is dead!‚Äù Michael Caputo, the adviser, wrote shortly after reports of the firing emerged. He later released a statement to CNN saying he had resigned. ‚ÄúIn hindsight, that was too exuberant a reaction to this personnel move,‚Äù his statement said. The RNC spokesman did not think there would be a change in Trump‚Äôs tone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be more of a streamlined effort and more of an understanding of the difference that a general election has,‚Äù Spicer said. Clinton‚Äôs campaign has hundreds more staff than that of Trump. In contrast to her unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid, there has been no public sign this time of any significant infighting among her advisers. The former U.S. secretary of state has also spent millions of dollars on television commercials in recent weeks. Trump has not aired any paid advertisements since becoming the presumptive nominee, preferring to spread his message through his Twitter account and in media interviews. Trump has faced setbacks in the past two weeks. His renewed calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States have drawn heavy criticism from Republican politicians in Washington and prompted corporate sponsors like Apple and JPMorgan Chase to withhold funding from the party‚Äôs July 18-21 convention. Recent opinion polls show at least half of all voters approve of the Muslim ban. Lewandowski, a former New Hampshire field director for a conservative advocacy group, argued that Trump‚Äôs unconventional campaigning style did not need to be changed after it proved successful in the last few months of primary contests. Lewandowski repeatedly defended that strategy with a line that became his mantra: ‚ÄúLet Trump be Trump.‚Äù  Known for his brusque manner, Lewandowski was accused of manhandling a female reporter in Florida during the primary campaign, but the battery charge against him was later dropped. He is still scheduled to attend the Cleveland convention as chairman of New Hampshire‚Äôs delegation. The Democratic National Committee said Lewandowski‚Äôs exit was unlikely to change Trump. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt Corey Lewandowski who called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States,‚Äù Mark Paustenbach, a party spokesman, said in a statement, ‚Äúit was Donald Trump.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 20, 2016 "
Man arrested at Trump rally said he wanted to shoot candidate: court papers,"(Reuters) - A man arrested over the weekend trying to wrestle a gun from a police officer at a Las Vegas rally held by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told an investigator he wanted to kill the candidate, court papers showed on Monday. Michael Steven Sandford, who prosecutors described as a 19-year-old British national, was arrested on Saturday at the Treasure Island hotel in Las Vegas after trying to disarm the officer, according to Las Vegas police. According to court papers filed on Monday in federal court in Nevada, Sandford told a Secret Service agent he had driven to Las Vegas from California with the goal of shooting Trump. ‚ÄúSandford claimed he had been attempting to kill Trump for about a year but decided to act on this occasion because he finally felt confident about trying it,‚Äù the court papers said. He was charged with committing an act of violence on restricted ground, Natalie Collins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office, said in an email. Sandford has not entered a plea and is scheduled to be in court for a preliminary hearing on July 5, Collins said. Sandford‚Äôs federal public defender, Heather Fraley, could not be immediately reached for comment. Sandford said he had been in the United States for a year and a half, the documents showed. The records said he had lived in Hoboken, New Jersey, after coming to the country. Court records said Sandford went to the Battlefield Vegas gun range last Friday to practice shooting, adding that he had never fired a gun before. While there, he fired 20 rounds from a Glock 9 mm handgun, the records said. Sandford told investigators that if he were ‚Äúon the street tomorrow,‚Äù he would try again, the documents said.

'Economikes': the gatekeepers of Clinton‚Äôs economic policy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has no shortage of economic advisors. Scores of world-class experts pour ideas into her campaign on the policies she should champion in her bid for the White House. But before much of the input reaches the Democratic candidate, it is filtered through a pair of staffers known inside the campaign as the ‚ÄúEconomikes.‚Äù Working out of Clinton‚Äôs campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, Michael Shapiro and Michael Schmidt are helping shape what could be a lasting economic agenda if the former secretary of state overcomes Republican rival Donald Trump in November‚Äôs election. In an interview with Reuters, Shapiro and Schmidt described Clinton‚Äôs process for forming policy by broadly soliciting ideas and crafting them into the action points that she takes to voters.  Before Clinton takes a position, Shapiro said, ‚Äúshe wants to know we have talked to and gotten input from everyone, making sure that we‚Äôre consulting with labor, making sure that we‚Äôre consulting with experts.‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs inclusive approach to developing policy positions has been faulted for being slow and unwieldy. Much of the work of sifting through the wealth of sometimes disparate ideas and data it yields falls to the Economikes. Both are recent graduates of Yale Law School. Prior to joining the campaign, Schmidt, 30, worked at the U.S. Treasury Department and the Yale Investments Office, helping manage the university‚Äôs endowment. Shapiro, 29, worked at the White House for the National Economic Council. Earlier this year, he married the daughter of New York Senator Chuck Schumer. The pair helps Clinton draw upon a deep bench of advisers, including economist Alan Krueger, Duke professor Aaron Chatterji and Simon Johnson, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, along with scores of other academics and business people.  Some communicate regularly through emails, conference calls, meetings and memos. Others are tapped once or twice for specific expertise. Frequent contributor Alan Blinder, the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he will ‚Äúusually email the Mikes‚Äù with ideas. The fruit of the process will be on display today in Ohio, where Clinton is expected to give a speech contrasting her economic vision with that of Trump, a businessman who often names himself as his main adviser and is known for his off-the-cuff style. Clinton has called raising middle class incomes the defining economic challenge of the time. So far, she has presented a mix of goals, including making child care more affordable and boosting jobs. Some business leaders have said her approach is reassuring, but progressives have criticized her policies as too moderate. Trump, in contrast, often has taken business leaders by surprise with his policy proposals. He has promised to renegotiate international trade deals to pump up U.S. manufacturing, vowed to penalize companies that move their headquarters abroad to avoid taxes, and pledged to dismantle Obama‚Äôs financial regulation reforms. ¬†¬†¬†While the ‚ÄúEconomikes‚Äù nickname began as a joke, Shapiro said the campaign‚Äôs digital team made it stick by using it in a Q&A posted on Clinton‚Äôs web site. Their bosses, senior policy advisers Jake Sullivan and Maya Harris, have been known to stick their heads out of their offices and ask for ‚Äúone of the Mikes.‚Äù On email chains, CC: notes will sometimes include ‚Äúplus the Economikes.‚Äù Humor aside, their work often is serious business. After the tainted water crisis hit national headlines in January, Clinton dispatched Schmidt and her political director, Amanda Renteria, to Flint, Michigan to investigate.  Schmidt said the effort informed Clinton‚Äôs approach to the water crisis during the Democratic debate in Flint, including her call for the governor to resign. ¬†¬†¬†¬†In other cases, they said, Clinton will ask the pair to research issues she‚Äôs heard on the campaign trail, such as the case of an Iowa bowling alley owner who told the candidate student debt made it hard for him to get business loans. The campaign since has rolled out proposals to allow for refinancing of student debt and the use of income-based repayment programs to cut monthly payments. Shapiro and Schmidt said the policy points they bring back to Clinton typically lead her to ask more questions, a process that can go on for several rounds before the candidate finally settles on a policy proposal.

The move, made via an amendment to a criminal justice appropriations bill, is an effort by Senate Republicans to respond to last week‚Äôs mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub after a series of measures to restrict guns offered by both parties failed on Monday. ‚ÄúIn the wake of the tragic massacre in Orlando, it is important our law enforcement have the tools they need to conduct counterterrorism investigations,‚Äù Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and sponsor of the amendment, said in a statement.  The bill is also supported by Republican Senators John Cornyn, Jeff Sessions and Richard Burr, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. Privacy advocates denounced the effort, saying it seeks to exploit a mass shooting in order to expand the government‚Äôs digital spying powers. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, criticized a similar effort last month as one that ‚Äútakes a hatchet to important protections for Americans‚Äô liberty.‚Äù The amendment would broaden the FBI‚Äôs authority to use so-called National Security Letters to include electronic communications transaction records such as time stamps of emails and the emails‚Äô senders and recipients. The Obama administration for years has lobbied for a change to how NSLs can be used, after a 2008 legal memo from the Justice Department said the law limits them largely to phone billing records. FBI Director James Comey has said the change essentially corrects a typo and is a top legislative priority for his agency. NSLs do not require a warrant and are almost always accompanied by a gag order preventing the service provider from sharing the request with a targeted user. The letters have existed since the 1970s, though the scope and frequency of their use expanded greatly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The amendment filed Monday would also make permanent a provision of the USA Patriot Act that allows the intelligence community to conduct surveillance on ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù suspects who do not have confirmed ties to a foreign terrorist group. That provision, which the Justice Department said last year had never been used, is currently set to expire in December 2019. A vote is expected no later than Wednesday, McConnell‚Äôs office said.

"American Muslims see Trump rhetoric fueling prejudice, hate incidents","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About three months ago, Sarah Ibrahim‚Äôs son came home from his fourth-grade class at a Maryland school with a disturbing question. ‚ÄúWill I have time to say goodbye to you before you‚Äôre deported?‚Äù he said, according to Ibrahim, a Muslim Arab American who works at a federal government agency in Maryland. ‚ÄúThe kids in his classroom were saying: ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs going to leave when Trump becomes president?‚Äô‚Äù said the 35-year-old mother. The incident happened a few months after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ‚Äî now the presumptive nominee ‚Äî first called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and for more scrutiny at mosques after 14 people were killed in San Bernardino by a Muslim couple whom the FBI said had been radicalized. Trump intensified his anti-Muslim rhetoric after last week‚Äôs mass shooting in Orlando, in which a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub, calling for a suspension of immigration from countries with ‚Äúa proven history of terrorism‚Äù. He reiterated his call for more surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were ‚Äútrying to take over our children.‚Äù  While Democratic and several Republican leaders have distanced themselves from Trump‚Äôs comments, many American Muslims say his stance has fueled an atmosphere in which some may feel they can voice prejudices or attack Muslims without fear of retribution. ‚ÄúWhat Trump did was make these hidden thoughts public. He gave people permission to speak out loud, he removed the shame associated with being prejudiced. People know that they won‚Äôt be punished,‚Äù Ibrahim told Reuters at a community iftar, the sundown meal during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Trump‚Äôs campaign did not respond to Reuters‚Äô request for comment. Trump has rejected the criticism that his rhetoric is racist, and has said he is often misunderstood by the media and his opponents. A report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations and University of California, Berkeley released on Monday said the number of recorded incidents in which mosques were targeted jumped to 78 in 2015, the most since the body began tracking them in 2009. There were 20 and 22 such incidents in the previous two years, respectively. The incidents include verbal threats and physical attacks. Corey Saylor, CAIR‚Äôs director of the department to monitor and combat Islamophobia, said there had been a spike in Islamophobic incidents in the wake of Orlando, including those  targeting mosques. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs rhetoric is a direct threat to American principles. He has mainstreamed anti-Constitutional ideas like banning or surveilling people based on faith,‚Äù Saylor told Reuters. ‚ÄúSuch divisive rhetoric contributes to a toxic environment in which some people take the law into their own hands and attack people of institutions they perceive as Muslim.‚Äù CAIR says the last big spike in incidents targeting mosques was seen in 2010 following the controversy over locating an Islamic center near the site of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York. It said that lent ‚Äúadditional weight to the argument that levels of anti-Muslim sentiment follow trends in domestic U.S. politics, not international terrorism‚Äù. American rabbis and preachers have also denounced Trump‚Äôs rhetoric. Anti-Semitic incidents in the United States still outstrip those against Muslims. The Anti-Defamation League said last year there were 912 anti-Semitic incidents across the United States during the 2014 calendar year, up 21 percent from 2013. ‚ÄúIf Muslims are not free and safe in America, then Christians and Jews are not free and safe in America,‚Äù said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism. Trump has also drawn criticism for his rhetoric against Latino immigrants, saying early in his campaign that Mexican ‚Äúrapists‚Äù and other criminals were coming across the border and calling for all undocumented immigrants to be deported. Manal Omar, a Muslim-American author based in Washington, said she has stopped taking the metro and walking alone late at night. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt dismiss the tweets and angry messages I‚Äôve received from right wing militants,‚Äù said Omar, who says she has grown especially vigilant after last week‚Äôs murder of British lawmaker Jo Cox, whom she knew. A few days after the San Bernardino attack, Ilhaam Hassan‚Äôs family restaurant was burned down in an arson attack in Grand Forks, North Dakota.  Matthew Gust pleaded guilty in May to federal hate-crime and arson charges. He admitted to setting the fire because of the national origin of the employees and customers at the restaurant ‚Äî a focal point of the local Somali-American community. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to expect if he (Trump) becomes the president,‚Äù Hassan said. ‚ÄúHe is against minorities. He is against Islam. It‚Äôs not a message of unity, it‚Äôs a message of dividing the country and that is not what America is based on.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 20, 2016 "
"In separate speeches Obama, Biden, Carter target Trump policies","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, his vice president and defense secretary took aim on Monday at policies of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump they said would alienate Muslims globally along with U.S. allies and neighbors. In a speech focusing on national security at a think tank in Washington, Vice President Joe Biden said Trump‚Äôs calls to bar the entry of Muslims and to profile Muslim Americans reflected the politics of fear and intolerance. ‚ÄúThere are 1.4 billion Muslims in the world‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúSome of the rhetoric I‚Äôm hearing sounds designed to radicalize all 1.4 billion.‚Äù    Biden‚Äôs attacks on Trump as an isolationist, and others by Obama and Defense Secretary Ash Carter represent an unusually early and vigorous assault on an opposing party‚Äôs presidential nominee. The election is on Nov. 8. Referring to Trump‚Äôs vow to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico if elected, Biden said that the most complex threats do not respect borders and a wall would destroy much of the progress the Obama administration had made with U.S. neighbors. ‚ÄúIf we build walls and disrespect our neighbors, we will quickly see all this progress evaporating, replaced by a return of anti-Americanism, a corrosive rift throughout our hemisphere,‚Äù Biden said. Obama, who last week assailed Trump for what he called a ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù mindset and ‚Äúloose talk and sloppiness‚Äù in defining the country‚Äôs enemies, on Monday criticized  Trump‚Äôs anti-trade policies in a speech at a U.S. Commerce Department conference. ‚ÄúThis is not just about jobs and trade, it‚Äôs not just about hard, cold cash.¬†It‚Äôs also about building relationships across borders,‚Äù Obama told the 2,400 people from 70 countries at the conference to attract foreign investment. Trump has threatened to impose steep tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports and demanded a change in a U.S. trade policy he says allows other countries to shut out U.S imports, devalue their currencies and unfairly target U.S. industries. Speaking at the same event as Biden, Carter said a critical part of U.S. leadership is its ‚Äúlongtime network of allies and partners in every corner of the world.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur allies around the world have stood with us - and fought with us - time and again, most recently in Iraq, Afghanistan, and against ISIL,‚Äù he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. Carter did not mention Trump, who has called NATO ‚Äúobsolete‚Äù and said he would consider letting Japan and South Korea develop their own nuclear weapons rather than relying on the United States for protection against North Korea and China.While Obama, Carter and other top officials generally have refrained from attacking Trump by name, Obama administration spokesmen have not denied that such remarks are directed at the presumptive Republican candidate.

Obama takes turn as 'America's pitch man' to help sell TPP trade deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama made a plug on Monday for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal to a group of 2,400 investors looking at locating business in the United States, saying the deal would help boost the global economy. Trade has become a hot-button issue in the Nov. 8 presidential election campaign, with presumptive candidates from both parties voicing objections to the 12-nation TPP deal that Obama wants the U.S. Congress to sign off on before his time in office ends on Jan. 20. Both the Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns have tapped into populist skepticism about the benefit of trade deals on jobs and wages, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Obama tried to dispel the economic gloom-and-doom coming from the campaign trail, extolling the recovery of the United States from recession. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind being America‚Äôs pitch man,‚Äù Obama said in a speech at the SelectUSA Summit. ‚ÄúIn seven months or so, I‚Äôll be on the job market, and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm going to be here. I‚Äôm going to get on LinkedIn and see what comes up,‚Äù he quipped. Obama argued that while there are legitimate concerns about boosting wages and improving working conditions, ultimately  global trade can help connect people from around the world and reduce poverty. ‚ÄúThis is not just about jobs and trade, it‚Äôs not just about hard cold cash,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about building relationships across borders. When your companies come together you help bring countries and cultures together.‚Äù   American business lobby groups have been pushing the White House and congressional leaders to finish their work to ratify the TPP before the next administration takes office. Obama‚Äôs top economic adviser sidestepped a question on a conference call about the timeline. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre continuing to work with congressional leaders to find the right opportunity, the right window of opportunity, to get TPP passed this year,‚Äù Jeff Zients, the director of the National Economic Council, told reporters. On Monday, Obama announced a $70 million matching grant to a Los Angeles ‚Äúmanufacturing hub,‚Äù a group of businesses and researchers piloting sensors and other technology to help factories cut costs and energy use. It is the ninth of 15 planned hubs that the White House hopes will boost manufacturing across the country.

U.S. Latino voter group to get free ad space on Telemundo boxing program,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A leading U.S. promoter of Latino boxing, All Star Boxing Inc, will give free television advertising space to Hispanic civic group Mi Familia Vota, which openly criticizes Donald Trump‚Äôs anti-immigration stance, in an effort to encourage Latino Americans to vote in November‚Äôs presidential election. The partnership will put the name and website of the group on signs in boxing ring corners and on T-shirts worn by the athletes on Spanish language network Telemundo‚Äôs Boxeo Telemundo program, starting at the end of June, officials at both organizations told Reuters. The partnership will be announced on Tuesday. ‚ÄúDesperate times call for desperate measures,‚Äù said Ruben De Jesus, the director of operations at Florida-based All Star Boxing, referring to this year‚Äôs presidential election. He said he decided to contact Mi Familia Vota with the offer of free advertising after hearing ‚Äújust the whole rhetoric with regards to the Hispanic community‚Äù in the current election.  He did not mention any candidate by name.  ‚ÄúOur platform is not to tell our Latino citizens who to vote for, but it‚Äôs important that this year especially we engage,‚Äù he told Reuters in an interview, adding the free advertising space could reach as many as 5 million people. Ben Monterroso, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, was blunter about the partnership‚Äôs aim. ‚ÄúI think Mr. Donald Trump lives in another world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn my experience working with the community, a big majority of the people that I talk to, they definitely don‚Äôt like what Donald Trump has done.‚Äù Trump, the Republican who will likely face Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election, launched his candidacy last year by calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration from Mexico, a country he said was sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States.  The wealthy New York businessman has also repeatedly vowed to build a wall along the border and force the Mexican government to pay for it if elected. More recently Trump angered Latinos by criticizing a federal judge overseeing a fraud trial against Trump University, calling the Indiana-born man a Mexican and, later, saying his Mexican heritage meant he couldn‚Äôt do his job properly. Trump has rejected accusations that his comments are racist and has said he is well-liked by Hispanics. A spokeswoman for Trump was not immediately available to comment. The partnership between All Star Boxing and Mi Familia Vota will begin on June 24 and run for four events this summer, then another four events after a brief hiatus, comprising 128 boxers in total, De Jesus said.  Half the shows will take place in Florida and half in Mexico. The fighters will also hold local events in Florida to boost voter engagement in the critical swing state, De Jesus said. That could include visits to political events around Tampa and Orlando, such as helping to register voters. ‚ÄúThe boxers are coming out of their corners to fight for the community,‚Äù Monterroso said. Boxeo Telemundo, with an over 25-year history, calls itself the most-watched Spanish-language boxing show in the United States. The show attracts an average 550,000 viewers weekly, especially among men 18 to 49, De Jesus said.

"Biden to rebuke Trump foreign policy ideas, defend Obama strategy","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Joe Biden on Monday will denounce Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs call for a halt to Muslim immigration as an appeal to intolerance and defend the U.S. fight against Islamic State at a time of dissent within the Obama administration over Syria policy. Biden will deliver a wide-ranging rebuke to Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, in a speech to the Center for New American Security think tank, according to excerpts released by the White House. Biden, who has joined President Barack Obama in endorsing presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, plans to wade deeper into the campaign a week after Trump sparked criticism for his comments on American Muslims after a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In a speech last Monday on national security, Trump stood by his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and proposed a suspension of immigration from countries with ‚Äúa proven history of terrorism.‚Äù      Biden, in his remarks, will say: ‚ÄúWielding the politics of fear and intolerance - like proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States or slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism - calls into question America‚Äôs status as the greatest democracy in the history of the world.‚Äù   Although not naming Trump, the vice president will say: ‚ÄúAlienating 1.5 billion Muslims - the vast, vast majority of whom, at home and abroad, are peace-loving - will only make the problem worse.‚Äù Biden will also apparently chide Trump for having spoken admiringly of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúEmbracing Putin at a time of renewed Russian aggression‚Äù could call into question the U.S. commitment to Europe‚Äôs security,‚Äù he will say. Referring to Trump‚Äôs vow to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico if elected, Biden will assert: ‚ÄúIf we build walls and disrespect our closest neighbors,‚Äù it will reignite anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Biden‚Äôs defense of Obama‚Äôs strategy against Islamic State militants appears intended, at least in part, to push back against a recently leaked internal State Department memo critical of the president‚Äôs response to Syria‚Äôs civil war. The document, signed by 51 diplomats and reflecting long-standing frustration among Obama‚Äôs aides, calls for urgently broadening an approach, now focused on attacking Islamic State, to unleash air strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs forces. U.S. officials made clear Obama would not be swayed. ‚ÄúThe use of force should be precise and proportional,‚Äù Biden will say. ‚ÄúThere must be a clear mission that advances U.S. interests.

U.S. justices to mull president's power to nominate officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to review a lower court decision that invalidated part of a former U.S. labor board official‚Äôs tenure, in a case that could curb the next president‚Äôs power to staff top positions in his or her administration. The justices will hear an appeal of a 2015 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit saying that once President Barack Obama nominated Lafe Solomon in 2011 to be general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Solomon should not have continued to fill the position on a temporary or ‚Äúacting‚Äù basis pending Senate confirmation. The appeals court said a 1998 federal law bars anyone from serving in an acting role while they are the nominee unless they were previously the ‚Äúfirst assistant‚Äù to that post. The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in the case could decide if the White House can temporarily fill high-level administration positions with nominees waiting for confirmation, which could take on added importance if the next president faces protracted nomination battles in the Senate. The case will give the Supreme Court a second chance to weigh in on executive branch authority related to filling positions at the NLRB. In 2014, the court in NLRB v. Noel Canning ruled that three 2013 appointments Obama made to the board while Congress was in recess were invalid. Although Obama withdrew Solomon‚Äôs stalled nomination in 2013, about six current high-level officials are serving on an acting basis while they await a Senate vote, including officials at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, the NLRB said in its petition for review. Former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush also tapped officials to permanently fill the posts that they were manning in a temporary capacity, the NLRB said. Clinton, Bush and Obama all relied on an interpretation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act that viewed the restriction on first assistants as only applying to people who automatically become acting officers under a chain of command, rather than those nominated by the president, the NLRB said. But the D.C. Circuit, as well as the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2016 ruling, have disagreed. The case is NLRB v. SW General Inc, No. 15-1251, in the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump seeks to clarify comments on guns at Orlando nightclub,"(Reuters) - Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said he was referring to security staff, but not patrons, in comments that if more people had been armed during a Florida nightclub shooting last week, fewer would have died. ‚ÄúWhen I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees,‚Äù Trump said on Twitter on Monday.

Obama immigration win at Supreme Court could benefit Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If the U.S. Supreme Court in the coming days decides a high-profile immigration case in favor of the Obama administration, the ruling could have an unexpected beneficiary: Republican presidential contender Donald Trump.   The Obama administration is asking the high court to revive its 2014 proposal to protect up to 4 million people from deportation, a plan that was blocked by lower courts. The court could rule that a president has broad authority to interpret and enforce federal immigration law.  Such a ruling would allow Obama to implement his signature executive action on immigration, aimed at the parents of U.S. citizens‚Äô children, before he leaves office. It could also help Trump, who has put forth his own sweeping and controversial plans on immigration ahead of the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúTo the extent the court has language about the president‚Äôs wide authority in immigration law generally, that would certainly strengthen Trump‚Äôs hand.‚Äù said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law expert at Cornell Law School. The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling will come at a key phase in the presidential election cycle, with candidates Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton trading jabs over immigration policy following the mass shooting in a Orlando nightclub in which a gunman killed 49 people.  Trump has proposed curbing immigration from countries with a history of terrorism, blocking the entry of Muslims and deporting the estimated 11 million people in the United States who entered the country illegally.  If he wins the race for the White House, Trump might need to invoke his own executive authority - as happened with Obama - if the U.S. Congress does not approve his proposals, which have sparked outrage at home and abroad. The current case is unlikely to provide any support for Trump‚Äôs  proposal to bar Muslims, which legal experts say would face other legal hurdles because it targets people on the basis of religion. But legal experts say it could help Trump if he seeks to block entry from certain countries under a provision of immigration law that gives the president the power to suspend entry of noncitizens whose entry ‚Äúwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.‚Äù  That provision has previously only been used block entry of small groups of people, such as officials linked with foreign governments hostile to the United States. Applying it to entire countries could prompt a similar lawsuit to the one filed against Obama. Clinton could also seize on an Obama victory in the case, but her own immigration proposals are more modest. She has said that absent action by Congress to reform the system entirely, she would keep Obama‚Äôs program in place and seek to expand on it. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress passes laws and the executive branch enforces them. In the immigration context, Congress has traditionally given the president considerable leeway to interpret how to implement the laws. The high court, evenly split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, could decide the case on narrower grounds than the broad question of executive power.  It could avoid touching on immigration law at all by finding that the states challenging Obama‚Äôs proposal did not have legal standing to sue. The court could also split 4-4, which would leave in place the lower court decision blocking the plan but without setting any legal precedent.     U.S. presidents generally have discretion to enforce immigration law, but the plan‚Äôs challengers said Obama exceeded the limits of his authority by setting up a program that would allow millions to gain temporary legal status and work permits.  Critics say his plan was unlawful in part because it effectively granted relief from deportation to a much bigger class of people than had ever benefited from any similar programs in the past. Texas and 25 other states who filed suit said it was an unconstitutional abuse of power. Obama‚Äôs lawyers told the Supreme Court that Obama was acting within the government‚Äôs exercise of prosecutorial discretion to decide who to deport. ",politicsNews,"June 19, 2016 "
"Immigration, abortion, race rulings due at Supreme Court","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is heading into its home stretch, with major rulings due by the end of the month on President Barack Obama‚Äôs unilateral immigration plan, racial preferences in university admissions and a restrictive Texas abortion law. Producing decisive rulings has been complicated by the fact that the court has been down one justice since conservative Antonin Scalia died in February, leaving it evenly split with four conservatives and four liberals. The justices also are set to rule on whether to overturn Republican former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell‚Äôs 2014 corruption conviction, one of the 13 cases yet to be decided. The court appeared divided along ideological lines when it heard arguments on April 18 over whether Democrat Obama exceeded his constitutional powers in bypassing the Republican-led Congress with a 2014 plan to spare millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits. Twenty-six states led by Republican-governed Texas brought the lawsuit. A 4-4 ruling, which appeared to be one possibility after the arguments, would deal Obama a huge defeat because it would affirm a lower-court ruling invalidating the plan. Split rulings do not set nationwide legal precedents, but a 4-4 decision would effectively kill Obama‚Äôs immigration plan. The court also seemed split along ideological lines during March 2 arguments in a challenge to a Texas abortion law brought by abortion providers backed by the Obama administration. A 4-4 ruling would deliver a victory to Texas because it would affirm a lower-court ruling upholding the law. Because such a ruling would set no nationwide precedent, it might not serve as a legal blueprint for other conservative, Republican-dominated states to enact similar laws. The question before the justices is whether the law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to abortion as established in the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. There cannot be a 4-4 ruling in a challenge by a white woman, enlisted by a conservative legal activist, to a University of Texas student admissions policy giving preferences to racial minorities in a program aimed at fostering campus racial diversity. Only seven justices heard that case. Liberal Elena Kagan, the Obama administration‚Äôs solicitor general when it supported the university in earlier litigation, recused herself. That means four conservatives and three liberals will decide the case. Conservative justices expressed reservations about the affirmative action admissions policy during Dec. 9 arguments.

Trump says U.S. should mull more racial profiling after Orlando shooting,"(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States should consider more racial profiling, in response to a question about whether he supported greater law enforcement scrutiny of Muslim Americans after the Orlando mass shooting. ‚ÄúI think profiling is something that we‚Äôre going to have to start thinking about as a country,‚Äù Trump told CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou look at Israel and you look at others, and they do it and they do it successfully. And you know, I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to start using common sense,‚Äù he said when asked if he supported increased profiling of Muslims in America. Trump made similar comments last December about profiling, the targeting of specific demographic groups for extra scrutiny, after a Muslim American and his wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Last week, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, sparked criticism from many in his party for his comments on American Muslims after the Orlando attack on Sunday, in which a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub.  In a speech on national security on Monday, Trump stood by his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and proposed a suspension of immigration from countries with ‚Äúa proven history of terrorism.‚Äù  He also said the Muslim community had to ‚Äúcooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad.‚Äù  Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has said the comments show Trump is unfit to be president. The Florida gunman, Omar Mateen, was born in the United States to Afghan parents. During a three-hour siege at the club, he expressed support for Islamic State, but officials believe he was ‚Äúself-radicalized.‚Äù In his interview on Sunday, Trump said there were ‚Äúred flags‚Äù around Mateen, who had been investigated twice by the FBI but ultimately cleared.  Trump also reiterated his support for more scrutiny of mosques, saying that could resemble a controversial New York City surveillance program that has been shut down.  ‚ÄúIf you go to France right now, they‚Äôre doing it in France. In fact, in some instances they‚Äôre closing down mosques,‚Äù he said. Police in France closed some mosques shortly after gunmen aligned with Islamic State militants killed 130 people in Paris in a series of attacks on Nov. 13. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan endorsed Trump but has said a Muslim ban is not in U.S. interests. In excerpts of an NBC interview released on Friday, Ryan, the top elected U.S. Republican, said Republicans weighing whether to vote for Trump should follow their ‚Äúconscience.‚Äù Trump brushed off the criticism on Sunday and said he would put up his own money for his campaign if needed. ‚ÄúIt would be nice if the Republicans stuck together,‚Äù Trump said in an ABC interview. ‚ÄúI can win, one way or another.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 19, 2016 "
Supreme Court may take action on state assault weapon bans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court may weigh in this week on gun control, an issue smoldering again following the June 12 Orlando massacre, with the justices due to decide whether to hear a challenge by gun rights advocates to assault weapon bans in two states. The Connecticut and New York laws prohibit semiautomatic weapons like the one used by the gunman who fatally shot 49 people at a gay night club in Orlando in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Supreme Court will announce as soon as Monday whether it will hear the challenge brought by gun rights groups and individual firearms owners asserting that the laws violate the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs Second Amendment guarantee of the right to bear arms. The court has not decided a major gun case since 2010.  If they take up the matter, the justices would hear arguments in their next term, which begins in October. A decision not to hear the challenge would leave in place lower-court rulings upholding the laws. The court‚Äôs action in another recent appeal indicated it may be disinclined to take up the matter. The justices in December opted not to hear a challenge to a Highland Park, Illinois ordinance banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. A national assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Congressional Republicans, backed by the influential National Rifle Association gun rights lobby, beat back efforts to restore it. Some states and municipalities have enacted their own bans. In their petition asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, those challenging the Connecticut law said the type of weapons banned by the state are used in self-defense, hunting and recreational shooting. Connecticut said its law targets firearms disproportionately used in gun crime, ‚Äúparticularly the most heinous forms of gun violence.‚Äù It said people in Connecticut still can legally own more than 1,000 types of handguns, rifles and shotguns. There is a longstanding legal debate over the scope of Second Amendment rights. In the 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller case, the Supreme Court held for the first time that the Second Amendment guaranteed an individual‚Äôs right to bear arms, but the ruling applied only to firearms kept in the home for self-defense. That ruling did not involve a state law, applying only to federal regulations. Two years later, in the case McDonald v. City of Chicago, the court held that the Heller ruling covered individual gun rights in states. ",politicsNews,"June 19, 2016 "
Trump says Britain should leave EU: newspaper interview,"LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trump told Britons on Sunday he supported Brexit, repeating just days before the vote on June 23 that he thinks the UK would be better off outside the European Union. As the campaign to decide Britain‚Äôs EU membership restarted after a three-day hiatus following the killing of lawmaker Jo Cox, Trump, the presumptive Republican U.S. presidential candidate, said in a newspaper interview he was backing an ‚Äúout‚Äù vote.  ‚ÄúI would personally be more inclined to leave, for a lot of reasons like having a lot less bureaucracy,‚Äù he told the Sunday Times. ‚ÄúBut I am not a British citizen. This is just my opinion.‚Äù The billionaire businessman also told the newspaper that he would seek to have good relationships internationally if he were elected president in November, including with David Cameron. The British Prime Minister has in the past called Trump‚Äôs proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States ‚Äúdivisive, stupid and wrong‚Äù.  Trump said in May that Britain would be better off outside the EU because of high levels of migration. The latest opinion polls showed the ‚ÄòRemain‚Äô camp recovering some momentum, although the overall picture remains one of an evenly split electorate. Trump, whose mother was Scottish, is due to be in Britain the day after the referendum, when he visits two golf courses he owns in Scotland. Trump also said that if he became president he would try to improve the trade deals the U.S. has with China, and work more closely with Russia and that could include co-operating with Russia in the fight against Islamic State.

Democrats' new line on gun control: Do it for national security,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats pushing for gun curbs after the latest mass shooting in the United States are co-opting a Republican mantra to build public support and defang opposition: it‚Äôs time to get tough on national security. Shoring up national security has long been a pillar of Republican orthodoxy, as has staunch opposition to gun control. But the massacre of 49 people in Orlando, Florida, last Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, by a gunman who pledged loyalty to Islamist militants may be leaving Republicans on shakier ground. With national security driving the debate, Democrats see a more powerful argument than simply advocating the need to curb gun violence in a country of 320 million that has more than 310 million weapons. Although the Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed to have had no help from extremist Islamist groups in targeting a gay nightclub, he had been investigated by U.S. authorities for possible links to terrorism and subsequently cleared. That prompted Democrats to clamor for legislation to expand background checks and prevent people on U.S. terrorism watch lists from buying guns. Votes on four measures were scheduled Monday in the U.S. Senate, two sponsored by Democrats and two by Republicans. Many Republicans, and some Democrats, oppose strict gun curbs partly on constitutional grounds. ‚ÄúEvery senator is now going to have to say, whether they‚Äôre for terrorists getting guns or against terrorists getting guns,‚Äù Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer told reporters on Thursday. ‚ÄúThe terrorists that we need to fear are not on the streets of Aleppo, or Mosul or Fallujah. They‚Äôre on the streets of the United States and they will have guns unless we pass tough laws,‚Äù added Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson all took the tack this week that gun measures were a safeguard against terrorism. Republicans have long criticized Obama for not being tough enough on national security and doing more in the fight against Islamic State. The Orlando massacre and the San Bernardino, California shooting in December by a couple inspired by Islamic State  captured the attention of the American public in a way previous mass shootings have not, said Tom Diaz, a former member of the National Rifle Association gun rights lobby who now backs gun control. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve changed the dynamic of this whole issue,‚Äù said Diaz, an author and expert on terrorism and the gun industry. That shift in sentiment has heartened the families of the 20 elementary school children and six staff members killed in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012, who championed the last big, and ultimately unsuccessful push, on gun control. About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014. Diaz believes Republicans must look as if they care about keeping guns out of the hands of so-called homegrown extremists, while¬†balancing issues of due process and the Constitution‚Äôs Second Amendment right to bear arms that form the backbone of the NRA‚Äôs opposition to gun control. Republicans say new laws won‚Äôt necessarily keep weapons out of the hands of people intent on doing harm, and are keen to avoid twinning the two issues.  ‚ÄúThis is not a gun control issue,‚Äù U.S. Senator Ted Cruz  said on Thursday. ‚ÄúThis is a terrorism issue.‚Äù Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said Democrats ‚Äúmust be careful about overplaying their hand with rhetoric that could sound like government overreach to Americans who believe in the Second Amendment.‚Äù Even if the current efforts fail, the new push on national security may prove Democrats‚Äô best shot at eventually luring Republican support on an issue that has floundered for decades. ‚ÄúThis is a chance for the Democrats to talk in tough terms about safety and security and also to link that to the gun issue,‚Äù said Robert Spitzer, political science professor at State University of New York at Cortland.Some notable Republicans appeared willing this week to engage in the debate on gun control. The party‚Äôs presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, vowed to meet with the NRA to talk about ways to bar people on certain government watch lists from buying guns. The top Republican in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said he was open to suggestions from experts on how to prevent terrorism suspects from acquiring firearms and called the Orlando shooting a ‚Äúcalculated act of terror.‚Äù But it was unclear whether Trump or McConnell would throw their weight behind any measures acceptable to Democrats. Democratic U.S. Representative Jim Himes said he did not hold out great hope that the gun legislation would advance. ‚ÄúThe reason you won‚Äôt see a compromise anytime soon is because Congress actually acting in the wake of Orlando would be a tacit admission on the other side that guns had something to do with what happened in Orlando as opposed to ISIS,‚Äù he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

Clinton's lead over Trump slips after Florida shooting: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump chipped away at Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lead in the presidential race this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, as the candidates clashed over how to respond to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, showed Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump, her likely Republican rival in the November presidential election. That‚Äôs down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a ‚Äúproven history of terrorism‚Äù against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States. He also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Party‚Äôs general opposition to gun control. While Trump‚Äôs comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters. Some 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trump‚Äôs idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. Meanwhile, about 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014.   Clinton focused her response to the Orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat Islamic State and what she called ‚Äúradical jihadist terrorism,‚Äù while warning against demonizing Muslim-Americans. She also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons. As usual after a major attack, ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues. The poll‚Äôs five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton, while 34.8 percent supported Trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. On Sunday, Clinton‚Äôs support was at 46.6 percent, versus Trump‚Äôs 32.3 percent. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with adults living in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The political horserace poll included 1,133 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll‚Äôs accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 "
New York lawmakers vote to legalize fantasy sports games,"ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - Fantasy sports moved a step closer to being legal in New York on Saturday when lawmakers approved the daily and season-long games, clearing a path for FanDuel, DraftKings and others to offer them to millions of players in the state. The multibillion-dollar industry, where players draft fantasy teams for sports including football, basketball and baseball, has drawn increased scrutiny since last year with the attorneys general of several U.S. states, including New York, Illinois and Nevada, questioning the legality of the games. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had held off on pursuing litigation against the fantasy companies for what he claimed were illegal gambling operations, and the companies have suspended their ‚Äúgames of skill‚Äù while the proposed legislation was in train. New York‚Äôs Senate passed the measure 45-17 early Saturday morning, sending the legislation that regulates and taxes the operators of fantasy sports games to Governor Andrew Cuomo. It is unclear whether Cuomo will sign the legislation, which the Assembly passed on Friday.  Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game where players draft teams in live games played in just one evening or over a weekend, has boomed over the past decade. State Assembly Gaming Committee Chairman J. Gary Pretlow predicted Cuomo would endorse the bill, partly because many young New York voters play the fantasy games and because it would generate tax revenues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing for New Yorkers because there are more than three and half million participants, most of them millennials,‚Äù Pretlow said. DraftKings, which has dominated the industry along with FanDuel, praised the legislation as providing what it called a ‚Äúsensible framework for regulating our games‚Äù.  In a statement on Saturday, the company said it would resume operations soon with new rules that provide ‚Äúfairness and transparency at the core‚Äù of all its contests, assuming the governor signs the legislation. FanDuel pointed out that New York was the seventh state to pass a fantasy sports bill this year, following Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Virginia. ‚ÄúIt speaks to the popularity of our game‚Äù said Nigel Eccles, the company‚Äôs CEO and co-founder. The New York legislation calls for a 15 percent annual state tax on gross revenues of all sports fantasy contests with an entry fee. Another 0.5 percent will be assessed each year on the companies with a maximum of $50,000. State Senator John Bonacic, who sponsored the bill, estimates annual state revenues will be about $5.5 million, adding that the measure is ‚Äúgoing to make a lot of New Yorkers very happy‚Äù. The legislation survived heavy opposition from casino companies operating in New York. Opponents said it would weaken New York‚Äôs current gaming operations, including the horse racing industry which has been propped up by state government, by giving gamblers more options. After intense lobbying from the fantasy gaming industry, which retained former pro quarterbacks Jim Kelly and Vinny Testaverde to promote the games, lawmakers beat a June 30 deadline to set regulations. Schneiderman said in a statement on Saturday that he would enforce the law as amended, but his office would still pursue claims that DraftKings and FanDuel had engaged in false advertising and consumer fraud. FanDuel and DraftKings are in early-stage talks to merge, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. ",politicsNews,"June 18, 2016 "
House panel claims oversight of state climate probes into Exxon,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A Republican-led congressional committee sought on Friday to assert oversight over inquiries that about 20 states are making into Exxon Mobil and climate change, reiterating demands to know more about state attorneys general‚Äôs consultations with environmental groups. In a letter, some 17 members of Congress and ranking members of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee said they have broad jurisdiction that allows them to review investigations carried out by states. The committee was pushing back against state officials who have said they are not subject to federal oversight. The standoff is the latest in a high-stakes battle between the world‚Äôs largest publicly traded oil company and a coalition of state attorneys general who have said they would go after Exxon in a bid to force congressional action to tackle climate change. About 20 state officials jointly said in March they would participate in inquiries into whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of climate change. Prior to that March announcement, some state officials met with a range of prominent environmental and investment groups that oppose fossil fuels. The House committee has complained the inquiries risk stifling free speech and scientific inquiry, and that state officials were coordinating with special interest groups. The House committee demanded for the second time since May that state officials hand over all records of communications between their offices and outside groups. ‚ÄúCongress has a responsibility to investigate whether such investigations are having a chilling effect on the free flow of scientific inquiry and debate regarding climate change,‚Äù the letter said. ‚ÄúPeople should be troubled by any attempt by members of Congress to silence or undercut basic investigatory authority by a state attorney general‚Äôs office,‚Äù said Cyndi Roy Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. ‚ÄúOur office will not be intimidated by oil industry-backed members of the U.S. House of Representatives.‚Äù Exxon, for its part, has said it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years and communicated this to investors.   On Wednesday, Exxon asked a federal court to throw out a subpoena that would force it to hand over decades of documents on climate change to Healey‚Äôs office. ",politicsNews,"June 18, 2016 "
"George W. Bush ends exile, helps Republicans raise money","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President George W. Bush had every intention of sticking to his self-imposed exile from politics, but found that the phone kept ringing with appeals from Republican U.S. Senate candidates for help, friends say. As a result, Bush has embarked on a rescue mission to try to preserve the Republicans‚Äô narrow Senate majority in a year in which many party figures fear presumptive nominee Donald Trump will drag them down to defeat in the Nov. 8 elections. Republicans control 54 seats in the 100-member Senate. ‚ÄúI think that this is a one-off, temporary thing that where he can be helpful he will be,‚Äù said Dana Perino, who was Bush‚Äôs White House press secretary. Condoleezza Rice, who was Bush‚Äôs secretary of state and is now a political science professor at Stanford University, is also raising money for Republican candidates, but on Friday ruled out speculation that she might be drafted as Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate. ‚ÄúDr. Rice has¬†repeatedly said in past cycles as well as this one,¬†she‚Äôs not interested in being vice president.¬†She‚Äôs happy at Stanford and plans to stay,‚Äù said Rice chief of staff Georgia Godfrey. Friends say Bush was initially reluctant to get involved, feeling his time in the limelight had passed. They said he was surprised at the appeals he was receiving to get back into politics more than seven years after his eight-year White House run ended. So far Bush has headlined fund-raising events for Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. He plans to help senators Rob Portman of Ohio, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Roy Blunt of Missouri. Bush is no fan of Trump, but to a certain extent, he is doing Trump a favor in spite of the continuing antagonism toward the Bush family from the bellicose New York businessman. Typically, the party‚Äôs nominee is the chief fund-raiser in election years, but Trump‚Äôs fund-raising effort has lagged. Meanwhile, Trump continues to take swipes at the Bush family, particularly at Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who was defeated by Trump in the Republican presidential primary race. On Wednesday in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump complained about Jeb‚Äôs decision not to honor a pledge made last year to support the Republican presidential nominee whoever it is. ‚ÄúHe signed the pledge but he hasn‚Äôt endorsed me,‚Äù Trump said. Like his brother, Jeb Bush is helping raise money for Republican congressional candidates. ‚ÄúThe Bush family has a deep love for the party and cares about the future and in light of Trump‚Äôs capacity to damage the brand, I think this is part and parcel of doing what they can to preserve the party,‚Äù said Jeb Bush‚Äôs spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell.

Obama family explores 'Big Room' cavern on national parks tour,"CARLSBAD CAVERNS NATIONAL PARK, N.M. (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and his family escaped the blistering heat of the Chihuahuan Desert on Friday when they went through a maze of ancient caverns where the only sound was the drip-dripping from stalactites. The subterranean adventure was the first stop on a working vacation during which Obama will spend some time with his teenaged daughters while making the case for more spending on conservation and curbing climate change. It was just like any other family holiday, except the entourage of Secret Service agents, aides and press who follow Obama wherever he goes had to descend the 754 feet (230 m) on elevators in eight shifts. ‚ÄúHow cool is this?‚Äù he said to the press in the dark, damp alien landscape of the ‚ÄúBig Room,‚Äù the best known of the labyrinth of limestone caves that actor Will Rogers once called the ‚ÄúGrand Canyon with a roof on it.‚Äù  The president is helping celebrate the centennial of the National Park Service while highlighting his plan to reduce climate-changing carbon emissions, which he sees as part of the legacy of his time in office. The White House has said the changing climate evidenced by  droughts, increased flooding and wildfires and stronger storms has put national parks at risk. The Obamas were due to fly west later on Friday to the Sierra Nevada mountains and Yosemite, the country‚Äôs oldest national park and one of its most popular landmarks. Visits to national parks have surged due in part to lower gasoline prices. Still, roads, sewer systems and visitor centers in national parks are aging, and the government is grappling with a $11.5 billion backlog of maintenance projects. At Carlsbad, elevators broke down in 2015, though they seemed in good shape for the Obamas‚Äô descent. During his time in office, which will end on Jan. 20, 2017, Obama has added 20 sites to the national park system, protecting more than 265 million acres of public land and water and historic sites with new parks, monuments and restrictions for development, more than any other president. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said national park visits in 2016 were on pace to beat last year‚Äôs record of 307 million. Tourists contributed an estimated $300 billion to the economy, supporting about 2 million jobs, she told reporters. She wants Congress to remember those numbers as it considers investments in public lands. Republicans have slammed Obama for adding sites at a time when the government does not have enough funding to look after existing ones. ‚ÄúTo me, there is little point in conserving lands or allowing the federal government to acquire even more land if we are not going to take proper care of them,‚Äù Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska who is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said last year.

"Under pressure, senators formulate gun control compromise","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some Republican senators tried on Friday to craft a compromise bill to impose limited gun restrictions in the face of pressure from Democrats and public rage over the Orlando mass shooting, the deadliest in modern U.S. history. A gunman killed 49 people at the Orlando, Florida, gay nightclub last Sunday, sparking a scramble over competing gun measures in the U.S. Senate. While past gun-control measures have failed to clear Congress, the massacre, coupled with public pressure and a suggestion by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that he can work with gun rights lobbyists to bring about change, may be changing the picture. Republicans over the years have blocked gun control measures saying they step on Americans‚Äô right to bear arms as guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. During a week-long Senate debate, Democrats generally have criticized proposed Republican measures as being ineffective. Republicans and Democrats have offered four separate proposals to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales for people on terrorism ‚Äúwatch lists.‚Äù But they seem destined to fail because of partisan politics and a requirement that any proposal muster 60 of the 100 votes in the U.S. Senate. Republican Susan Collins of Maine, leading the new effort, is considering a more tailored approach. It would prevent the sale of guns to terrorism suspects whose names appear on either the government‚Äôs ‚Äúno-fly‚Äù list, which bans them from boarding planes, or a so-called ‚Äúselectee‚Äù list that requires additional screening at airports, her office said in an emailed statement. These lists are much shorter than a broad terrorism watch list kept by the FBI.  Collins‚Äô measure also includes a five-year ‚Äúlook-back‚Äù provision that would notify the government if someone who had been on the ‚Äúno-fly‚Äù or ‚Äúselectee‚Äù list in the last five years, but was dropped, purchases a gun. ‚ÄúThat would allow the FBI to put the individual under surveillance or take other appropriate action it deems necessary,‚Äù Collins‚Äô office said. The gun control issue is deeply divisive and there have been no major restrictions passed since 1994, when Congress imposed a ban on semi-automatic assault weapons. That expired after 10 years. About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014.     Vice President Joe Biden weighed in on the debate, urging a public groundswell in support of banning the type of weapons that have been used in mass shootings. ‚ÄúAssault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned from civilian ownership,‚Äù Biden said on Friday. Both the gunman in the Orlando attack, Omar Mateen, and the married couple who carried out a December mass shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, were thought to have been inspired by militant Islamist groups abroad. Collins‚Äô proposal likely would be offered in the Republican-led Senate sometime next week, provided the four other gun-control proposals fail to pass on Monday. Collins is working on the legislation with Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire; she has also been talking to Democrats. A senior Democratic aide said that Democrats have concerns that under Collins‚Äô bill, some people credibly suspected of involvement in terrorism would not be covered by the weapons ban. Collins told reporters on Thursday that barring everyone on terrorism watch lists from weapons purchases carried with it the risk of affecting people who have been swept onto the lists without good cause. U.S. authorities maintain several watch lists - the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains three and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence runs one database. People are placed on such lists based on the threat level they are believed to pose. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre trying to do is not deny constitutional rights to a large group of individuals‚Äù who find themselves on watch lists despite the fact that there might not be credible evidence of potential criminal intentions, Collins said. At least one Senate Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, has been involved in the talks, her spokeswoman said.  ‚ÄúI think she (Collins) is sincerely committed to finding a way to work this out,‚Äù said U.S. Senator Chris Murphy who, along with fellow Democrats, set the U.S. Capitol abuzz by talking on the Senate floor for nearly 15 straight hours this week to demand that Congress act on gun control. Murphy said it was too early to say whether any Democrats would get on board with her approach. On Friday, the largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group in the United States, the Human Rights Campaign, said it would push for curtailing access to assault-style rifles, expanding background checks for firearms buyers and limiting the ability of suspected terrorists to purchase guns.

"Obama, Saudi prince focus on Iraq and Syria in Washington meeting","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia on Friday discussed ways to support Iraqis in their fight against Islamic State militants and the importance of a political transition in war-torn Syria, the White House said. Obama met with Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval office for about an hour. The deputy crown prince is visiting the United States to repair frayed relations and to promote a plan, known as Vision 2030, to slash the kingdom‚Äôs dependence on oil exports. ‚ÄúThe President expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia‚Äôs contributions to the campaign against ISIL,‚Äù the White House said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.  The two talked about steps to support Iraqis ‚Äúincluding increased Gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs,‚Äù the White House said.  U.S. officials have expressed unease about the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which according to the United Nations and human rights groups has resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties. Saudi Arabia is worried about closer relations between the United States and Iran, Riyadh‚Äôs arch enemy, after a 2015 nuclear deal.   Obama welcomed Saudi Arabia‚Äôs commitment to a political settlement of the Yemen conflict and support by the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the kingdom is a member, to address humanitarian needs and rebuild the country, the White House said.  On Syria, Obama and the prince talked about the importance of supporting a political transition away from President Bashar al-Assad, the White House said. The United States is working with international partners on what it calls a Syrian-led transition process facilitated by the United Nations, but so far there has been little progress.  Over 50 diplomats at the U.S. State Department signed a memo, leaked on Thursday, that was critical of the Obama administration‚Äôs Syria policy and called for targeted military strikes against Assad‚Äôs government.  Asked about the memo, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, also in Washington, told reporters the kingdom had been arguing for a ‚Äúmore robust intervention‚Äù including airstrikes, a no-fly zone, and a no-drive zone, from the beginning of the five-year civil war.  Obama does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, White House spokeswoman Jen Friedman said.  Both Washington and Riyadh are anticipating the release of classified pages of a U.S. report into the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that some U.S. lawmakers have alleged link Saudi government officials to the attacks.

Bloomberg looks West after bankrolling Philadelphia soda tax win,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After successfully funding a campaign to pass a soda tax in Philadelphia, billionaire Michael Bloomberg is preparing to fund similar efforts in several other cities, giving new momentum to  measures seeking to limit soft drink consumption. The former New York City mayor contributed the bulk of the money for the pro-soda tax side in Philadelphia, providing around $1.6 million. Now the prominent public health crusader will support measures in San Francisco and Oakland, California this year, Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg, said in a conference call on Friday. Bloomberg may also support soda tax drives in Seattle and Multnomah County in Oregon, which includes Portland, in 2017, Wolfson said.  The billionaire‚Äôs planned backing raises the stakes for the powerful beverage industry, which has lobbied hard to defeat many of the 43 municipal and state-level attempts to implement a soda tax that have failed since 2008. Before this week, Berkeley, California was the only U.S. city with a soda tax.  But the success in Philadelphia, the country‚Äôs fifth-largest city with a diverse population of 1.6 million, could mark a turning point as Americans become more aware of health campaigners‚Äô message that sugary soft drinks contribute to obesity and diabetes.   ‚ÄúIf Berkeley was a tremor, Philadelphia is an earthquake, and we expect there will be more earthquakes going forward,‚Äù Wolfson said.  As New York‚Äôs mayor, Bloomberg led efforts to pass a state-level soda tax, prevent residents from buying sodas with food stamps, and limit the size of sugary beverages. His efforts prompted public outcry against what were dubbed ‚Äúnanny state‚Äù initiatives, and all three measures were ultimately defeated. Philadelphia‚Äôs Mayor Jim Kenney took a different approach, emphasizing the revenue benefits of the tax over the health angle. The city council approved the measure in a 13-4 vote on Thursday after activists raised a total of around $2 million, according to Kevin Feeley, who led the pro-tax campaign.  Feeley and Wolfson both said the soda industry outspent the pro-tax campaign.  A spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association (ABA), which represents Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo and funded a local group opposing the tax, said the group did not yet have a final tally for how much it spent. The spokeswoman added that the group would ‚Äúoppose all discriminatory tax proposals.‚Äù The group has said the tax‚Äôs passage in Philadelphia was the result of unique local political conditions and unlikely to have a ripple effect in other cities.   The ABA said on Thursday it would sue Philadelphia to stop the tax, and Wolfson did not rule out the possibility that Bloomberg would contribute to aid the city‚Äôs defense.  Wolfson declined to specify an amount that Bloomberg was willing to spend on the San Francisco and Oakland efforts, but noted that he was ‚Äúnot in a position to match soda dollar for dollar.‚Äù Bloomberg‚Äôs contributions are meant to help ‚Äúlevel the playing field,‚Äù he said.

Ryan says Republicans should follow 'conscience' on Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers should follow their conscience on whether to support Donald Trump in November‚Äôs presidential election, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said in an interview, reflecting the party‚Äôs unease over its White House candidate.  ‚ÄúThe last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that‚Äôs contrary to their conscience. Of course I wouldn‚Äôt do that,‚Äù the Republicans‚Äô most senior elected official said in excerpts released on Friday of an NBC interview set to air on Sunday.  Some Republican leaders and lawmakers in the House of Representatives are struggling to get behind the New York businessman, who last month became the party‚Äôs presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election. After an initial delay, Ryan has said he will back Trump but he has also acknowledged deep differences with him. He denounced as textbook racism Trump‚Äôs criticism of a Mexican-American judge and has also criticized Trump‚Äôs proposal - reiterated after the  massacre of 49 people in a gay bar in Orlando on Sunday - to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States. As Republicans seek to keep control of both chambers of Congress, Trump‚Äôs comments on such issues have also worried some lawmakers concerned about their own election prospects, particularly in close races. All 247 House Republican seats are up for grabs in the election. Trump, who has welcomed support from Ryan, this week fired back at Republican leaders, telling them to stop speaking out against him or else risk him potentially running ‚Äúby myself.‚Äù Ryan said earlier this week at his weekly press conference that he does not plan to withdraw his support of Trump, although they disagree on some key issues.  ‚ÄúI feel as a responsibility institutionally as the speaker of the House that I should not be leading some chasm in the middle of our party. Because you know what I know that‚Äôll do? That‚Äôll definitely knock us out of the White House,‚Äù Ryan said in the interview for NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù program. Trump‚Äôs embrace this week of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and potential gun control measures, in contrast to general Republican orthodoxy have also thrown conservative lawmakers.  Still, Republican leaders have to reconcile their unease with the fact that primary Republican voters opted for Trump. He has never held elected office before but won more than enough delegates to secure the party‚Äôs nomination at the Republican convention in July.  ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 "
Potential Boeing Iran sale faces opposition in U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior Republican House of Representatives lawmakers said on Friday they were concerned that Boeing Co‚Äôs reported plans to sell aircraft to Iran could threaten U.S. national security and had requested more information from the company. ‚ÄúAmerican companies should not be complicit in weaponizing the Iranian Regime,‚Äù Representatives Jeb Hensarling and Peter Roskam said in a letter to Boeing released on Friday. Iran said on Tuesday it had reached an agreement with Boeing for the supply of jetliners, reopening the country‚Äôs skies to new U.S. aircraft for the first time in decades under an international nuclear agreement that eased sanctions. Boeing has not confirmed an aircraft sale agreement. The company on Tuesday declined to provide detailed comment in response to Western and Middle East sources saying Iran had reached an understanding with the company to acquire over 100 passenger jets. The nuclear pact reached by Democratic President Barack Obama was opposed by every Republican member of the U.S. Congress. Several questioned the Boeing deal as soon as the news reports came out. In their letter to Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, the lawmakers asked for ‚Äúclarification‚Äù of the current state of negotiations. Their questions included whether Boeing could guarantee that Iran‚Äôs government could not convert Boeing passenger aircraft to cargo aircraft and whether it would repossess aircraft if Iran violated the nuclear agreement. Hensarling is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and Roskam is chairman of the Oversight subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee. Not every congressional Republican is opposed to a potential U.S. aircraft deal. Senator Mark Kirk, who represents Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, said in a hallway interview at the Senate he had mixed feelings about it. ‚ÄúYou want the jobs, but you are worried about what the Iranians are going to do with the aircraft,‚Äù Kirk said this week.

Florida lawmaker drops Senate bid to make way for Rubio,"(Reuters) - U.S. Representative David Jolly ended his bid for a U.S. Senate seat from Florida on Friday, opening the way for Marco Rubio to seek re-election in an effort to help Republicans maintain control of the chamber. ‚ÄúMarco is saying he‚Äôs getting in,‚Äù Jolly, a fellow Republican who has been running to fill the seat for the past 10 months, said on CNN. Rubio dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination.  Later Friday, Jolly, who represents the area around St. Petersburg and Clearwater, said he will run for re-election to his congressional seat. ‚ÄúToday I am asking my friends and neighbors to let me continue doing my job as a member of Congress,‚Äù Jolly said in a news conference in Clearwater. He will likely face former Governor Charlie Crist, a Democrat, in the Nov. 8 election.  Rubio, who ended his presidential bid in March, said this week he was reconsidering running and may decide as early as this weekend.  Representatives for Rubio declined to answer questions about his future plans. At the news conference, Jolly said he fully expects Rubio to run for re-election to the Senate. His spokesman Preston Rudie told Reuters the congressman ‚Äúhad no actual knowledge of a Rubio decision.‚Äù Rubio‚Äôs entry into the senate race would complicate Democrats‚Äô efforts to win back a majority in the Senate in the November election. Republicans won control of the Senate in the 2014 mid-term election and now hold 54 seats in the 100-seat chamber. Democrats have 44 seats and two independents are aligned with them.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans have urged Rubio to run despite a pledge during his presidential campaign not to seek re-election. They cited polls showing he is the only Republican who can win the state. The deadline is June 24 for candidates to file with Florida election officials their intention to run for the Senate.

"Sanders vows to help Clinton beat Trump, but keeps campaign alive","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders promised on Thursday to work with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election, but did not formally pull out of the race for the White House. Sanders did not endorse Clinton during an online speech to his supporters, but made it clear he was shifting his focus to building a grassroots movement to fight for his liberal policy agenda and transform the Democratic Party. ‚ÄúThe major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly, and I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time,‚Äù the U.S. senator from Vermont said. ‚ÄúI also look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to transform the Democratic Party so that it becomes a party of working people and young people, and not just wealthy campaign contributors,‚Äù he said in a speech broadcast from his hometown of Burlington, Vermont. Sanders, who has resisted pressure from Democrats to exit the White House race and back Clinton since she clinched the party nomination last week, said he would keep fighting for his goals of reducing income inequality, removing big money from politics and reining in Wall Street. ‚ÄúDefeating Donald Trump cannot be our only goal. We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1,900 delegates.‚Äù Sanders has kept his campaign alive as leverage to force concessions from Clinton on his policy goals during deliberations on the party‚Äôs issues platform, and on the reforms he seeks in the Democratic Party‚Äôs nominating process. But he has laid off some staff, stopped campaigning and dropped plans to court unbound delegates in an unspoken acknowledgment the former secretary of state will be the nominee. Sanders, who met with Clinton on Tuesday night after the nominating process ended, said he would continue his discussions with her campaign to make certain ‚Äúthe Democratic Party passes the most progressive platform in its history, and that Democrats actually fight for that agenda.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur vision for the future of this country is not some kind of fringe idea. It is not a radical idea. It is mainstream. It is what millions of Americans believe in and want to see happen,‚Äù Sanders said. ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 "
Senate inches toward possible gun control action,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A long-running battle over gun control in the United States reaches a critical stage next week in the U.S. Senate amid signs Americans are more willing to accept limited restrictions after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. While it is far from likely new measures will pass, the Orlando, Florida, gay nightclub massacre of 49 people and a suggestion by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that something be done have fostered a different atmosphere. While President Barack Obama was in Orlando consoling the survivors of the rampage by a gunman who claimed allegiance to Islamic State militants, the U.S. Senate moved closer to votes on limited gun control measures. About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014. As always, Democrats were challenging Republicans to vote for new restrictions and reject pressure from the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby that has been known to punish politicians who thwart its will. U.S. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and fellow Democrats set the U.S. Capitol abuzz by talking on the Senate floor for nearly 15 straight hours to demand that Congress act on gun control. They ended their speeches before dawn, citing a Republican pledge to hold votes soon on measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and to prevent people on U.S. terrorism watch lists from buying guns. The Senate is expected to vote on Monday on four proposals. One from Democrat Dianne Feinstein would let the government prevent terrorist suspects from buying guns. A second from Republican John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, would require court approval within three days for a government ban on an individual‚Äôs attempt to buy a gun. Democrats have said Cornyn‚Äôs plan is unworkable; Republicans say Feinstein‚Äôs might harm the rights of people wrongly on terror suspect lists. A third proposal, from Democrat Murphy, would expand background check procedures to the sales of all firearms, including those online and at gun shows. A fourth proposal, from Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, would provide for law enforcement to be notified if a person investigated for terrorism in the last five years tries to buy a gun.  Gun control is a potent issue in U.S. politics. Republicans, who control the Senate, have blocked Democratic-backed gun control measures over the years, saying they infringe on the right to bear arms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Any bill would have to pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the president to become law. At his weekly news conference on Thursday, Paul Ryan, speaker of the House of Representatives, injected a note of caution. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt take away a citizen‚Äôs rights without due process,‚Äù said Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican. ‚ÄúIf you have a quick idea in the heat of the moment that says let‚Äôs take away a person‚Äôs rights without due process, we‚Äôre going to defend the Constitution.‚Äù A string of mass shootings across the United States in schoolhouses, churches, movie theaters and other public places has failed to break the deadlock. The last major gun control measure was a ban in 1994 on semi-automatic assault weapons such as the one used in Orlando on Sunday. The ban expired 10 years later. One of the most dramatic moments in the Senate debate came when Republican Senator John McCain, who is in a tough re-election race in Arizona, told reporters Obama is ‚Äúdirectly responsible‚Äù for Islamic State-inspired attacks on Americans like the one in Orlando. He later said he meant to say he blamed Obama‚Äôs decision to withdraw most U.S. forces from Iraq, and that this had fueled the rise of Islamic State. Murphy, asked what would be the message if the Senate fails to act on the gun control measures next week, suggested it could be a campaign issue for the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúThere are going to be a lot of voters in this country who are going to watch ... the votes that are cast next week,‚Äù he said. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president has been endorsed by the NRA. He jumped into the gun debate by saying he would meet with NRA leaders to talk about barring people who are on terrorism watch lists from buying guns. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be looking at it very, very seriously - the terror watch list and the no-fly list, I‚Äôm going to be talking to the NRA about that and starting a real dialogue. I think a lot of people agree with me but I want to really hear what they have to say,‚Äù Trump told Fox News on Wednesday night. Democrats were deeply skeptical that Trump‚Äôs word signaled any sort of shift toward more Republican support for Democratic-backed gun control proposals. ‚ÄúHe is going to meet with the NRA. ... What‚Äôs he going to come out saying? ‚ÄòOh the NRA and I agreed we shouldn‚Äôt have terrorists have guns,‚Äô but doing nothing about it,‚Äù U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters.

"Trumped by candidate's rhetoric, Republican lawmakers at a loss for words","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The awkward efforts of Republicans to embrace their party‚Äôs standard-bearer Donald Trump looked particularly painful in Congress this week as lawmakers ducked into elevators, dashed away from reporters, ignored questions or, worse, tried to answer them.  Only days after a furor over his criticism of a Mexican-American judge, the presumptive presidential nominee sent Republicans reeling again by renewing his call for a ban on Muslim immigration after a gunman who pledged allegiance to Islamic militants killed of 49 people at a Florida nightclub. Then former reality TV star Trump waded into two sensitive topics for social conservatives by embracing the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and suggesting the country may need certain new gun control measures.   For lawmakers accustomed to well-crafted talking points and predictable lines of questioning, the week marked a chaotic flurry of contorted responses or terse, tight-lipped replies. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming walked away when asked about Trump‚Äôs embrace of the LGBT community, saying: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the latest is. I haven‚Äôt read anything. I haven‚Äôt been watching.‚Äù Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a former Trump adversary in the presidential primaries, had to bat away two Trump questions before he could announce that he is considering running for re-election ‚Äì a decision that could determine whether Republicans retain control of the Senate in the Nov. 8 election. Senator Ted Cruz, another rival in the primaries, refused to respond directly to the speech in which Trump hardened his line on Muslims while Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr called it ‚Äúan OK speech‚Äù before stepping into an elevator and refusing to respond to any more questions.   The Trump challenge is obvious even for seasoned Republicans.        ¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm spending my days commenting on everything that Donald Trump says,‚Äù lamented John McCain, chairman of Senate Armed Services Committee. Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, ricocheted from rejection of Trump‚Äôs comments on Muslims to doubts about the legality of his proposed immigration ban to bafflement over the billionaire‚Äôs response to the Orlando shootings.  Trump controversies have also overshadowed House Speaker Paul Ryan‚Äôs rollout of a policy agenda, a campaign document that was supposed to help bring Trump‚Äôs position more into line with mainline party doctrine.  Asked on Thursday whether he was bothered by having to contend with Trump‚Äôs remarks, Ryan called Trump ‚Äúa different kind of candidate...(in) a different kind of year.‚Äù  Asked how many more times he would be called on to do so, Ryan said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the answer to that question either.‚Äù In an ironic message to his critics among the Republican leadership this week, Trump had this to say: ‚ÄúBe quiet, just please be quiet. Don‚Äôt talk. Please be quiet. Just be quiet.‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs response? ‚Äú...You can‚Äôt make this up sometimes,‚Äù he said.   A political neophyte who has never held elected office, Trump has also said he may not need much from his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill anyway. ‚ÄúWe have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself.

McCain says he 'misspoke' in blaming Obama for attacks on Americans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said on Thursday that President Barack Obama was ‚Äúdirectly responsible‚Äù for attacks on Americans like the one in Florida because of policies that contributed to the rise of the Islamic State. But the Arizona Republican later  said he misspoke. McCain, who is in a tough re-election race, made the comments after reporters chased him down a marble stairway and into a hallway of the U.S. Capitol. They asked what he was hearing from constituents about gun control issues being debated in the Senate after Sunday‚Äôs shooting rampage by a gunman who claimed allegiance to Islamic State militants. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hearing a lot from my constituents about what happened and of course I am making them realize that Barack Obama is directly responsible for it,‚Äù McCain said. ‚ÄúBecause when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama‚Äôs failures, utter failures,‚Äù McCain said. ‚ÄúSo the responsibility for it lies with President Barack Obama and his failed policies.‚Äù After media reports began to appear about his comments, McCain, who lost the White House to Obama in the 2008 presidential election, posted a clarification on Twitter and then issued a statement that said he meant to blame Obama‚Äôs policies, not the president personally. ‚ÄúI misspoke. I did not mean to imply that the president was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama‚Äôs national security decisions, not the president himself,‚Äù McCain said in the statement. Forty-nine people died in the shooting in Orlando, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The gunman was U.S.-born Omar Mateen, 29, whose parents immigrated from Afghanistan. McCain, 79, faces multiple opponents in a Republican primary race in August, and some analysts say he is in danger of losing the Senate seat he has held for three decades. Earlier this week, presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appeared to suggest Obama may have been complicit in the Orlando attacks. ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôre led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he‚Äôs got something else in mind,‚Äù Trump told Fox News. ‚ÄúAnd the something else in mind ‚Äî you know, people can‚Äôt believe it ...

White House sees surge in Syrian refugee admissions this year,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration believes it will be able to process many more Syrian refugees in the last half of fiscal 2016 than in the first six months, allowing it to meet its goal of admitting at least 10,000 by Sept. 30. In a letter to Democratic Senator Richard Durbin seen by Reuters on Thursday, the White House said it has allocated additional staff and added more processing locations in the Middle East to expedite the screening process without compromising U.S. security. ‚ÄúTherefore, we expect to admit more Syrians in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2016 than we did in the first and second quarters to meet our goal of admitting at least 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year,‚Äù the letter said. The administration‚Äôs move is in sharp contrast to recent anti-refugee rhetoric by many Republicans, especially since the killings in Orlando on Sunday raised fears of attacks. Donald Trump, the presumptive 2016 Republican presidential nominee, has called for the refugee resettlement program to be suspended, saying ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know who they are. They have no documentation, and we don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre planning.‚Äù Backers of the administration‚Äôs plan dispute such statements, citing the extensive screening process the Syrian refugees undergo. So far, the United States has offered refuge to far fewer of the millions fleeing the war in Syria than many of its closest allies. Germany has taken in hundreds of thousands and Canada admitted nearly 30,000 between November 2015 and May 1, 2016. The letter said the administration had set up a temporary processing center in Jordan and expanded operations in Turkey. It also has restarted interviews in neighboring Lebanon, and begun limited processing in Erbil, Iraq. Durbin was a lead author of a letter to President Barack Obama in May, which was signed by more than half the Democrats in the Senate and urged the president to move more quickly to admit Syrians. By mid-May, only 1,736 Syrians had been allowed into the country, a pace that would have fallen far short of the 10,000 goal for the full year. The letter seen on Thursday was the administration‚Äôs response to the one sent in May. Obama‚Äôs plan to admit 10,000 Syrians was met with a firestorm of criticism in the United States, mostly from Republicans who say that violent militants could enter the country by posing as refugees. More than 30 governors, most of them Republicans, have tried to keep refugees out of their states. ",politicsNews,"June 16, 2016 "
Illinois budget impasse hits $550 million bond sale,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois‚Äô long-running budget impasse stung the state on Thursday in the U.S. municipal market where buyers of its $550 million bond issue demanded bigger yields over the market benchmark. The pricing was ‚Äúsurprisingly soft,‚Äù considering a strong rally in muni bonds on Thursday, said Greg Saulnier, a Municipal Market Data analyst. The results demonstrate that the market is increasing its penalty due to the state‚Äôs worsening fiscal and political problems, leaving Illinois unable to take full advantage of the historically low borrowing rates. Bank of America Merrill Lynch won the tax-exempt general obligation deal in competitive bidding, pricing bonds due in 2026 with a 5 percent coupon to yield 3.32 percent, which is 185 basis points over MMD‚Äôs triple-A yield scale. The spread was 175 basis points ahead of the bond sale, according to MMD, a unit of Thomson Reuters.  It was also wider than the 154 basis-point spread in 10 years for Illinois‚Äô $480 million GO bond sale in January. Illinois is poised to be the only U.S. state since at least the 1930s to end a fiscal year without a complete budget. Its Republican governor and Democratic-controlled legislature have so far failed to reach a deal on fiscal 2016 or 2017 spending plans. That leaves unaddressed the growing structural budget deficit and huge $111 billion unfunded pension liability in the fifth-biggest U.S. state. The bond issue itself was seen as a weapon in the political war to pressure Democrats to cave in to Governor Bruce Rauner‚Äôs demands, while losing money for the cash-strapped state. Muni yields have been hitting new record lows on MMD‚Äôs scale in recent days, driven by cash-heavy investors chasing low supply of debt. Rauner‚Äôs office said the true interest cost for the bonds, which carry maturities from 2017 to 2041, was 3.74 percent, down from 3.99 percent in the January sale, and the lowest ever for similar general obligation bonds issued by the state. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear from today‚Äôs bond sale that investors realize Illinois now has a governor that is trying to turn the state around and right its fiscal ship,‚Äù Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said in a statement. Some market participants thought Illinois‚Äô so-called credit spread should be even wider. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs odd to me,‚Äù said Nicholos Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. ‚ÄúIllinois has proven time and time again they can‚Äôt get anything done.‚Äù    Heading into the deal, Illinois‚Äô credit ratings, which were already the lowest among the states, were downgraded by Moody‚Äôs Investor Service and Standard & Poor‚Äôs.  The governor‚Äôs office also revealed on Wednesday that the state lacks appropriations to actually spend all the proceeds earmarked mainly for road construction and mass transit projects due to the impasse. State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a first-term Democrat, predicted the bond issue could be a net money-loser for Illinois if the borrowed funds go unspent and must be invested short-term. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make far less in interest than we‚Äôll be paying in interest to the bondholders,‚Äù Frerichs said in an interview. ‚ÄúI think we need to make these investments in infrastructure, but we‚Äôre going about it in the wrong order. It seems backwards issuing the bonds and hoping they get an appropriation to spend them.‚Äù On Wednesday, Rauner administration officials warned of the imminent shutdown of transportation projects and the loss of 25,000 construction jobs without a budget deal. Spokesmen for House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton, both Democrats, declined to speculate on the chances of either legislative chamber granting the Rauner administration the spending authority it needs to fully tap the bond issue.

Philadelphia passes soda tax after mayor rewrites playbook,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney scored a victory that had eluded more than 40 U.S. public officials who took on the powerful U.S. soda industry when the city council voted on Thursday to slap a tax on sweetened drinks.  After a bitter, months-long battle, the city council voted 13-4 to approve a 1.5 cent-per-ounce tax on sugary and diet drinks beginning in January. The council already approved the plan in a preliminary vote last week, and the outcome had not been expected to change.  The City of Brotherly Love became the biggest U.S. city to have such a tax. Much smaller Berkeley, California, was the first. Similar efforts, including several spearheaded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, were defeated after intense lobbying from organizations like the American Beverage Association, which opposes the Philadelphia move and represents Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc.  Following Thursday‚Äôs vote, the ABA said it would take legal action to stop the tax.  The Philadelphia vote marked a major victory for health advocates who say sugary drinks cause obesity and diabetes. But experts noted those concerns were not the focus for Kenney and other backers of the tax as they took on critics complaining that ‚Äúnanny state‚Äù public health measures intrude on residents‚Äô personal lives. Instead, Kenney rewrote the soda-tax advocate‚Äôs playbook. He played up the benefits of the cash injection from the tax for the city‚Äôs depleted coffers. In the first year, the tax is projected to raise $91 million, and he pledged to spend funds on public programs such as universal pre-kindergarten. ‚ÄúIf you want to tax something and people know where the money‚Äôs going to go, then it‚Äôs easier for them to get behind it,‚Äù Kenney said in an interview. He noted that focusing on revenue, rather than health, was largely responsible for the measure‚Äôs passage.  The strategic shift could lend momentum to movements in San Francisco, neighboring Oakland, California, and Boulder, Colorado. Residents of those cities will vote in November on similar taxes, which could deal further blows to a U.S. soft drink industry already hit by declining soda consumption. U.S. soda consumption fell for the 11th straight year in 2015, according to Euromonitor data.  Bloomberg made public health a centerpiece of his tenure as New York City mayor between 2002 and 2013. He moved to limit smoking in parks and restaurants, ban transfats and require calorie counts posted in some restaurants. On soda, he pushed for a tax, then a ban on soda purchases with food stamps, and finally a much-lampooned limit on the size of sugary drinks. His efforts were ultimately rejected, with critics decrying the moves toward a ‚Äúnanny state.‚Äù  The strategy worked in Britain, where a new soft drinks levy was announced in March after officials emphasized the country‚Äôs obesity crisis, saying it cost the economy billions of pounds annually and was a huge burden on the state-funded health system.  That approach never worked in Philadelphia. Michael Nutter, the previous mayor, twice tried to pass a soda tax as a health initiative and as a way to plug a budget shortfall. He was unable to push it through the city council. ‚ÄúTwice before it was used in Philadelphia and it was not successful. It was used in New York and it was not effective,‚Äù said Kenney, adding that while the health benefits of a tax are not ‚Äúless important,‚Äù they are less tangible.  Kenney, who became mayor in January, had made a campaign pledge to provide universal pre-kindergarten, and he kept that issue as his focus. A spokeswoman said complex state laws on taxation made enacting a citywide soda tax the best option to raise revenue for that signature proposal. Bloomberg personally contributed funding to support Philadelphia‚Äôs pro-tax campaigners.  Opponents of Philadelphia‚Äôs soda tax argued that the measure will disproportionately hurt the poor and prompt Philadelphians to travel to nearby suburbs to buy soda.  A spokesman for No Philly Grocery Tax, a local ABA-funded group, said it would sue the city to stop it from imposing the ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù tax, but was still analyzing all its legal options. In a statement, it called the tax ‚Äúregressive and discriminatory.‚Äù  Kenney said the city was prepared to defend the tax in any litigation from the beverage industry.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the precedent that they were so staunchly fighting, and that‚Äôs their problem now,‚Äù Kenney said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see the beginnings of a kind of domino effect relative to this specific effort.‚Äù  In Colorado, Boulder hopes to use soda tax revenue on health programs, and San Francisco and Oakland officials would recommend but not require funds raised to go toward obesity and diabetes prevention.  When Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014, industry groups dismissed the measure as a fluke given the city‚Äôs largely white population and reputation as a hotbed for liberal measures. But Philadelphia is the fifth-largest U.S. city, with 1.6 million people. ‚ÄúNo one can trivialize it as they can trivialize Berkeley,‚Äù said Larry Tramutola, a California political strategist who worked on the Berkeley campaign and is currently leading the San Francisco and Oakland efforts.

Clinton outpaces rivals in drug company donations,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has taken more money from employees of America‚Äôs 15 biggest pharmaceuticals companies than all of the Republicans who attempted a run for the White House this year combined, according to campaign finance disclosures. The donations, which were nearly double those accepted by Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, came even as the former senator and secretary of state vowed to curb price gouging in the industry if elected. Clinton‚Äôs campaign took nearly $240,000 from employees of the industry between its launch and the end of April, compared with just under $168,000 for all of the Republicans together, including around $1,700 for presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to the filings.  The money, a drop in the bucket of Clinton‚Äôs nearly $190 million in overall individual contributions, has tended to come from people in top jobs: 54 percent of the donors list their position as executive, director, manager or lawyer. Donors and company officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment on the contributions. Industry insiders say the sector may be drawn to Clinton for a few reasons: She has a good chance of winning against Trump in November, her policies are relatively transparent and predictable, and she‚Äôs more supportive of international trade than rivals. Many of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies are also headquartered in areas of the country that are more heavily populated by liberals, like New Jersey and New York ‚Äì another potential reason for the Clinton-heavy employee donations. ‚Äú(Trade) is, in particular, an issue for the pharmaceutical industry.

He added: ‚ÄúWe have very limited ability to predict what would happen in a Trump administration. We don‚Äôt know the people, we don‚Äôt have a lot to go on.‚Äù Trump, who largely self-funded his primary bid, only recently began soliciting donations for the general election, meaning his contributions from supporters in all industries are likely to rise in the coming months. Clinton tapped into widespread public frustration over soaring health costs this winter when she outlined a plan to curb drug price hikes and singled out pharmaceuticals company Valeant, saying she would ‚Äúgo after them‚Äù if elected. Trump‚Äôs campaign seized on Clinton‚Äôs donations from the industry as proof that she would be unlikely to follow through.  ‚ÄúHillary Clinton will be totally controlled by the special interests,‚Äù Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. Clinton has rejected the idea. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton has spent her career fighting to crack down on rising prescription drug prices and hold drug companies accountable,‚Äù spokesman Josh Schwerin said.¬† Clinton‚Äôs donations from drug companies have grown since the last time she ran, in 2008, but fall far short of her rival in that race, President Barack Obama, who took in more than $500,000 in contributions from employees of pharmaceutical companies during the equivalent period of time. Clinton‚Äôs total in this race so far, however, beats the combined take in the 2012 election of Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney from employees of the industry of $170,000, according to the filings.

U.S. top court puts some limits on contractor fraud lawsuits,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday imposed some limits on the kind of fraud claims that can be brought against federal contractors in a case involving a suit against one of America‚Äôs largest hospital operators over a woman‚Äôs death at one of its facilities. But the 8-0 ruling was not the broad victory for business sought by the company, Universal Health Services, and other healthcare providers fearful of suits under the U.S. False Claims Act, which lets individuals make claims that the federal government has been defrauded. The justices threw out a 2015 appeals court ruling that had allowed the parents of Yarushka Rivera to sue Universal Health Services under the False Claims Act, but sent the case back to a lower court, meaning the suit could potentially still proceed. Rivera suffered a fatal seizure in 2009 at age 19 a mental health facility owned by the company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The lawsuit said the facility provided ‚Äúgravely inadequate treatment‚Äù and used ‚Äúunsupervised and unqualified personnel.‚Äù The ruling represented a partial victory for the business community because it rejected the lower court‚Äôs expansive view of a company‚Äôs liability under the False Claims Act.  Roy Englert, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services‚Äô lawyer, said he was pleased the justices threw out the appeals court ruling and set a ‚Äúnew rigorous standard‚Äù for determining if the claims can move forward. Rivera‚Äôs parents, Julio Escobar and Carmen Correa, accused the company of defrauding the government because it was getting federal Medicaid funding to provide treatment to low-income people and did not comply with personnel regulations at the Lawrence facility. The ruling ‚Äúaccepts the basic notion that fraudsters can‚Äôt provide shoddy services to the government and expect payment without incurring significant liability,‚Äù said David Frederick, the lawyer for Rivera‚Äôs family. Businesses had hoped the justices would put more limits, or disallow completely, lawsuits based on a federal contractor‚Äôs failure to meet certain legal or regulatory requirements not specifically outlined in a government contract.  The court instead said such lawsuits can be filed as long as they are relevant to the government‚Äôs decision to make the payment to the company. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the parents ‚Äúmay well have adequately pleaded a violation‚Äù of the fraud law, but added that the False Claims Act ‚Äúis not a means of imposing treble damages and other penalties for insignificant regulatory or contractual violations.‚Äù The Obama administration had backed the parents.

"Clinton considering Warren, not Sanders, for running mate: WSJ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton is considering U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren for her running mate for the Democratic presidential ticket, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing several people familiar with the process. Warren, a leading progressive voice among Democrats, is among those Democratic presidential candidate Clinton is vetting for the vice presidential position, the newspaper reported. Clinton‚Äôs rival Bernie Sanders is not, it added.  Sources told Reuters earlier this month that Warren, who represents Massachusetts, is considering the potential role.  Representatives for Clinton, Sanders and Warren did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the report. Clinton is the Democratic Party‚Äôs presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, having won the last primary contest this week in the District of Columbia.  Although Clinton and Sanders met this week, the senator from Vermont does not plan to end his campaign or endorse Clinton in a video speech to supporters scheduled for later on Thursday, his spokesman said.     While the search for a potential partner in the race is still in its early stages, the Journal reported several Democrats said Clinton‚Äôs campaign is looking at a number of potential candidates, including Warren. Other prospective running mates include U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez and U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli√°n Castro, according to the report. Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Cory Booker of New Jersey as well as U.S. Representatives Xavier Becerra of California and Tim Ryan of Ohio are also under consideration, it said.  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is also a potential candidate, it added.  Warren threw her support behind Clinton last week as the former secretary of state moved her sights from the nominating contest toward a Nov. 8 match-up against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Warren could help Clinton win over Sanders supporters from the party‚Äôs more liberal wing after a surprisingly protracted primary race. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, has not yet dropped out.  She also would give Clinton a vocal boost in her fight against Trump. Warren has called Trump a threat to the country and has vowed to keep lashing out at him. (This story has been refiled to remove superfluous word ‚Äúendorsed‚Äù in paragraph nine.)

"Labor powerhouse AFL-CIO backs Clinton, vows 'targeted campaign'","(Reuters) - The largest labor federation in the United States, the AFL-CIO, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on Thursday, vowing to throw the full weight of more than 50 unions representing 12.5 million members behind the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.      ‚ÄúHillary Clinton is a proven leader who shares our values,‚Äù AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe will run a sophisticated, targeted ground campaign. And with the dire consequences Donald Trump poses for America‚Äôs working families, it has to be.‚Äù  While the federation generally does not endorse a Democratic candidate until there is an official nominee, Trumka has warned for months that he believes Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump would be disastrous for working people if elected.  After the endorsement, Clinton pledged to spend more on public infrastructure and to fight to improve schools. She vowed to increase the federal minimum wage, offer paid family leave and ensure that women receive equal pay. ‚ÄúAs president, I will stand proudly with the AFL-CIO and fight to protect the rights and values that helped build the mighty American middle class. Workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House,‚Äù Clinton said in a statement. The AFL-CIO has already run digital ads criticizing Trump‚Äôs candidacy and will now work to boost Clinton‚Äôs campaign on the ground. Working America, one AFL-CIO affiliate that deals with nonunion workers, already has teams in crucial so-called battleground states. In response to the federation‚Äôs endorsement of Clinton, Trump‚Äôs campaign said the AFL-CIO no longer represents the interests of American workers. ‚ÄúI will fight harder for American workers than anyone ever has,‚Äù Trump said in a statement.

'Lone hacker' claims responsibility for cyber attack on Democrats,"(Reuters) - A ‚Äúlone hacker‚Äù has taken responsibility for a cyber attack on the U.S. Democratic National Committee, which the DNC and a cyber-security firm have blamed on the Russian government. The DNC and cyber firm CrowdStrike disclosed the attack on Tuesday, saying that hackers working for Russia broke into the DNC‚Äôs computer network, spied on internal communications and stole research on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. A Russian government spokesman responded by saying that Moscow had not been involved. On Wednesday, an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 took responsibility for the attack in a post on the blogging site WordPress.com, saying the DNC was ‚Äúhacked by a lone hacker.‚Äù The DNC did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday evening on Guccifer 2.0‚Äôs claim. CrowdStrike said it stands by findings that the Russian government was behind the attacks.

"Illinois to sell bonds, but cannot tap all the proceeds","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois will sell $550 million of bonds on Thursday but lacks authority from the state legislature to spend all of the proceeds due to an ongoing budget impasse. ‚ÄúThe General Assembly needs to grant appropriation authority to fully expend the proceeds from the bond sale, although existing FY16 appropriations could be used to expend a portion of them,‚Äù Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Governor Bruce Rauner, said on Wednesday. Her statement followed a news conference earlier on Wednesday with the Republican governor and his transportation department head, who warned of the imminent shutdown of hundreds of construction projects if the Democrat-controlled legislature does not approve Rauner‚Äôs temporary budget plan. All but $20 million of the state‚Äôs general obligation bond issue is earmarked for mass transit and road construction projects. The odd timing of the announcement on the eve of the state bond sale handed Rauner‚Äôs Democratic rivals in the state legislature fodder to question the first-term governor‚Äôs actions.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping none of his activities or staff work is going to drive up borrowing costs like it did for the Chicago Public Schools in February,‚Äù said Steve Brown, spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. The school district delayed, then downsized its bond sale,  after Rauner threatened a state takeover of CPS and said the system was headed for bankruptcy, comments Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called ‚Äúshameful‚Äù because of their possible impact on the bond sale. Rauner on Wednesday pleaded with Democratic lawmakers to return to session to pass a spending plan that would keep the state operating until January and fully fund K-12 schools. ‚ÄúAllowing the crisis to continue is wrong,‚Äù Rauner said, referring to the ongoing impasse that has left Illinois as the only state without a fiscal 2016 budget. Illinois has been dependent on court orders and a muddle of ongoing and stopgap appropriations to continue operating and lawmakers have not reached any agreement on a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The state‚Äôs GO bonds trade at wide spreads over Municipal Market Data‚Äôs benchmark triple-A yield scale. But Illinois‚Äô upcoming debt issue will likely benefit from yields in the municipal market that are at or near record lows as cash-heavy investors chase scarce supply of bonds issued by states, cities, schools and other issuers.

Factbox: Eyes on U.S. terrorism watchlists after Orlando shootings,"(Reuters) - As facts emerge about Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday, questions have arisen about how well-known he was to U.S. intelligence agencies. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Monday that Mateen was on a watchlist between May 2013 and March 2014 while he was under investigation after claiming a connection to or support for multiple Islamist extremist groups, including al Qaeda, Hezbollah, al-Nusra and Islamic State. The FBI maintains three watchlists and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence runs one database. People are placed on a watchlist according to the threat level they are believed to pose. Comey did not specify which watchlist named Mateen.  Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton has supported stricter gun laws and said on Monday she would push for laws that would prevent people on a no-fly list from buying guns. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has embraced gun rights, said he would meet with the leading U.S. gun rights group about preventing people on a government watchlist from buying guns. The U.S. government maintains the following databases: Terrorist Watchlist or Terrorist Screening Database (about 420,000 names): Established after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Terrorist Watchlist is intended ‚Äúto positively identify known or suspected terrorists trying to obtain visas, enter the U.S, board aircraft, or engage in other activity.‚Äù Prior to 2001, intelligence agencies maintained dozens of individual lists. The Terrorist Watchlist is run by the FBI‚Äôs Terrorist Screening Center with the goal of consolidating the U.S. government‚Äôs watchlists into a single database.   No-Fly List (about 16,000 names): A subset of the Terrorist Screening Database, the No-Fly List prohibits people known or suspected of terrorism from boarding a plane that departs from or arrives in the United States. ¬† Selectee List (about 16,000 names): A subset of the Terrorist Watchlist, the Selectee List includes individuals who are permitted to fly, but receive more intensive screening. In addition to the thousands of records updated daily from federal, state and local law enforcement, the Selectee List provides an additional level of screening for individuals thought to present a greater threat.  Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database (about 1.1 million names): Run by the National Counterterrorism Center, part of the Office of the National Director of Intelligence, the TIDE Database shares information with the FBI‚Äôs watchlists. As of December 2013, it contained about 1.1 million people, about 25,000 of them U.S. citizens. Unlike the FBI‚Äôs database, TIDE is viewable only by counterterrorism professionals in the U.S. intelligence community and is not shared with local law enforcement.  Federal agencies propose people for inclusion on the TIDE database based on an evaluation of the threat they pose. Reasons someone may be added to the TIDE database include committing terrorist activity, preparing or planning a terrorist activity or providing support, such as funds or housing, for a terrorist organization.

California legislature sends $122.5 billion budget to governor,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The California legislature agreed on Wednesday to a $122.5 billion spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 and sent it to Governor Jerry Brown, who is expected to sign it.  The budget directs $2 billion to the state‚Äôs rainy day fund, a priority for Brown, a Democrat and fiscal moderate who has warned that an economic downturn could lie ahead for the nation‚Äôs most populous state.  Lower-than-expected income tax revenues in April caught state officials by surprise, and Brown said the state could take in $1.9 billion less than anticipated in taxes over the coming fiscal year.  Democratic leaders in the state Senate praised the budget for making investments in the social safety net and early childhood education.  The budget included a repeal of the state‚Äôs maximum family grant rule, which prevents people on welfare from receiving additional public money if they have more children.  Without the rule, households would receive an additional $122 a month for a newborn child. The change is expected to cost the state about $220 million a year.  ‚ÄúOur expenditure plan funds anti-poverty programs, child care and education,‚Äù said Mark Leno, Democratic state senator and budget chair.  ‚ÄúIt also includes resources to combat homelessness, support low-income working families and improve college readiness and enrollment,‚Äù he said. Republicans and some Democrats complained the spending increase of $6.9 billion from the prior fiscal year set California on a path of billion-dollar deficits down the road.  ‚ÄúCalifornians deserve a responsible and sustainable state spending plan,‚Äù said Senate Republican leader Jean Fuller.  ‚ÄúUnfortunately, this record spending budget paves the way for future deficits and increases fees that make living in California even more expensive,‚Äù she said.  Some of the spending increases were attributed to an increase in the minimum wage and increased benefits for the disabled.  In a tweet, Brown said: ‚ÄúGood work from the state legislature: we‚Äôre building reserves and investing in CA. Thanks.‚Äù  Brown has until the end of the month to sign the budget.

"Senators, Trump open to ban on some gun sales after Orlando","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators signaled on Wednesday a new willingness to consider restrictions on the sale of guns after the Orlando nightclub massacre, with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and others in his party ready to discuss limited gun control measures.  With Republicans and the National Rifle Association gun lobby under pressure to respond to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, Trump said he would meet with the NRA to discuss ways to block people on terrorism watch or no-fly lists from buying guns.  Emotions have run high in Congress since Sunday‚Äôs mass shooting with Democrats stalling Senate proceedings on Wednesday in a bid to push for tougher gun control legislation. Democratic senators planned to speak on the Senate floor well into Wednesday night.  The Senate began discussions on legislation to ban firearm sales to the hundreds of thousands of people on U.S. terrorism watch lists after a gunman who had been on such a list killed 49 people at a gay nightclub on Sunday. But following a full day of wrangling, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said that negotiations ‚Äúwere little more than a smokescreen by Republicans trying to give themselves political cover while they continue to march in lock-step with the NRA‚Äôs extreme positions.‚Äù Reid said there were no Republican proposals ‚Äúthat come close to attracting Democratic support.‚Äù Earlier on Wednesday, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged senators to offer ideas on how to prevent another attack like the one in Orlando.  ‚ÄúI do not believe this was some random act of violence,‚Äù McConnell said. ‚ÄúIt seems clear this was cold-blooded murder committed by a terrorist who picked his targets with deliberate malice.‚Äù On Tuesday, McConnell said that ‚Äúnobody wants terrorists to have firearms.‚Äù  Earlier in the week, some Democrats in the House of Representatives interrupted a moment of silence for the victims, with shouts of ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the bill?‚Äù to protest the Republican-led chamber‚Äôs refusal to consider tougher gun laws.   If Congress was to pass a gun control measure, it would mark the first time in more than 20 years that lawmakers agreed on how to address the hot-button issue. A ban on semi-automatic assault weapons, such as the one used in Orlando, had gone into effect in 1994 and expired 10 years later. Republicans over the years have blocked gun control measures saying they step on Americans‚Äô right to bear arms as guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, confirmed that he and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein were holding private talks on a possible compromise bill stopping weapons sales to those on watch lists.      Another Republican, Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, also is working on a bill that would keep guns from people on watch lists, a gun control group said. Toomey, who is in a possibly difficult re-election bid this year, took to the Senate floor urging compromise. ‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs an obvious opportunity here guys, to work together and find a solution,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúThis is not rocket science to figure this out.‚Äù A spokeswoman for Toomey, E.R. Anderson, said the senator was seeking bipartisan support for an approach that he had tentatively agreed on with gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, which is backed by ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Everytown spokeswoman Erika Lamb said the group was encouraged by the discussions but added, ‚ÄúWe are not there yet and our support for any compromise legislation is contingent on support from both Republicans and Democrats.‚Äù Toomey‚Äôs bill would allow the U.S. attorney general to create a new list of ‚Äúlikely terrorists‚Äù and block any person on the list from buying or selling a gun. If someone was denied a gun, he or she would be entitled to a swift court hearing where the attorney general would have to turn over the evidence against the person. Democrats were dubious. One problem, a Democratic aide said, was that under the proposal officials would just have three days to try to block sales to anyone not already on the new list. Congressional Republicans and the NRA have thwarted previous gun control measures backed by President Barack Obama and other Democrats after other mass shootings, and supporters of new restrictions remained cautious about the moves. ‚ÄúThe Cornyn bill is outlandish and is worse than nothing. From what I‚Äôm told all of the compromises proposed by Cornyn and Toomey are not at all acceptable,‚Äù said Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat of New York.     Feinstein, speaking to reporters following a closed briefing from the Obama administration on the Orlando massacre, held out little hope her talks with Cornyn would bear fruit. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to work out,‚Äù she said, but added she was still engaged in talks. Trump said on Twitter he would meet with the NRA ‚Äúabout not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no-fly list, to buy guns.‚Äù His campaign did not specify what he might support legislatively, and a spokeswoman declined to give details about the timing or nature of the meeting. The NRA, a politically influential lobbying group that claims more than 4 million members, said in a statement it was ‚Äúhappy to meet‚Äù with Trump, whom it endorsed for president on May 20. The group said in a statement that anyone on a terrorism watch list who tries to buy a gun ‚Äúshould be thoroughly investigated‚Äù by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and any sale to that person delayed, a position the lobby group has long held. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has supported gun control efforts, on Monday said she was ‚Äúbewildered‚Äù that Republicans in Congress in December had blocked a Democratic effort to restrict gun sales to people on the watch lists. The U.S. government maintains two terrorism watch lists: a no-fly list barring people from flying to and from the United States and a larger one that subjects travelers to greater scrutiny at airports and border crossings. An FBI official said in 2014 there were 64,000 people on the no-fly list and 800,000 on the broader list. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, the U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrants, was on the broader list at one time. NRA Executive Director Chris Cox also voiced backing for legislation offered in December by Cornyn, who proposed to put gun sales on hold for 72 hours for people on watch lists. Critics have said such background checks could take longer to complete. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was too soon to tell if Republicans would support ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù steps like blocking firearm sales to people on the no-fly lists.

Trump backs surveillance of mosques despite criticism of rhetoric,"(Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday called for surveillance of mosques as part of U.S. law enforcement efforts to prevent terrorism, and stood by his remarks on banning Muslim immigrants, which others in his party have criticized. Trump repeated his call for a temporary ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States after a U.S.-born Muslim, the son of Afghan immigrants, fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando early on Sunday. The New York real estate developer said that while the Florida gunman was born in the United States, ‚Äúhis parents weren‚Äôt and his ideas weren‚Äôt born here.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques and we have to check other places because this is a problem that, if we don‚Äôt solve it, it‚Äôs going to eat our country alive,‚Äù Trump said at a rally in Atlanta. Trump had called for surveillance of mosques in November, as well as a database of Syrian refugees entering the United States. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed by authorities to have acted alone, inspired by radical ideology he was exposed to over the internet. ‚ÄúAny kind of extremism and violence is not preached in American mosques,‚Äù said Ibrahim Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ‚ÄúIn fact, research has shown that mosques are a moderating influence on individuals who attend.‚Äù Prominent Republicans this week distanced themselves from Trump‚Äôs comments about Muslims.  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday he did not think a ban on the entry of Muslims was in U.S. interests. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination and has been a fierce critic since, said that he was ‚Äúunnerved‚Äù by Trump‚Äôs response. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said on Wednesday that Trump‚Äôs rhetoric had grown ‚Äúeven more inflammatory‚Äù in recent days. She said the United States counts on Muslim communities in the U.S. and partners in majority-Muslim countries to help fight terrorism. ‚ÄúNot one of Donald Trump‚Äôs reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando,‚Äù Clinton said at an event for U.S. military families in Virginia. Trump on Monday proposed that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is ‚Äúa proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.‚Äù He also said radical Muslims were entering the country amid a flood of refugees and ‚Äútrying to take over our children.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs hard-line proposals on immigration have contributed to his popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered condemnation from minority and human rights activists and his political opponents, many of whom have called his rhetoric racist. The New York businessman also said in Atlanta he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if he came to the United States, and he dismissed the controversy he caused in May when he said in a Reuters interview he would be willing to speak to Kim. ‚ÄúIf he came here, I‚Äôd accept him.

U.S. signals accommodation of Israeli terms on defense aid,"WASHINGTON/HERZLIYA, Israel (Reuters) - The Obama administration is prepared to incorporate missile defense funds in a new long-term agreement on military aid for Israel, a U.S. official said on Wednesday, accommodating in principle a key request by its ally in the yet-unresolved talks. Disputes over the scope and fine print of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) have clouded already difficult ties between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama during the latter‚Äôs final months in office. The current MOU, signed in 2007 and due to expire in 2018, gave Israel around $30 billion in so-called foreign military financing. Israel has been seeking around $10 billion more for the next decade and that money be earmarked for missile defense projects that were hitherto funded ad hoc by the U.S. Congress. U.S. negotiators previously proposed a total of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion annually for Israel under the new MOU, but did not say whether this might include missile defense funds. A senior U.S. official was more forthcoming on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe are prepared to make an unprecedented multi-year missile defense commitment as part of a new memorandum of understanding with Israel on military assistance,‚Äù the official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters. ‚ÄúThis commitment, which would amount to billions of dollars over 10 years, would be the first long-term pledge on missile defense support to Israel, affording Israel robust support for its missile defense, as well as predictability and facilitating long-term planning.‚Äù U.S. lawmakers have in recent years given Israel up to $600 million in annual discretionary funds for missile defense, well beyond the $150 million requested by the Obama administration. On Tuesday, the White House opposed a proposal to include $600 million for Israeli missile defense to an appropriations bill for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. Netanyahu came out with a rare statement on the MOU talks, in the face of Israeli opposition accusations that he is endangering American largesse by feuding with Obama over Iran‚Äôs nuclear program and Palestinian peace talks. Netanyahu‚Äôs office said on Twitter that the White House‚Äôs move on Tuesday was part of an ‚Äúinternal debate‚Äù with Congress about supplementary missile defense funding for Israel. ‚ÄúThere has been no cut in American assistance,‚Äù it tweeted. ‚ÄúPrime Minister Netanyahu is working to anchor this supplement as part of the discussions on the assistance agreement for the next ten years.

Israeli officials have hinted that, if the disputes persist, they might await the next U.S. president in hope of getting a better MOU.

But he added: ‚ÄúWhen we conclude that we have arrived at the final (U.S.) offer, we will decide if we want it or not.‚Äù  Another sticking point has been a U.S. demand to reduce the amount of aid money - now 26.3 percent - that Israel can spend on its own military industries rather than on American products.  Visiting Israel for strategic talks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said it had received $8.5 million a day from the Obama administration in defense aid. In a speech to the annual Herzliya Conference, Blinken did not give details on the MOU talks, but he said Washington was ready to give Israel ‚Äúthe largest single pledge of military assistance from the United States to any country in our history, cementing an unparalleled security relationship all the way to 2029‚Äù.

Sanders not ending campaign in Thursday's video speech: spokesman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders does not plan to suspend his campaign and endorse presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in a video speech to supporters on Thursday, focusing instead on ways to pursue his policy agenda and reform goals, a spokesman said. Sanders, who has resisted pressure to exit the race and back Clinton in a show of party unity since she clinched the Democratic nomination last week, will address supporters nationwide on a video live stream on Thursday night. That raised expectations Sanders might formally pull the plug on his campaign. But spokesman Michael Briggs said on Wednesday the speech will focus on how Sanders‚Äô supporters can keep the fight alive on priorities such as raising the minimum wage and reducing the influence of big money in politics. ‚ÄúTomorrow night, no, he‚Äôs not ending it,‚Äù Briggs said of the campaign. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working our way through that, how to go forward on that front. This message to supporters is going to be a lot broader than that.‚Äù Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has promised to continue his campaign to next month‚Äôs Democratic nominating convention in Philadelphia as leverage to force concessions from Clinton on his policy goals and on reforms he seeks in the Democratic Party‚Äôs nominating process. Since Clinton secured enough delegates for the nomination last week, however, Sanders has laid off some campaign staff, stopped holding rallies and dropped plans to court unbound delegates in an unspoken acknowledgment that the former secretary of state will be the nominee. ‚ÄúHe knows how to count,‚Äù Briggs said. Sanders and Clinton met in a downtown Washington hotel for more than 90 minutes on Tuesday night to search for common ground after she won the final nominating contest in their sometimes bitter primary campaign. In similarly worded statements, both camps described the meeting as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and said the two discussed their shared goal of defeating presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. Sanders was back home in Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday to prepare his speech and consider how to keep pressuring Clinton to back issues like raising the minimum wage and fighting climate change. He also has demanded changes to the party nominating process, including replacing the Democratic National Committee leadership and eliminating superdelegates, who are unelected and are free to support any candidate. The Sanders camp has pushed for a commitment to hold votes at the convention on some of those platform issues and on changing party nominating rules. ‚ÄúWe see the convention as a serious opportunity for a serious discussion about a lot of these issues. We hope the Democratic Party establishment can figure out a way to open its arms and welcome into the party fold the people who have been excited by Bernie‚Äôs campaign,‚Äù Briggs said.

"Clinton wins D.C. primary, has 'positive' meeting with Sanders","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton formally concluded the U.S. Democratic presidential race on Tuesday with a win in the District of Columbia primary, then turned her focus to uniting the party during a 90-minute private meeting with defeated rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton, who secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination last week, met with Sanders in a downtown Washington hotel as the sometimes bitter primary combatants searched for common ground ahead of the Nov. 8 election against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Sanders has resisted pressure to bow out and endorse Clinton in a show of party unity, choosing to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions from Clinton on his policy agenda and reforms to the Democratic Party nominating process. Both camps described the meeting as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and said the two noted their shared commitment to stopping Trump and pursuing issues such as raising the minimum wage, eliminating undisclosed money in politics, making college affordable and making healthcare coverage more accessible. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said the meeting was ‚Äúa positive discussion about how best to bring more people into the political process and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation.‚Äù Also attending were Sanders‚Äô wife Jane, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the two campaign managers, Jeff Weaver for Sanders and Robby Mook for Clinton. Sanders had promised to stay in the Democratic race until the final vote was cast in the Washington, D.C., primary, although in the past week he has stopped talking about capturing the party‚Äôs nomination and instead focused on ways to advance his policy goals. He scheduled a national video address to supporters on Thursday night, telling them in an email message that ‚Äúthe political revolution continues.‚Äù At a news conference before the Washington meeting, Sanders said he would also demand changes to make the Democratic nominating process more equitable, including replacing the Democratic National Committee leadership, letting independents take part in the voting and eliminating superdelegates, who are unelected and are free to support any candidate. ‚ÄúThe time is long overdue for a fundamental transformation of the Democratic Party,‚Äù Sanders said. Clinton easily beat Sanders in the District of Columbia, winning 79 percent to his 21 percent in a primary that closed the more than four-month, state-by-state battle for the Democratic nomination that began on Feb. 1 in Iowa. During a visit to Capitol Hill earlier on Tuesday, Sanders told Democratic senators he would take his message of progressive values and party reform to the convention. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm open to that, I think we should all be open to that,‚Äù Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois told reporters afterward. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a surprise that the American people are skeptical of all of us in political life. And we ought to step back and reassess why, and what we can do about it.‚Äù Top Democrats have taken steps in the last week to begin rallying behind Clinton and ease Sanders out of the race without alienating his supporters.  President Barack Obama endorsed Clinton on Thursday, hours after meeting with Sanders at the White House. Clinton also secured the endorsement of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leader of the party‚Äôs progressive wing. Clinton already has turned her attention on the campaign trail to the race with Trump, rejecting the New York businessman‚Äôs renewed calls for a ban of the entry of foreign-born Muslims into the United States after the mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, by an American man who claimed allegiance with Islamic State militants. ‚ÄúI have clearly said that we faced terrorist enemies who use a perverted version of Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. We have to stop them, and we will,‚Äù Clinton said in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday. ‚ÄúBut I will not demonize and declare war on an entire religion.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
Senate leader McConnell says 'nobody wants terrorists to have firearms',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that ‚Äúnobody wants terrorists to have firearms‚Äù and that he was open to suggestions from experts on legislation that could address the problem, following the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. McConnell, a Republican, made his remarks amid blistering attacks by Democrats on the lack of action in Congress on legislation to prevent suspects on ‚Äúwatch lists‚Äù from purchasing guns or explosives. While there was no firm evidence of Republicans and Democrats in either the Senate or House of Representatives moving toward a compromise, there were hints they at least might be willing to talk. ‚ÄúMaybe we can find some middle ground. I hope so,‚Äù said Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. The debate in Congress over firearms was reignited on Sunday after a gunman in Orlando, Florida, armed with an assault rifle killed 49 people at a gay nightclub and injured 53 others before he was shot to death by law enforcement officers. The assailant, New York-born Omar Mateen, had been investigated by the FBI for 10 months in 2013 and 2014 over possible connections he had to foreign militant groups. Democrats are pressuring Republicans in the Senate and House to quickly bring up legislation closing a loophole that allows those on ‚Äúno fly‚Äù watch lists to purchase weapons in the United States. The Democrats are targeting a Justice Department appropriations bill this week, hoping to add an amendment prohibiting such gun sales. A similar effort last December failed. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no excuse for allowing suspected terrorists to buy guns,‚Äù said Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. McConnell took a swipe at the Democrats, saying: ‚ÄúOur suspicion is this is basically a politically motivated effort that we‚Äôre likely to see‚Äù on the Justice Department spending bill. The Republican leader added, however: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre open - nobody wants terrorists to have firearms - we‚Äôre open to serious suggestions from the experts as to what we might be able to do to be helpful.‚Äù On Wednesday, senators from both parties will have an opportunity to speak directly to some experts when Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson are scheduled to brief them on the Orlando attack. The officials briefed House members on Tuesday and several House Democrats brought up the watch list issue. ‚ÄúThere was some question about procedures going forward,‚Äù said Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in that chamber, told reporters that law enforcement was already being notified if people being investigated for terrorism try to buy firearms. ‚ÄúIf you listen, they are being notified.‚Äù Durbin said he and his colleagues might pursue other gun-related amendments as well, including tougher background checks on gun buyers, closing some gun show loopholes and possibly new limits on assault rifles like the one used in Orlando.

"Obama, Clinton scold Trump over proposed Muslim ban","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic President Barack Obama denounced Donald Trump for his proposed U.S. ban on Muslim immigrants on Tuesday, joining Hillary Clinton in portraying the Republican presidential candidate as unfit for the White House. Clearly annoyed, Obama responded to Trump‚Äôs proposed suspension of immigration from countries with a ‚Äúhistory of terrorism‚Äù after Sunday‚Äôs killing of 49 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub.  Obama and Clinton, the Democrat he has endorsed to succeed him in a Nov. 8 election, made nearly simultaneous speeches. The gunman was U.S.-born Omar Mateen, 29, whose parents immigrated from Afghanistan. Trump had criticized Obama for not using the term ‚Äúradical Islamic terrorism‚Äù to describe Islamic State militants. ‚ÄúWhat exactly would using this label accomplish, what exactly would it change?‚Äù Obama replied. ‚ÄúSomeone seriously thinks we don‚Äôt know who we‚Äôre fighting? ... There‚Äôs no magic to the phrase ‚Äòradical Islam.‚Äô It‚Äôs a political talking point. It is not a strategy.‚Äù ‚ÄúCalling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction,‚Äù said Obama, criticizing the ‚Äúyapping‚Äù and ‚Äúloose talk‚Äù he said he hears from Republicans. Obama, who canceled a joint campaign appearance with Clinton planned on Wednesday in Wisconsin due to the events in Orlando, appeared to be enjoying his role in the campaign to select his successor. He tangled with Trump in 2011, producing his birth certificate to refute Trump‚Äôs claim that the president was not born in the United States. ‚ÄúWe now have proposals from the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States to bar all Muslims from immigrating to America. We hear language that singles out immigrants and suggests entire religious communities are complicit in violence,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWhere does this stop?‚Äù  On Tuesday, Trump was unrelenting in his criticism of Obama, saying in a statement that Obama ‚Äúclaims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen I am president, it will always be America first,‚Äù said Trump. Aides said Trump, who on Monday said Obama should resign for failing to handle the threat properly, would have more to say at a rally later in Greensboro, North Carolina. The crossfire overshadowed the last Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. Clinton was to meet rival Bernie Sanders late in the day with Sanders apparently inching toward ending his candidacy. Clinton, Obama‚Äôs former secretary of state, addressed supporters in Pittsburgh. The candidate said Trump‚Äôs proposal bolstered her case that he was temperamentally unfit to serve as president, saying the commander in chief ‚Äúis a job that demands a calm, collected and dignified response‚Äù to events like the Orlando massacre. Clinton said Trump seemed to suggest on Monday in a television interview that Obama might have somehow been responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, a point that Trump said he did not make. ‚ÄúI have to ask: Will responsible Republican leaders stand up to their presumptive nominee or will they stand by his accusation about our president?‚Äù she said. The biting criticism was likely to increase the discomfort among many establishment Republican leaders about Trump with little more than a month until party figures gather in Cleveland July 18-21 to formally nominate him. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican who was his party‚Äôs 2012 vice presidential nominee, on Tuesday distanced himself from the proposed Muslim ban in a further sign of establishment unease with Trump‚Äôs agenda. ‚ÄúI do not think a Muslim ban is in our country‚Äôs interests,‚Äù said Ryan, who last year criticized Trump‚Äôs original proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Ryan and like-minded leading Republicans have struggled to reconcile their desire to unify the party before a tough fight against Clinton while at the same time separating themselves from some of the positions and rhetoric of Trump, who defeated 16 rivals to win the presidential nomination battle. U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who sources say is among the Republicans that Trump is considering for his vice presidential nominee, said he was ‚Äúdiscouraged‚Äù by the way the Trump campaign was going. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt the type of speech one would expect,‚Äù Corker said of Trump‚Äôs Monday speech in New Hampshire. Trump has been resolute in demanding tighter immigration policies, and the Orlando attack has prompted him to intensify his rhetoric as he tries to win more support from Americans with deep security fears. Trump noted that Mateen‚Äôs parents were born in Afghanistan. Pointing to specific incidents such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he said threats were posed by people with roots in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. Trump on Tuesday met at Trump Tower in New York with a host of Republican governors, including Oklahoma‚Äôs Mary Fallin, who a source close to the campaign said was also on Trump‚Äôs short list to be his vice presidential running mate. A Republican official said others in the meeting included the governors of Mississippi, Arizona, Arkansas, Nebraska and Tennessee, as well as New Jersey‚Äôs Chris Christie, a close Trump adviser and former presidential rival. Trump was celebrating his 70th birthday on Tuesday. Clinton is 68. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
"After Florida shooting, Trump hardens stance on Muslims","MANCHESTER, N.H./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Monday placed responsibility for a mass shooting in Florida squarely at the feet of radical Muslims, who he said were entering the country amidst a flood of refugees and ‚Äútrying to take over our children.‚Äù The presumptive Republican presidential nominee drew on the country‚Äôs deadliest mass shooting to sharpen his vow to ban Muslim immigrants, proposing that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is ‚Äúa proven history of terrorism.‚Äù In his national security speech, Trump said it was time to ‚Äútell the truth about radical Islam,‚Äù the day after 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando by a gunman, likely self-radicalized, who had sworn allegiance to the rebel group Islamic State. His comments contrasted sharply to those of Hillary Clinton, the wealthy businessman‚Äôs likely Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, who urged increased intelligence gathering and more airstrikes on Islamic State territory, and cautioned against ‚Äúdemonizing‚Äù American Muslims. ‚ÄúIf we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans - women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people - then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now,‚Äù Trump told the crowd in New Hampshire. He went on to lambaste Clinton‚Äôs policies, saying they would allow ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East‚Äù to enter the United States without adequate security measures. There would be ‚Äúno system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of... their children,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot only their children, by the way. They‚Äôre trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is, and we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù Trump said that, if elected, he would use the executive authority of the presidency to impose stronger controls on immigration to protect Americans from attacks, fine-tuning his earlier campaign promise to temporarily ban the entry of foreign Muslims to shore up national security. ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats,‚Äù he said. He noted that the parents of the Florida gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, were born in Afghanistan. Pointing to specific incidents such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Trump said threats were posed by people with roots in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. The immigration ban, he said would last until ‚Äúwe are in a position to properly screen these people coming into our country. They‚Äôre pouring in, and we don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs hard-line proposals on immigration have helped fuel his surge in popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered heavy condemnation from minority and human rights activists, and his political opponents - many of whom have called his rhetoric racist. Trump has rejected the criticism, and has said he is often misunderstood by the media and his opponents. ‚ÄòANTI-WOMAN, ANTI-GAY‚Äô In her response to the Florida massacre, Clinton, warned against demonizing Muslim Americans and called for increased efforts to remove Islamic State propaganda from the internet, more air strikes in areas held by the group and better coordination with allies in the region.  ‚ÄúThe Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very strong, and we must attack it,‚Äù she said in a speech in Cleveland. She specifically criticized three U.S. allies - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait - for allowing its citizens to fund mosques and schools that train jihadists.  She also proposed stricter gun control laws, reiterating previous calls to prohibit people on terrorism watch lists from buying firearms. She pointed out that while the Federal Bureau of Investigation was aware of Mateen as a possible threat, he was still able to purchase a gun legally.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that we stop the terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attacks, and that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino,‚Äù California, Clinton said, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd. Trump challenged Clinton to explain why she favored letting Syrian civil war refugees into the United States. He said his policies would better protect American women, gays and lesbians, Jews and Christians. Trump‚Äôs support among women and gay voters lags far behind that of Clinton. ‚ÄúRadical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American,‚Äù said Trump.  He accused her of having ties to Saudi Arabia. ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays,‚Äù he said in a Facebook post. ‚ÄúHillary must return all money from such countries!‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 "
Trump revokes Washington Post's campaign press credentials,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump said on Monday he will no longer issue press credentials to the Washington Post, stopping the publication from gaining access to press areas at his presidential campaign events. The Washington Post, based in the U.S. capital, is one the country‚Äôs the most influential newspapers and has one of the largest circulations.  ‚ÄúThey have no journalistic integrity and write falsely about Mr. Trump,‚Äù his campaign said in a statement explaining the decision. ‚ÄúMr. Trump does not mind a bad story, but it has to be honest.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs campaign repeated criticism the candidate has made of Post owner Jeff Bezos, who also owns online retailer Amazon.com. It is unusual for a presidential campaign to refuse to issue credentials to news organizations. Credentials are needed for reporters, photographers and other staff to gain access to press seating, travel with the campaign and attend media-only events, like press conferences. ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs decision to revoke The Washington Post‚Äôs press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press,‚Äù the newspaper‚Äôs editor, Marty Baron, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWhen coverage doesn‚Äôt correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished. The Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along ‚Äî honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically, and unflinchingly. We‚Äôre proud of our coverage, and we‚Äôre going to keep at it.‚Äù A source close to the campaign said the ban could be temporary and pointed out that Trump has already barred other new organizations, including Politico, from obtaining press credentials and then reversed course. Ben Smith, executive editor of Buzzfeed, responded that his news organization, which targets millennials, is also banned from covering official Trump events. The Huffington Post posted on Twitter that its reporters are also barred. ‚ÄúA candidate for the highest elected office in the land doesn‚Äôt get to choose what goes in a newspaper,‚Äù said Committee to Protect Journalist Deputy Executive Director Robert Mahoney. ‚ÄúIt provides a ready-made excuse for authoritarian leaders to crackdown further on independent journalists.

Clinton calls for U.S. ‚Äòintelligence surge‚Äô in wake of Orlando attack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Monday that if elected, she would pressure U.S. technology companies to help intelligence agencies disrupt violent plots after a gunman inspired by radical Islamist groups killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub. In a speech in Cleveland, she articulated plans for expanded online surveillance of potential extremist attackers. She is campaigning against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of the November presidential election.  ‚ÄúWe already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôve proposed an ‚Äòintelligence surge‚Äô to bolster our capabilities across the board, with appropriate safeguards here at home.‚Äù While Clinton did not detail what her effort would entail, she said she wants technology companies to be more cooperative to government requests for help in countering online propaganda, tracking patterns in social media and intercepting communications. Clinton‚Äôs comments will likely further stoke an international debate over digital privacy, which has flared  after attacks in Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, California. Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old Orlando shooter and a U.S. citizen, was likely inspired by jihadist content online, but there is not yet evidence that he was part of any plot directed by others outside the United States, FBI Director James Comey said Monday. Facebook (FB.O), Alphabet‚Äôs Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) have all dedicated more resources to combating online propaganda and recruiting by Islamic militants within the past year. But they do so quietly to avoid the perception that they are overly cozy with authorities. The companies rely heavily on users to flag problematic content, which is impossible to eliminate completely without creating a highly censored Internet, according to technologists.  Counterterrorism experts have also long said so-called lone wolf attackers are difficult to track and stop because they often do not communicate their plans to others. Twitter and Facebook had no immediate response to questions about Clinton‚Äôs comments. Google declined comment. The Center for Democracy and Technology and Electronic Frontier Foundation, both digital advocacy groups, said they were waiting for more specifics from Clinton before commenting. Unlike Trump, Clinton did not call for blocking online content. She did not reiterate her previous push for a massive effort to break encryption, and she ruled out targeted surveillance of Muslim Americans as ‚Äúdangerous.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 "
Trump's post-Orlando message falls flat with Republican establishment,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The mass shooting in Orlando, Florida has allowed Donald Trump to seize upon a familiar issue he has used to great advantage -the threat of Islamist militants and his plan to limit Muslim immigration to the United States, offering him what could be a crucial moment to re-boot his sputtering presidential campaign.  But while rank-and-file voters might respond positively to Trump‚Äôs renewed call for a ban on some Muslims entering the country, his reaction to the massacre showed few initial signs of winning over Republican foreign-policy figures who have spurned the New York mogul. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a missed opportunity to present a different image,‚Äù said Peter Feaver, a top National Security Council aide in the George W. Bush White House. ‚ÄúHe has doubled down on policies I oppose and that aren‚Äôt going to solve the problem.‚Äù Trump said in a speech Monday in New Hampshire he would suspend immigration from countries ‚Äúwhere there is a proven history of terrorism‚Äù against the United States. He said radical Muslim immigrants were ‚Äútrying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS (Islamic State) is.‚Äù After the worst mass murder in modern U.S. history on Sunday left 50 dead, Trump‚Äôs speech was hastily refashioned from a broad critique of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to a dire warning of the threat from Islamist militants. Although Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. officials have maintained that Omar Mateen‚Äôs motives were unclear and that he had no known direct links with the Syria-based group. Mateen, they said, was likely radicalized over the Internet. A week ago, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee‚Äôs bid was taking on water. He was being battered by fellow Republicans for his comments about the Hispanic heritage of a federal judge, and Clinton was pulling away in the polls. A renewed focus on national security could provide Trump with the chance to expand his appeal both to undecided voters and to the Republican foreign-policy establishment. While Trump at times seems to relish being at odds with the establishment, the unhappiness among the party‚Äôs hawks isn‚Äôt just a matter of hand-wringing. It means if Trump does reach the White House, he could have a difficult time recruiting talented, experienced advisers.  Max Boot, an influential conservative at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Orlando tragedy ‚Äúcould have provided an opening for Trump to rally Republicans against terrorism.‚Äù But instead, Boot said, Trump has been ‚Äúpartisan and petty.‚Äù Boot criticized Trump for suggesting on Monday that President Barack Obama may sympathize with radicalized Muslims and for reviving the proposed Muslim ban. ‚ÄúHis performance has been in character,‚Äù Boot said, ‚Äúwhich is to say appalling.‚Äù Trump has alarmed some mainstream Republicans with vows to shred international trade deals, his demands that Mexico pay for a border wall and his questioning of U.S. foreign policy pillars such as its security commitments to NATO and Asian allies.  Clinton struck a very different tone in a speech on Monday, urging ‚Äústatesmanship, not partisanship‚Äù and ‚Äúclear, rational discussion‚Äù on how to protect the United States from terrorist threats. Eliot Cohen, a top-ranking State Department official during the Bush administration, called Trump‚Äôs reaction to the shootings ‚Äúopportunistic and shallow‚Äù and ‚Äúnot what Americans expect from a president.‚Äù   Lanhee Chen, a top aide to Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential campaign, suggested Trump will not be able to refine his image. ‚ÄúWhile it would be true in most cases a big speech like this could reset the decks, I think the challenge with Donald Trump is always who he is at his core,‚Äù Chen said. But voters are another matter. Trump‚Äôs swift rise within the Republican Party was at least partly due to the strident tone he has taken toward immigrants and refugees. When Trump responded to last year‚Äôs terror attacks in Paris and California with a call for banning Muslims from entering the country, he surged in the Reuters/Ipsos poll in the weeks that followed, opening up a 30-point lead over his Republican primary rivals.  Republicans continue to be strongly supportive of Trump‚Äôs approach to handling terrorism. This month, two-thirds of Republicans said they agreed with Trump‚Äôs proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.  Overall, 42 percent of Americans said they agreed with a Muslim ban while 50 percent said they disagreed, with another 8 percent not sure, according to another Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 17 to June 6. The poll of more than 6,000 people has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 1.5 percentage points. Combating Islamist extremism was on the mind of Texas billionaire Doug Deason, a major Republican donor who told Reuters he will meet with Trump later in the week to discuss his support.  Nothing Trump has said since the Orlando shooting has caused him to re-think backing him, Deason said.  Peter King, a U.S. congressman from New York, said his party‚Äôs foreign-policy establishment will eventually have to get on board with Trump. ‚ÄúAs one of the two major candidates for president, he will have to get advice or consultation with top national-security people,‚Äù King said.

"Trump adds new twist to immigration proposals, but legal doubts persist","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal for suspending immigration from parts of the world with a history of terrorism could have a legal basis, but his assertion that it be part of a broader ban on Muslim immigrants makes it constitutionally untenable, legal scholars say. The new twist in Trump‚Äôs anti-Muslim rhetoric came in the aftermath of a weekend shooting massacre at a Florida nightclub by the American-born son of Afghan immigrants. In a fiery speech on Monday, he expanded on his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, vowing if elected to halt immigration from any area of the world where there is a ‚Äúproven history of terrorism‚Äù against America or its allies. He also accused the Muslim-American community of broad complicity in attacks such as the Orlando shooting, which was carried out by a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State, and threatened ‚Äúbig consequences‚Äù for those who fail to inform on their neighbors. Many legal experts said Trump‚Äôs proposal for a religion-based ban would be unlikely to pass the test of U.S. constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, due process and equal protection and would likely be struck down by the courts if he tried to implement them by presidential decree. However, a ban on immigrants from certain countries has some precedent and might pass muster.¬† Some see that new proposal as reminiscent of the congressional Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was used for years to halt the influx of Chinese laborers and has been widely considered a black mark on America‚Äôs immigration record. But Trump‚Äôs overall immigration plan would go beyond that, targeting not just a country or a region of the world but also a religion, something that no modern U.S. president has done.  ‚ÄúThis is an absurd proposal to build a Fortress America and pull up the drawbridges,‚Äù said John Bellinger, former legal adviser to the Bush administration. President Barack Obama took a veiled swipe at Trump on Tuesday, saying such ideas represented a ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù mindset. But U.S. presidents have wide latitude on immigration matters, and some conservative scholars said that the fate of any proposed ban would hinge on how narrowly Trump framed it. They note, for instance, that Democratic President Jimmy Carter barred Iranian nationals from entering the United States during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. ‚ÄúIf a Trump administration cut off immigration from certain countries, rather than certain religions, it would not violate the Constitution,‚Äù said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California Berkeley and former Justice Department official who advised the George W. Bush administration on interrogation methods used on terrorism suspects. Herman Schwartz, a law professor at American University in Washington, said if Trump stuck to his proposal for a temporary prohibition on Muslim immigrants, that raises significant constitutional questions and ‚Äúshows his shaky command of the legal facts.‚Äù In Monday‚Äôs speech in New Hampshire, Trump showed little sign of scaling back his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which he first laid out in December after an Islamic State-linked deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Debate over the legality of Trump‚Äôs proposals was complicated by the vagueness of his pronouncement and questions on how broadly he would extend any immigration ban if elected. While legal experts say presidents have the power to ban immigrants from specific countries, the United States does not currently ban immigration from any country. Officials do give extra scrutiny to people entering from countries such Syria and Iran. Under the broadest interpretation of Trump‚Äôs pronouncement,  immigration could be barred not only from the Muslim world but from U.S.-allied countries in Europe and Asia where militant attacks have taken place. This could include India, the source of many skilled engineers for the U.S. technology sector. Critics say this would be impractical and counterproductive. ‚ÄúIs Mr. Trump proposing to stop issuing visas even for business or tourism or education to nationals of certain countries?‚Äù said Bellinger. ‚ÄúRather than increase economic growth, Mr. Trump‚Äôs plan could cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars.‚Äù Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump foreign policy adviser, justified the candidate‚Äôs pronouncement, saying ‚Äúit is perfectly appropriate for the country to refuse admission to those whose presence may be detrimental to the national interest.‚Äú But Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, when asked whether a president has the authority to ban immigrants based on religion, said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure he does.‚Äù Legal experts also raised doubts about the legality of Trump‚Äôs demand that members of the American Muslim community ‚Äúcooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad‚Äù or else they will be ‚Äúbrought to justice‚Äù themselves.‚Äù Critics have accused him of anti-Muslim fear-mongering to win votes. ‚ÄúGenerally, the idea that knowledge in and of itself comes with criminal liability is antithetical to the way we talk about criminal law in the United States,‚Äù said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor. If Trump tried to implement such prosecutions as president, he said, potential defendants could simply invoke their constitutional right against self-incrimination and continue to remain silent.

Obama to meet the Dalai Lama at White House on Wednesday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will meet the Dalai Lama at the White House on Wednesday, a move certain to anger China which considers the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader a dangerous separatist. Obama and the Dalai Lama will meet privately at 10:15 a.m. (1415 GMT), a White House statement said. Earlier on Tuesday, China warned the United States to stick by its promises not to support any separatist activities. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, the Dalai Lama had said it was possible he would meet Obama and on Tuesday Taiwan announced that its new president would make a transit stop in the United States next week. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said both issues touched on the ‚Äúone China‚Äù policy, a basic diplomatic tenet referring to both Taiwan and Tibet being part of China that Beijing insists foreign governments recognize. Lu said the United States had said it opposed Taiwan‚Äôs independence and recognized that Tibet was an inseparable part of China. ‚ÄúWe demand the U.S. government earnestly stands by its promises, conscientiously handle the relevant issue in accordance with the one China principle and not give any space to any individual or behavior which tries to create two Chinas, one China one Taiwan, or to split China,‚Äù he said. Obama met the Dalai Lama when the latter visited Washington in 2014 and angered China then when he vowed ‚Äústrong support‚Äù for Tibetans‚Äô human rights. The Dalai Lama says he wants genuine autonomy for Tibet rather than independence. He told Reuters Obama was a ‚Äúa long-time friend‚Äù whom he admired for his work to normalize relations with Cuba, on Iran and for his recent visits to former U.S. foe Vietnam and the site of the Hiroshima atomic bombing in Japan.  Asked how Beijing (Peking) might respond to a meeting, the Dalai Lama said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know - you should ask them. I think in Peking, we cannot as of now ... generalize. In Peking there are different views. Some people there have a more realistic view. Some are more hardline, which is more narrow-minded.‚Äù  Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen will transit in Miami on her way to Panama, one of the island‚Äôs few diplomatic allies, and stop over in Los Angeles on her return, Taiwan‚Äôs deputy foreign minister, Javier Ching-shan Hou, said. China is suspicious of Tsai, who assumed office last month, as she is also head of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Travel abroad is sensitive for Taiwanese leaders who have angered China as it is seen as exerting sovereignty. Tsai‚Äôs trip will run from June 24 to July 2 and include Paraguay.

Ex-Michigan lawmaker to stand trial; charges dismissed against another,"(Reuters) - A Michigan judge on Tuesday dismissed charges against a former state representative, while ruling another lawmaker should stand trial after he tried to hide their extramarital affair, according to a prosecutor‚Äôs office spokeswoman. Ingham County District Judge Hugh Clarke ruled that former State Representative Todd Courser should stand trial for perjury  and one count of misconduct for his attempted cover-up of the affair with fellow lawmaker Cindy Gamrat, said Andrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for the Michigan attorney general‚Äôs office. Prosecutors originally charged Courser with three counts of misconduct while in office and perjury, but the judge dismissed two of the misconduct charges. Clarke also dismissed the two criminal misconduct-in-office charges against Gamrat due to insufficient evidence that she knowingly lied to House investigators about an email that Courser sent to distract from their affair, Bitely said. Prosecutors will not appeal the dismissed charges against Gamrat, but they are reviewing their options regarding the charges against Courser that were not sent to trial, Bitely said.  An attorney for Courser, Matthew DePerno, maintained his client is not guilty, and said he believed there was not enough evidence to support the perjury or misconduct charge. Courser is due back in court in late June.      A lawyer for Gamrat, Mike Nichols, said the charges against his client stem from a house investigation that arose from a political dispute. The former legislators faced charges of misconduct related to Courser‚Äôs failed attempt to cover up their affair. He had devised a plan to distribute an email falsely claiming he had sex with a male prostitute in a move meant to blunt the political impact of the actual affair if it was ever revealed, according to the Detroit News.  The two former lawmakers also were charged with misconduct for allowing their employees to forge their signature on proposed legislation. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
Senate passes $602 billion defense authorization bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to pass a $602 billion defense authorization bill, despite President Barack Obama‚Äôs threat to veto the annual policy measure over issues including a ban on closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison. The vote was 85-13, far more than the majority needed to pass the 100-member Senate. Six Republicans and seven members of the Democratic caucus voted against the bill, which authorizes military spending for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. Obama gave a long list of objections to the versions of the bill passed by the Senate and House of Representatives, including provisions making it more difficult to close the detention center at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba and the use of funds specially designated for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to allow the military to avoid mandatory spending limits. The Senate‚Äôs version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, now must be reconciled with the one passed by the House last month before it can be sent to Obama. The House bill also faces a veto threat. If the bill is finished before November, when every member of the House and one-third of the Senate is up for re-election, a veto could prove challenging for Democrats. Obama‚Äôs party is trying to keep the White House, and hopes to regain the Senate majority it lost in 2014, if not control of the House. But Democrats perpetually battle accusations from Republicans that they are soft on defense, a fight that could be more difficult if they block the major Pentagon policy bill. Republican Senator John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said he was disappointed the bill did not include a program that would help Afghans who are in danger because they worked for American troops to move to the United States. ‚ÄúThey are the number one target for the Taliban and for ISIS (Islamic State),‚Äù McCain said in the Senate after the bill passed without an amendment extending the program to provide Special Immigrant Visas for interpreters and others who worked for U.S. forces. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who had introduced the amendment, called its omission ‚Äúunconscionable.‚Äù In a statement, she said, ‚ÄúFor many of them, this could be a death sentence.‚Äù The bill would also require young women to register for the military draft, as the Department of Defense opens all of the military, including combat roles, to females. A few conservative senators voted against the measure because of that provision. The bill passed with a compromise on the use of Russian RD-180 rocket engines. Lawmakers eased a ban on their use late last year, worried that it could drive United Launch alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, out of business and leave only privately held SpaceX to transport satellites into space. An amendment from Republican Senator Cory Gardner and Democrat Bill Nelson gives the Pentagon time to develop and test a replacement for the Russian-made engines and limits their use for launches. McCain, a harsh critic of Moscow, had tried to stop the use of the RD-180 to send a message to Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin.  The bill also bars military base closures, despite military leaders saying they have more capacity than they need. Closing bases is a thorny issue for many lawmakers, especially in an election year.

Russians steal research on Trump in hack of U.S. Democratic Party,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hackers believed to be working for the Russian government broke into the Democratic National Committee‚Äôs computer network, spied on internal communications and accessed research on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the committee and security experts said on Tuesday. Two separate groups entered the DNC‚Äôs system, and one read email and chat communications for nearly a year before being detected, according to the committee and CrowdStrike, the cyber firm that helped clean up the breach. Russian spies also targeted the networks of Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as the computers of some Republican political action committees, the Washington Post quoted U.S. officials as saying, although details were not available. A Clinton campaign official said there was no evidence the campaign‚Äôs information systems had been hacked. A Russian government spokesman denied involvement in the breach. ‚ÄúI completely rule out a possibility that the (Russian) government or the government bodies have been involved in this,‚Äù Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, told Reuters in Moscow. The intrusion is emblematic of the sophistication of Russian hackers, who intelligence officials have long viewed as the most talented of U.S. adversaries in cyberspace. The Democratic Party had been aware of efforts to hack Trump material for two months, and U.S. intelligence agencies were involved in efforts to find out who was behind the hacking, a source familiar with Trump opposition research said. The source said Democratic Party operatives believed the hacking was conducted by the Russian government. The research includes material on Trump‚Äôs business efforts in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Serbia and Russia, according to information made available to Reuters.         Cyber attacks against political candidates and organizations are common worldwide. U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said last month he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the Nov. 8 presidential election nears. U.S. Representative Jim Langevin, a Democrat and co-founder of the congressional cybersecurity caucus, said it was ‚Äúdisconcerting‚Äù that independent groups penetrated the DNC and that one was able ‚Äúto stay embedded for nearly a year.‚Äù But the groups are extremely sophisticated, Langevin said, and have previously been implicated on attacks at the White House, the State Department and the German Bundestag, as well as a number of private companies. The DNC contacted CrowdStrike in May and within 24 hours it began investigating unusual activity on the group‚Äôs network, said Dmitri Alperovitch, the company‚Äôs co-founder and chief technology officer. It identified two hacking groups and both were kicked out this weekend, he said. The first, which CrowdStrike named Cozy Bear, entered the DNC‚Äôs systems last summer, according to the firm. It primarily monitored email and chat conversations and may be working for Russia‚Äôs Federal Security Service, or FSB, Alperovitch said.  Russian President Vladimir Putin once ran the FSB. The second group, nicknamed Fancy Bear, is probably working on behalf of Russia‚Äôs military, Alperovitch said. It gained entry in late April and ‚Äúwent straight to the oppo research ... on Donald Trump and exfiltrated some of it,‚Äù he said. Alperovitch said both groups were among ‚Äúthe best threat actors that we‚Äôve ever encountered‚Äù but they did not appear to be working together. He was not sure how the intrusions occurred but suspected the hackers may have leveraged ‚Äúspearphishing‚Äù emails to trick DNC employees into downloading malicious code onto their network. ‚ÄúWhen we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is,‚Äù Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the DNC, said in a statement. ‚ÄúOur team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs interest in Russia goes back to the 1980s, with a 1990 Vanity Fair article citing news program appearances in which Trump offered his own services as a negotiator with Russia.  Information made available to Reuters indicates Trump tried on at least three occasions - in 2004, 2008 and 2013 - to get involved in business deals in Russia. In 2013, he and an Azerbaijani-Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, jointly put on a Miss Universe competition in Moscow, and Trump was photographed with Agalarov‚Äôs wife, son and daughter. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obama‚Äôs campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes. U.S. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to Chinese hackers. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
Former allies of NJ's Christie fail to dismiss Bridgegate indictment,"(Reuters) - A federal judge refused to dismiss a criminal indictment against two former allies of New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie over their alleged roles in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal, known as Bridgegate. In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton, in Newark, New Jersey, rejected arguments by William Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly that the laws under which they were charged were too vague and that they had no reason to know some of their activities might have been illegal. Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, and Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were charged with wire fraud, civil rights deprivation and conspiracy for allegedly arranging the September 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The closure led to several days of gridlock affecting the bridge, the world‚Äôs busiest, which spans the Hudson River to connect New Jersey to Manhattan. Prosecutors said it was intended to punish Fort Lee‚Äôs Democratic mayor for not endorsing Christie‚Äôs successful reelection bid. In her 23-page decision, Wigenton said reasonable public officials would understand that wrongdoing attributed to the defendants would violate drivers‚Äô right to travel. ‚ÄúPolitical payback is not a significant government interest,‚Äù she wrote. Wigenton also said it was for jurors to decide whether to hold the defendants criminally responsible for their alleged dealings with former Port Authority executive David Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and is cooperating with prosecutors. Michael Baldassare and Michael Critchley, lawyers who represent Baroni and Kelly respectively, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A trial is scheduled for Sept. 12, court records show. Christie has not been charged and has denied involvement in wrongdoing, but the scandal hurt his popularity within New Jersey and weighed on his unsuccessful 2016 presidential run.  Both defendants are also seeking records from Christie‚Äôs cellphone through subpoenas to a law firm that previously generated a taxpayer-funded report absolving the governor of wrongdoing. Critics of Christie have called that report biased. Separately, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia is weighing requests by media to publicly release a list of unindicted co-conspirators. Oral arguments were heard on June 6. The case is U.S. v. Baroni et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 15-cr-00193.     ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
Kerry launches talks with Venezuela but backs disputed referendum,"SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced high-level talks to ease tensions with Venezuela‚Äôs socialist government on Tuesday, just hours after he backed calls for a referendum that could force President Nicolas Maduro from office.   Kerry said the talks would start immediately in Caracas and be led by Thomas Shannon, a veteran of U.S. diplomacy in the region. Attempts last year at dialogue between the ideological foes were stalled by Venezuela‚Äôs deepening crisis. The two countries have been embroiled in diplomatic hostilities since the administrations of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and U.S. President George W. Bush. Kerry said the goal was to go beyond ‚Äúthe old rhetoric.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve committed to see if this can work so let‚Äôs see if we can improve the relationship,‚Äù he told reporters, after huddling with his Venezuelan counterpart on the sidelines of an Organization of American States (OAS) meeting in the Dominican Republic. The talks would also be aimed at fostering dialogue between Venezuela‚Äôs government and opposition, Kerry said. Maduro welcomed the proposed talks and repeated his suggestion that the two sides restore ambassadors in each other‚Äôs capitals after an eight-year hiatus that began when Chavez expelled the U.S. envoy to Venezuela. ‚ÄúI propose to John Kerry ‚Äòlet‚Äôs designate ambassadors‚Äô, I am ready. They have ambassadors in Beijing, Vietnam and Havana, and they don‚Äôt have one in Caracas,‚Äù he said in a speech to teachers. Maduro proposed an ambassador in 2014 but U.S. President Barack Obama has not yet accepted his credentials. Once one of Latin America‚Äôs most prosperous nations, Venezuela has plunged into unrest and a harsh economic slowdown. Long lines for food and medicines have led to protests and opposition calls for a recall referendum to remove Maduro.     That measure is allowed under the constitution, a point made by Kerry to reporters after he met Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez.  Earlier in the day, in a speech to OAS delegates, Kerry gave his backing to the referendum push and called on Chavez‚Äôs political heirs to release political prisoners and respect fundamental rights.      His comments to the 34 members of the main diplomatic body of the Americas marked the strongest show of support yet from the United States for the disputed referendum process. Venezuela‚Äôs opposition accuses the election council of stalling the recall at the behest of Maduro by arbitrarily changing criteria for requesting a recall vote. Maduro has said any recall against him would be in 2017 at the earliest, pushing back against opposition pressure. Several opposition politicians are in jail, notably hardline leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has a 14-year sentence for inciting 2014 anti-government protests that spiraled into violence killing more than 40 people. The government denies it holds political prisoners. Kerry‚Äôs comments drew a furious response from Rodriguez, who accused Washington and OAS chief Luis Almagro of ‚Äúinternational bullying.‚Äù   ‚ÄúEvery day we have evidence of the secretary general‚Äôs bias in favor of sectors of the opposition who are seeking a coup in Venezuela,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúI see now this is ordered by Washington. I know they are on Washington‚Äôs payroll to meddle in the domestic affairs of Venezuela,‚Äù she said, speaking through a translator.  Kerry was more conciliatory after his first ever bilateral meeting with Rodriguez, saying the United States did not support a push by Almagro to suspend Venezuela from the OAS for alleged violations of the regional group‚Äôs ‚Äúdemocratic charter.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe United States is not taking that position, we are not pushing for a suspension. I don‚Äôt think that would be constructive,‚Äù he said. At Almagro‚Äôs behest, the OAS will hold a meeting later this month to initiate the process that could end in Venezuela‚Äôs suspension. But the former Uruguayan foreign minister appears isolated in the group, with even right-wing governments opposed to Maduro in the region balking at throwing Venezuela out. Venezuela and the United States have repeatedly gone through periods of diplomatic fighting followed by generally short-lived eras of reconciliation.  Following Washington‚Äôs 2014 rapprochement with Cuba, Shannon met with a top Venezuelan Socialist Party official to improve ties with Caracas. The good mood soured within months when the United States criticized the sentence handed to opposition leader Lopez. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
Senators introduce bill aimed at getting generic drugs to market,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four U.S. senators - two Democrats and two Republicans - introduced a bill on Tuesday aimed at preventing big pharmaceutical companies from using safety rules to prevent generic drugs from coming to market. Senators Charles Grassley, chair of the Judiciary Committee, and Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat, are sponsors of the bill along with Senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the chair of the antitrust subcommittee and top Democrat, respectively. The Food and Drug Administration, which ensures the safety of the country‚Äôs food and drug supply, has a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, called REMS, which is designed to ensure that the riskiest drugs are dispensed safely. But there have been complaints that the program has been misused by brand-name drug companies to prevent generic manufacturers from getting the drug samples needed to market cheaper versions. Generic companies also complain their drugs are not allowed to share a safety protocol, making it difficult to come to market. The bill would allow a generic manufacturer who faces either of these situations to file a lawsuit to force access to a sample or force negotiations for a safety protocol. ‚ÄúBalancing the cost of developing lifesaving medications with the need to make available affordable prescription drugs to consumers has always been a difficult task.¬†It‚Äôs a consistent topic at my town meetings,‚Äù Grassley said in a statement. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we‚Äôre seeing some brand-name drug companies engage in anti-competitive tactics that delay entry of lower cost generic drugs into the market.¬†This bill takes important steps to ensure that our laws are not frustrated.‚Äù There is a similar bill in the House of Representatives which addresses the same issue but uses a different strategy. For example, it requires the generic company seeking a REMS drug to get FDA authorization to obtain the sample. In one of the REMS disputes which is public, Mylan Pharmaceuticals filed a lawsuit in 2014 against Celgene Corp, accusing it of using REMS to prevent generic copies of Thalomid and Revlimid to market. The Senate Judiciary Committee‚Äôs antitrust panel will hold a hearing on its bill on June 21. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, which counts major drugmakers among its members, said it had no immediate comment. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association was pleased to see the bill introduced. ‚ÄúIt is worth noting and recognizing recent efforts by representatives in the branded industry to highlight the valuable role generic medicines play in driving healthcare system savings,‚Äù said Chip Davis, GPhA‚Äôs president. ‚ÄúContinued use of these anticompetitive practices by certain manufacturers drives the exact opposite outcome.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
Trump gains slightly on Clinton after Florida attack: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lead over Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race has narrowed since late last week, according to the results of the first Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted since the Orlando shooting rampage on Sunday. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has blamed Democratic policies for the worst mass shooting in U.S. history and doubled-down on his pledge to ban Muslim immigration, while Clinton has warned against demonizing Muslim-Americans. The poll, conducted from Friday to Tuesday, showed Clinton with an 11.6-point lead - 44.6 percent to 33.0 percent - over Trump, down from the 13-point lead she had in the five days that ended Saturday. The Florida attack, in which a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub and wounded 53 could have a lingering impact on the presidential race, mixing concerns about immigration, gun violence and religious tolerance into what has already been a volatile and sharply negative campaign.  The shooter, Omar Mateen, 29, the U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrant parents, called authorities during the massacre to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State militant group. Federal investigators have said Mateen, who was killed by police, was likely self-radicalized and there was no evidence he received any instruction or aid from outside groups such as Islamic State.  Trump seized on the attack to accuse Democratic President Barack Obama of failing to address ‚Äúradical Islamic terrorism,‚Äù to warn that Clinton‚Äôs policies on immigration would allow more potential attackers into the country, and to fine-tune his call for a suspension of Muslim immigration. In a speech on Monday, Trump said he would suspend immigration from countries with a ‚Äúproven history of terrorism‚Äù against the United States, Europe and allied countries ‚Äúuntil we fully understand how to end these threats.‚Äù Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee,  said Trump‚Äôs response to the attack was disturbing. ‚ÄúPrejudice, paranoia and partisanship are not a plan, and will not protect anyone,‚Äù Clinton said in a statement.     She re-emphasized her support for coordinated military action in Syria and Iraq and called for tougher controls on firearms sales. Clinton‚Äôs slip in the polling was not all Trump‚Äôs gain.  The proportion of voters who said they would not vote for either candidate has risen steadily over the past week. About 22.4 percent of likely voters would not pick either candidate, according to the five-day average of results on Tuesday. That was up from 20.6 percent a week ago. Trump‚Äôs strident tone on Muslims and national security appears to have helped him in the past, at least with Republicans. He surged in opinion polls among Republicans late last year after attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. According to Reuters/Ipsos polls over the past several months, a majority of Republican voters said he was their party‚Äôs best choice to deal with terrorism and trusted him more than his Republican rivals to be commander in chief. Most Republicans also support Trump‚Äôs proposed ban on Muslim immigration, while a majority of Americans oppose it. The online poll included 1,063 likely voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 3.5 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
House votes to protect 'dark money' political donors,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to protect the identities of wealthy individuals and others who make anonymous, or ‚Äúdark money,‚Äù donations to politically active nonprofit groups. The measure, which drew lobbying support from billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, was approved in a 240-180 vote along party lines. It would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from collecting the names and addresses of donors who contribute $5,000 or more to 501(c) organizations, a name that refers to the tax code section that covers them. The action sent the bill on to the Senate. Although the measure would apply to all 501(c) tax-exempt groups, such as universities, hospitals and charities, politically active nonprofits are the intended beneficiaries. Republicans said the legislation would prevent the Internal Revenue Service from targeting conservative groups following 2013 revelations that Tea Party organizations were subjected to extra scrutiny. Political spending by nonprofit groups including the Koch- aligned Americans for Prosperity has grown dramatically since 2010, when the Supreme Court opened the way to unlimited spending on political campaigns by individuals, corporations, unions and other groups in its landmark Citizens United ruling.  The White House on Monday said it opposed the bill, the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, claiming it would constrain the IRS from enforcing tax laws and reduce transparency among private foundations. Democrats argued that the legislation could make it easier for foreign entities to finance political campaigns inside the United States.  Charity regulators have also warned that the loss of donor information would make it harder to protect the public against charity fraud. The change would reduce available information on a range of organizations, IRS data shows. Republicans said the bill is necessary to protect donors from potential leaks that could subject them to harassment. Donor identities are not supposed to be released to the public, hence the term ‚Äúdark money.‚Äù  But leaks have occurred, including the 2012 release of donors to the conservative National Organization for Marriage that resulted in a settlement requiring the IRS to pay the organization $50,000. Supporters of the legislation also pointed to signs that the IRS may seek to end the disclosure requirement on its own.     Nonprofit groups could spend more than $500 million on this year‚Äôs presidential and congressional elections, up from $10 million in 2008, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. House Republicans are also pushing to censure and impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for allegedly failing to cooperate with a probe of the IRS scandal.   ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
Justice Department should analyze Dow-DuPont deal: senator,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday urged federal antitrust officials to conduct a ‚Äúcareful analysis‚Äù of Dow Chemical Co‚Äôs proposed $130 billion merger with DuPont, adding pressure on officials to scrutinize how rapid consolidation in agriculture will affect farmers and consumers. U.S. Senator Charles Grassley called for the review in a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice‚Äôs antitrust division. The Iowa Republican said he was concerned the planned tie-up will decrease competition in the farming sector following a flood of mergers and acquisitions in recent years. He also said he was worried the deal could raise barriers to entry for smaller companies, hurt innovation and raise prices for products. Grassley‚Äôs request for a federal review increases attention on risks of consolidation as more large agribusiness deals are in the offing. Bayer AG is pursuing a $62 billion acquisition of Monsanto Co, the world‚Äôs top seed maker, while Chinese state-owned China National Chemical Corp [CNNCC.UL], or ChemChina, plans to buy Swiss crop chemicals company Syngenta AG for $43 billion. A global downturn in grain prices and a strong dollar have reduced U.S. farm income and prompted farmers to cut spending. That has eaten into sales of the big six agrochemical and seed companies that are now looking to bolster profits through mergers and partnerships. Dow expects the regulatory review of its proposed merger with DuPont ‚Äúwill be a thorough process,‚Äù a company spokeswoman said. The deal is ‚Äúpro-competitive and good for farmers and consumers,‚Äù she said. Dow has previously said it expects the deal to close in the second half of 2016. DuPont had no immediate comment. The Justice Department declined to comment. In March, Grassley, who also serves on the agriculture committee, joined other senators asking for the U.S. government panel that reviews foreign acquisitions to assess the impact of ChemChina‚Äôs planned acquisition of Syngenta on domestic food security . The U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to join the review panel, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, a move that subjects the deal to additional government scrutiny. Last month, Monsanto turned down Bayer‚Äôs acquisition attempt as ‚Äúincomplete and financially inadequate‚Äù but said it was open to further negotiations. Monsanto said the initial offer did not adequately address potential ‚Äúregulatory execution risks related to the acquisition.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
Detroit eyes refunding of up to $660 million bonds,"(Reuters) - Detroit would sell its first general obligation bonds since exiting bankruptcy in December 2014 under a proposal by Mayor Mike Duggan‚Äôs administration to refund up to $660 million of outstanding bonds. The city council on Tuesday sent the plan to refund up to $275 million of unlimited tax GO bonds sold in 2014 and up to $385 million of limited tax GO bonds sold in 2010 and 2012 to its Budget, Finance and Audit Committee for consideration.  The outstanding bonds were issued through the Michigan Finance Authority and backed by the city‚Äôs share of distributable state aid payments. John Naglick, Detroit‚Äôs finance director, said Detroit expects to capture lower interest rates in the bond refundings to save money for the budget and to lower property tax rates supporting the bonds.  ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt for this move to record low rates, we wouldn‚Äôt do this,‚Äù he said. Ten and 30-year yields on Municipal Market Data‚Äôs benchmark triple-A scale are at or near all-time lows, driven by big investor demand for debt sold by states, cities, schools and other municipal issuers. Detroit was able to shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations in the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy. In its first post-bankruptcy public debt offering last August, the city restructured $245 million of variable-rate revenue bonds backed by city income taxes into a fixed-rate mode at a hefty spread over MMD‚Äôs scale.

Kerry says U.S. and Venezuela agree to start talks to ease tensions,"SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - Venezuela and the United States will immediately start talks to ease tensions between the two countries and does not support its ouster from a regional diplomatic bloc, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday after meeting his counterpart from the OPEC nation. Venezuela is embroiled in an economic and political crisis that has led to social unrest in one of the world‚Äôs largest oil producers. The United States will send Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon, a veteran on Latin American diplomacy, as its representative to the talks, Kerry told reporters traveling with him after the bilateral meeting.   Kerry said that the United States did not support efforts by the head of the Organization of the American States to suspend Venezuela from the regional diplomatic bloc.

Senate to debate Puerto Rico debt bill: McConnell,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate this month will debate legislation that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives and aims to give Puerto Rico some relief from its $70 billion debt, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday. McConnell‚Äôs announcement came after some House members briefed fellow Republicans in the Senate on the content of the legislation, which would establish a federal oversight board to restructure Puerto Rican debt. Backers of the House-passed bill are hoping the Senate signs off on the legislation before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline on a $1.9 billion debt payment. Representative Rob Bishop, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, which steered the legislation through that chamber, told reporters that Republican senators peppered him with questions about the makeup of the oversight board and its powers. He added that he assured senators the bill is not a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico and that it would not have an impact on U.S. states. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and some critics of the bill have expressed concerns that a control board appointed by Washington might not have the Caribbean island‚Äôs best interests in mind. The legislation also got a boost, albeit a tepid one, on Tuesday when Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch offered qualified support for the House bill. He added that he was considering offering changes to the bill but did not elaborate. Hatch‚Äôs Finance Committee has oversight of the Puerto Rico debt legislation. Some Senate Democrats also have expressed reservations with the bill and indicated that they could seek amendments, but it was not clear if they actually would. Any changes made by the Senate to the House-passed bill would send it back to the House to accept, reject or make further amendments. Bishop left open the possibility of July 1 arriving with Congress still working on the Puerto Rico bill. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the end of the world,‚Äù Bishop said of the possibility of Congress putting finishing touches on legislation into July. ‚ÄúMarket forces, as long as they realize we‚Äôre moving forward to a solution and we‚Äôre close to it, I think that would mitigate against anything that would be negative that would impact the entire market,‚Äù Bishop added. The Obama administration has voiced its support for the House bill, which passed on a strong, bipartisan vote of 297-127. Puerto Rico, which suffers from a poverty rate of around 45 percent, has been hobbled by its worsening debt problems, with some schools and medical facilities closing and island residents fleeing to the mainland United States where many find jobs, primarily in central Florida.

Orlando killer expressed support for multiple Islamist groups,"ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Orlando nightclub killer Omar Mateen had expressed sympathy for a variety of Islamist extremists, including groups in the Middle East that are sworn enemies, the FBI said on Monday, as a picture began to emerge of the angry, violent man who carried out America‚Äôs deadliest mass shooting. U.S. authorities said they had found no direct links between Islamic State and Mateen, the U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrants who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando on Sunday.        Mateen, 29, was shot dead by police who stormed the Pulse club with armored cars after a three-hour siege. In 911 calls during his rampage, the killer expressed allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.     But Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey  said Mateen had made comments favorable to multiple armed Islamist movements and people, which ‚Äúadds a little bit to the confusion about his motives.‚Äù President Barack Obama said Mateen was likely a homegrown extremist.  ‚ÄúSo far, we see no indication that this was a plot directed from outside the United States and we see no indication that he was part of any kind of network,‚Äù Comey told reporters in Washington. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre highly confident this killer was radicalized at least in some part through the internet.‚Äù     Islamic State, which controls territory in Iraq and Syria, reiterated on Monday a claim of responsibility, although it offered no signs to indicate coordination with the gunman.         In calls to authorities on Sunday, Mateen also mentioned support for the Boston Marathon bombers and a Florida man who became a Nusra Front suicide bomber in Syria, Comey said. Nusra is an al Qaeda offshoot which is at odds with Islamic State in Syria‚Äôs civil war.         Co-workers reported Mateen to the FBI in 2013 after he had made ‚Äúinflammatory and contradictory‚Äù statements, including a claim that he had family connections to al Qaeda and membership of Shi‚Äôite militant group Hezbollah, a bitter rival. The FBI‚Äôs Miami office investigated Mateen for 10 months and interviewed him twice but found no evidence of a crime or connection with a militant group. Comey said the FBI was also ‚Äúworking to understand what role anti-gay bigotry may have played‚Äù in the attack.  The massacre reverberated on the presidential campaign trail, where Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, the two likely opponents in the Nov. 8 election, clashed over how to confront violent Islamist extremists.     Trump proposed suspending immigration to the United States from countries with a history of terrorism against America, Europe or U.S. allies, while Clinton warned against demonizing Muslims and called for tougher gun safety measures. Obama is to visit Orlando on Thursday to pay respects to families of the victims. The Orlando killings followed the massacre of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, last year and raised the question of whether the United States will have to confront jihadist attacks in the homeland for years to come.  Comey said tracking apparent lone wolf attackers like Mateen was like finding ‚Äúneedles in a nationwide haystack‚Äù while also trying to work out what kind of people could become radicalized. The Florida shooting spree began early on Sunday when the club was packed with some 350 revelers at a Latin music night. Many fled as the gunman raked the crowd with bullets from an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle and a pistol. An initial wave of officers charged into the club and trapped Mateen in a bathroom, Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters. That allowed many patrons to flee, although others were trapped in the restroom with Mateen, leading to a standoff. Police negotiated with Mateen for about three hours before breaking a hole in the wall, which allowed hostages to escape. Mateen also emerged from the hole and was shot dead by officers, police said. Some 53 people were wounded and 29 remain hospitalized at Orlando Regional Medical Center. Michael Cheatham, chief trauma surgeon at the hospital, told Fox News he expects all of the survivors in the hospital to survive.  Amanda Alvear‚Äôs last Snapchat video post began with a shot of her on the dance floor of the nightclub surrounded by friends. It ended with gunshots ringing out over the music. Alvear, 25, was identified by police as one of those killed at Pulse. Her friend Mercedez Flores, 26, who worked for Target,  was also on the list. Another victim was Edward Sotomayor, 34, a marketing manager at a Florida-based gay-themed travel company. He was a legend in the industry, his boss, Al Ferguson, said.  Pastor Deyni Ventura visited a survivor in the hospital, whom she identified only as Norman, who had taken refuge in a handicapped bathroom stall crammed with 30 people. Norman could hear the shooter laughing loudly as he sprayed gunfire over and under the bathroom stall. ‚ÄúThey couldn‚Äôt see the shooter but they could hear him laughing,‚Äù Ventura said, intimating a loud cackling laugh. Norman, who was shot four times, crawled over the bodies of his friends to safety. Everyone else in the stall died, Ventura said. Most of the people fatally shot were Latino, more than half of them of Puerto Rican origin and at least three of them Mexican citizens. Hundreds of people attended a vigil on Monday night for the dead in downtown Orlando.         Law enforcement officials searched for clues as to whether anyone had worked with Mateen on the attack, said Lee Bentley, the U.S. attorney for the middle district of Florida. But officials said they believed there had been no other attackers and had no evidence of a threat to the public. Mateen‚Äôs ex-wife, Sitora Yusifiy, described him as mentally unstable and violent toward her. ‚ÄúHe would get mad out of nowhere. That‚Äôs when I started worrying about my safety and then after a few months he started abusing me physically very often,‚Äù she told reporters. The couple split in 2009 after four months of marriage.     When Mateen met with his father the day before the killing, he betrayed nothing of the rage that would soon erupt. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice anything wrong,‚Äù Seddique Mateen said in an interview. ‚ÄúHe was very slick.‚Äù In the close-knit Muslim community of about 100 families in Fort Pierce, Florida, Mateen was known as quiet with few friends. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt a people person. He was not extremely friendly but he wasn‚Äôt rude either,‚Äù said Mohammed Jameel, 54, who worshipped at his mosque.     Mateen was an armed guard at a gated retirement community, and had worked for the global security firm G4S (GFS.L) for nine years..          He told the FBI during its investigation of him that he had made pro-Islamist remarks because he was angry at co-workers who he felt were discriminating against him and teasing him for being a Muslim, Comey said.

Cleveland sued over speech rights outside Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Three groups planning to demonstrate at the Republican National Convention in July sued the city of Cleveland on Tuesday, seeking immediate changes to security measures due to their ‚Äúunacceptable restrictions‚Äù on free speech. Presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to officially become the Republican Party‚Äôs candidate for president at the July 18-21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside. Trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations, some of which have resulted in clashes between the candidate‚Äôs supporters and opponents. Led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the three groups filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, naming the city of Cleveland and Mayor Frank Jackson as defendants. Dan Williams, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a phone call he had not seen the lawsuit and that the city does not comment on ongoing litigation. He said the city and the ACLU have discussed protester rights and regulations in meetings.     The plaintiffs are Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the businessman‚Äôs campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization. The lawsuit contends that Cleveland has imposed an unnecessarily large restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) in the city center where free speech and mobility will be limited. ‚ÄúThe limitations apply far beyond the part of the city where the convention activities will take place. ... These regulations severely limit the opportunities for members of the public to exercise their expressive rights during the convention,‚Äù the lawsuit said. The lawsuit seeks to reduce the size and regulations of the restricted an area and asks the court to immediately address the city‚Äôs rules for issuing protest permits and what the ACLU called persistent delays in approving those permits.  ‚ÄúMany of these applications have been pending for months - some as long as four months. The city‚Äôs continuing refusal to approve or deny these applications leaves the organizers of these activities in limbo,‚Äù the lawsuit said. Protesters need adequate time to make travel arrangements and rent needed materials such as portable toilets and sound stage equipment, the ACLU has said. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 "
Trump to meet with House Republicans on July 7,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump will speak with House of Representatives Republicans on July 7 in what would be the first meeting of the party‚Äôs presumptive presidential nominee with its entire House caucus, Republican aides said on Tuesday.

Some House Republicans have publicly criticized Trump‚Äôs inflammatory comments about Muslims, immigrants and women, saying they risked the party‚Äôs chances of winning the Nov. 8 election. Speaker Paul Ryan, who has endorsed the real estate mogul, this month denounced the candidate‚Äôs criticism of a Mexican-American judge as textbook racism.

Gunman in U.S. massacre described as 'quiet' but grew hateful,"FORT PIERCE, Fla. (Reuters) - The photo from Omar Mateen‚Äôs high school yearbook is hardly remarkable - a toothy, dimpled smile with a peach-fuzz mustache below a mop of black hair.  His transformation from high school football player to perpetrator of America‚Äôs worst mass shooting raises questions about whether red flags were missed over the depth of his apparent sympathies with Muslim extremists. As families of the victims grieved and the nation recoiled at the scale of yet another mass shooting, a picture began to emerge of the 29-year-old killer as a quiet, devout person who in recent years displayed a hateful and violent streak. Early on Sunday, he stormed a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, with a handgun and AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, fatally shooting 50 people before police killed him. Fifty-three others were wounded, many critically. His ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, described him as ‚Äúbipolar,‚Äù and emotionally disturbed with a violent temper. She said she had been beaten and otherwise physically abused by Mateen during outbursts in which he would ‚Äúexpress hatred towards everything‚Äù. She was ‚Äúrescued‚Äù by family members just four months into a stormy marriage that began in 2009 and ended in divorce, she said. ‚ÄúHe would often get into fights with his parents, but as I was the only one in his life most of the violence was directed towards me,‚Äù she told reporters in Boulder, Colorado outside a home where she was staying.  She said he aspired to be a police officer and had worked as a correctional officer at a detention center for juvenile delinquents in Fort Pierce, Florida, and had once sought admission to a police academy. In Fort Pierce on Florida‚Äôs southeast coast, 120 miles (195 km) from the shooting, the imam at the mosque that Mateen attended for nearly 10 years described him as a regular worshipper who was quiet and rarely interacted with the congregation. ‚ÄúHe hardly had any friends,‚Äù Syed Shafeeq Rahman, who heads the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, told Reuters. ‚ÄúHe would come with his little son at night to pray and after he would leave.‚Äù Rahman said Mateen never approached him regarding any concerns about homosexuals. He usually prayed at the mosque a few times a week, mostly in evenings and as recently as Friday, but he didn‚Äôt display signs of radicalism, according to fellow worshippers interviewed by Reuters. Mateen was born in New York of Afghan descent but spent most of his life in Florida, attending Martin County High School in Stuart, a small city about a 20-minute drive from the Fort Pierce condominium where had most recently lived. A classmate described him as a typical teen who played football. A school yearbook image of Mateen was seen by Reuters.   Samuel King, who was one year ahead of Mateen, said the two often spoke after Mateen graduated in 2004. King waited tables at Ruby Tuesday‚Äôs restaurant at Treasure Coast Square, a mall where Mateen worked at GNC, the nutrition store, he said. King, who is openly gay, said the Mateen he knew until 2009 did not appear to be anti-homosexual. ‚ÄúWhat is shocking to me is that the majority of the staff at Ruby Tuesday‚Äôs when I worked there were gay. He clearly was not anti-(gay) at least not back then. He did not show any hatred to any of us.‚Äù While at GNC, Mateen lifted weights and ‚Äúgot really buff,‚Äù King said, describing Mateen as gregarious and talkative in the immediate years after high school. ‚ÄúSomething must have changed‚Äù since he last saw him, he added. Mateen‚Äôs father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News the massacre was not related to¬†religion. He said his son turned angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago.  The FBI twice interviewed Mateen for having suspected ties to Islamist militants. The first investigation took place in 2013 when Mateen made inflammatory comments to co-workers that indicated sympathy for militants, FBI special agent in charge Ron Hopper told a news conference in Orlando. At the time, Mateen worked as a security guard at G4S, a British-owned multinational company that is among the world‚Äôs largest private security firms.  He joined G4S in September 2007, carried a gun as part of his duties and was employed with the company at the time of the shooting as an armed security officer, the company said.  G4S provides security to federal buildings in Florida. Mateen was investigated and interviewed twice but the FBI was ‚Äúunable to verify the substance of his comments,‚Äù Hopper said. Daniel Kime, a security guard employed along with Mateen by at G4S in the Fort Pierce area, said he met Mateen briefly three or four times. ‚ÄúEvery time I saw him he never smiled. If you said good morning, he‚Äôd just walk right by you, like he had a chip on his shoulder,‚Äù Kime told Reuters. Daniel Gilroy, who said he was a co-worker of Mateen‚Äôs at G4S, said that Mateen‚Äôs anger was ‚Äúconstant.‚Äù ‚ÄúAny time a female or a black person would come by he would use horrible words,‚Äù he told Fox News.  In 2014, Hopper said, Mateen was investigated and interviewed again, this time for suspected connections to Moner Mohammad¬†Abu-Salha, an American citizen who became a suicide bomber in Syria in 2014. Hopper said Mateen‚Äôs contact with Abu-Salha was minimal and it was deemed that ‚Äúhe did not constitute a substantive threat at that time.‚Äù Hopper said Mateen was not under investigation or surveillance at the time of Sunday‚Äôs attack. He said Mateen called during the massacre to pledge allegiance to Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which in recent years declared a caliphate over large swathes of Iraq and Syria. But the depth of that commitment is unclear. Mateen also mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers during the call, which he made 20 minutes into the shootings, authorities said. Mateen‚Äôs former wife said she met Mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida to marry him, according to the Washington Post. ‚ÄúHe was not a stable person,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn‚Äôt finished or something like that.‚Äù Mateen had a Florida firearms license that expired in 2013 and a state permit to work as a security guard, according to public records. He was registered as a Democrat. City, state and federal officials were searching Mateen‚Äôs apartment in the Woodlands condominium building in Fort Pierce and had told other residents to evacuate.

"Democrats link guns to terrorism, turn to gun control after Orlando","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama lamented the ease with which extremists can get firearms in the United States as ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and Hillary Clinton said ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù were using assault weapons to kill Americans, as Democrats on Monday renewed an uphill push for gun control after the Orlando massacre. The worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, in which 49 people at a gay nightclub were killed and 53 wounded, reignited a debate in Washington over what types of guns should not be easily available and what types of buyers ought to be prohibited. The No. 3 Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, and other Democrats said they would try as early as this week to get votes on a measure preventing people on ‚Äúterror watch lists‚Äù and other ‚Äúsuspected terrorists‚Äù from buying firearms or explosives. Senate Democrats are trying to resurrect a proposal that failed to win backing in December, after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by Islamic State-inspired militants. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, asked by a reporter whether he expected Republicans to oppose the legislation again, said: ‚ÄúExcept (Senator Mark) Kirk ... one out of 54 I guess is better than nothing.‚Äù Kirk was the lone Republican who voted last December with Democrats.        FBI Director James Comey said the gunman in the Florida attack, New York-born Omar Mateen, had been on a terrorism watch list while he was under FBI investigation for about a year ending in May 2014, but he was taken off when investigators found no incriminating information. The weapons Mateen brought into the packed Orlando club were purchased earlier this month. Speaking to reporters one day after the mass shooting, Obama said the United States was ‚Äúgoing to have to make sure that we think about the risks we are willing to take by being so lax in how we make very powerful firearms available to people in this country.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe¬†fact that we make it this challenging for law enforcement ... is crazy,‚Äù the Democratic president said. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, weighed in during a campaign rally in Cleveland.  ‚ÄúIf the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked,‚Äù she said to applause. In a MSNBC interview earlier, she said: ‚ÄúNow that we‚Äôre seeing terrorists use these assault weapons, that has to be part of the debate.‚Äù Rapid-firing ‚Äúassault‚Äù weapons were used by gunmen in shootings over the past year in Orlando, Florida, San Bernardino, California, and Garland, Texas. Efforts in Congress to curb weapons proliferation have gained some steam following past mass shootings, only to die amid opposition from the National Rifle Association gun lobby. An NRA spokesman did not immediately comment on Monday on the renewed calls for gun curbs. The December 2013 killings of 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school prompted a push for expanded background checks on gun sellers and banning assault weapons. The initiative collapsed in April 2014, when the legislation failed to get enough votes in the U.S. Senate to clear a procedural hurdle. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump used Sunday‚Äôs shooting as an example of why Americans needed guns, and charged that Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election, wanted to leave ‚Äúonly the bad guys and terrorists with guns.‚Äù Trump declared in a speech in Manchester, New Hampshire, that he would be meeting with the NRA, which has endorsed him, ‚Äúto discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.‚Äù Mateen, who was shot and killed by police who stormed the club, had been investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for saying he supported two Islamist groups, a statement he later said he made only to disturb his co-workers. He was questioned again in July 2014 for his connection to an American suicide bomber for al-Nusra, an al Qaeda offshoot, but the inquiry was dropped after the FBI found only a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù relationship between the two men.  U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said additional gun curbs would restrict Americans‚Äô freedoms without necessarily preventing attacks.  ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt commit this terrorist act for a couple years,‚Äù after being taken off the watch list, Johnson said on CNN. ‚ÄúThe enormous challenge we have, the vexing problem is, what do you do with the not-guilty-yet?‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 "

Ex-California lawmaker to plead guilty in corruption case: prosecutors,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A former California state senator accused of taking cash bribes and gifts from a businessman and from undercover FBI agents posing as Hollywood filmmakers to steer legislation in their favor has agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud, federal prosecutors said on Monday. Ronald Calderon, 58, a Democrat indicted in February 2014 on two dozen counts of bribery, fraud, money laundering and other charges, will enter his guilty plea this week, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office in Los Angeles said. According to the plea agreement, prosecutors have agreed not to ask for a sentence of more than 70 months, although the statutory maximum for the charge is 20 years. Calderon‚Äôs attorney, Mark Geragos, could not be reached for comment.  The former lawmaker‚Äôs brother, former state Assemblyman Thomas Calderon, pleaded guilty last week to a federal money-laundering charge in connection with the case. The Calderon brothers were members of a political dynasty going back several decades in California before they were ensnared in the federal investigation. ‚ÄúThe Calderons have acknowledged their roles in a bribery scheme in which money for them and their families alone was driving legislation that would have benefited only a few individuals,‚Äù U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said.  The 2014 indictment accused Ronald Calderon of taking bribes from California hospital owner Michael Drobot to preserve a legislative loophole that allowed Drobot to defraud the state‚Äôs healthcare system out of hundreds of millions of dollars. According to the plea agreement, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Monday, Drobot hired Calderon‚Äôs son while he was in college, paying him some $30,000 for three summers of work. Drobot has agreed to plead guilty to separate federal charges and is cooperating in the case, prosecutors have said. Calderon was also charged with accepting money from undercover FBI agents, who he thought worked for an independent Hollywood movie studio, in exchange for supporting an expansion of film tax credits in California. According to the plea agreement, Calderon had the undercover agent hire his daughter for $3,000 a month, make a $5,000 payment toward his son‚Äôs  tuition, pay for $12,000 in Las Vegas trips and give $25,000 to a nonprofit group the lawmaker and his brother used to pay themselves.

House panel to consider measure censuring IRS chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-controlled oversight committee in the U.S. House of Representatives announced on Monday that it will consider a measure censuring the head of the Internal Revenue Service on allegations related to scrutiny of conservative groups. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who is already facing a Republican-led impeachment effort, would be condemned for conduct inconsistent with ‚Äútrust and confidence‚Äù under a measure due to come before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday. Republicans, including the committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz of Utah, allege that Koskinen failed to comply with a House subpoena as lawmakers sought evidence that the agency targeted Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny. IRS actions came to light in early 2013, months before Koskinen arrived at the agency.  IRS officials had no immediate comment. Koskinen has denied any wrongdoing. Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the oversight committee‚Äôs top Democrat, accused Republicans of leap-frogging over the House Judiciary Committee, which is holding its own hearings to determine whether Koskinen committed any wrongdoing. Cummings said government investigators have found no evidence that the IRS targeted conservative groups or that Koskinen obstructed the House investigation. The proposed censure legislation urges Koskinen‚Äôs removal from office and would require him to forfeit his pension and other federal benefits. Committee approval would send it to the floor for a vote by the full House.  Legal experts say a congressional censure would not pass constitutional muster if it imposed any penalty.

Florida nightclub massacre prompts Rubio to reconsider political future,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who announced his retirement from the Senate after ending his Republican presidential bid in March, said on Monday he would reconsider his future after being urged to seek re-election in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub massacre.   The Florida Republican told radio host Hugh Hewitt in an interview that the worst mass shooting in U.S. history ‚Äúmost certainly has impacted my thinking in general, at least, about a lot of things.‚Äù But Rubio said he has not considered the rampage from a political perspective. ‚ÄúWhen it visits your home state, when it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country,‚Äù Rubio said. ‚ÄúMy family and I will be praying about all this and we‚Äôll see what I need to do next with my life in regards to how I can best serve.‚Äù   Hewitt urged Rubio to remain in the Senate, describing the lawmaker who sits on the Senate intelligence and foreign relations committees as one of the ‚Äúvery few people‚Äù who know the security issues raised by Sunday‚Äôs rampage. News of the interview brought an attack on Rubio‚Äôs voting record from Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who referred to the Republican repeatedly as ‚Äúthe junior senator‚Äù from Florida.  ‚ÄúHow can he speak of running for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy assault weapons and explosives?‚Äù Reid asked on the floor of the Senate. ‚ÄúThat is how he voted. The junior senator voted against every gun safety measure.‚Äù Rubio, who is also seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for Republican Donald Trump, announced that he would retire from the Senate and take a break from politics after losing Florida‚Äôs presidential primary in March to Trump. Before Sunday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others had urged him to seek re-election, citing polling data that showed he would win re-election and help Republicans retain their Senate majority. Rubio has backed his friend and fellow Republican, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera, in Florida‚Äôs August primary contest for his Senate seat.    If he were to run for re-election, Rubio would have to decide by a June 24 filing deadline. ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 "
Senate Democrats push for new gun control measures,"(Reuters) - Leading U.S. Senate Democrats on Monday urged quick passage of legislation defeated last year to impose additional gun controls in the wake of the weekend mass shooting in Florida. Four Democratic senators, led by Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, called for immediate passage of a bill preventing people on ‚Äúterror watch lists‚Äù and other ‚Äúsuspected terrorists‚Äù from buying firearms or explosives. Last December, Democrats attempted to pass this legislation but were blocked by Republicans, who said the government could mistakenly place innocent people on watch lists. The new push for legislation came after a man with an assault rifle entered a gay nightclub in Orlando and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others. The gunman subsequently was killed by law enforcement officers. Federal agents had interviewed the gunman twice in recent years. Joining Schumer in calling for passage of the legislation are Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, Bill Nelson of Florida and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Meanwhile, Democratic President Barack Obama on Monday blamed weak gun laws for allowing disturbed individuals to gain access to powerful weapons. Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic candidate to replace Obama in the White House, said people on watch lists should be barred from buying guns and said there should be a debate about possible restrictions on assault weapons. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, took a different approach, repeating his call for temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country.

U.S. court skeptical of lawmaker immunity in trading probe,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court fired skeptical questions on Monday at a lawyer for a U.S. congressional committee and a former staffer who argued that Congress is immune from having to cooperate with an insider-trading investigation. During a hearing, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to lean in favor of forcing Congress to comply at least somewhat with two subpoenas from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The case is a test of how far securities enforcers may go to police the murky world of ‚Äúpolitical intelligence,‚Äù in which firms seek to gather and sell information for traders.  The SEC is investigating trading in Humana Inc stock in 2013 ahead of a government announcement about physician reimbursement rates, which affect Humana and other health insurers. In court papers, the SEC said it believes a congressional staff member at the time, Brian Sutter, ‚Äúmay have been a source‚Äù of an early leak to a lobbyist at the Greenberg Traurig law firm, who then passed the information to a Height Securities analyst, who in turn alerted clients. Lawmakers and their staff are not immune from prosecution under insider-trading laws.  But Sutter and his former employer, the U.S. House of Representatives‚Äô Ways and Means Committee, refused to comply with subpoenas for documents and testimony. Their lawyers argued that they should be shielded from such investigative tactics because, under the legal principles of sovereign immunity and legislative independence, they cannot be questioned without their consent.  Circuit Judge Richard Wesley asked if Sutter went beyond protected activity in talking to the lobbyist. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what his job was at the Ways and Means Committee; he wasn‚Äôt in charge of insider trading,‚Äù he said. William Pittard, a lawyer for Sutter and the committee, said it was not the court‚Äôs role to question the motives of congressional staff. SEC lawyer Jeffrey Berger told the court that a ban on insider trading by Congress would be an ‚Äúempty shell‚Äù if the regulator lacked the power to investigate. The appeals court is expected to rule in the next several months. A Humana spokesman could not be reached for comment. A Greenberg Traurig spokeswoman declined to comment. Height Securities said in a statement it has not received a subpoena from or been formally investigated by the SEC. ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 "
Trump fights release of video testimony in fraud case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday filed court papers opposing the release of video showing him being questioned under oath about his Trump University series of real estate seminars. They argued that making public the videos, for which written transcripts are already available, would prejudice Trump‚Äôs case. The video is ‚Äúunnecessary, irrelevant and unjustified,‚Äù lawyers for Trump wrote in court papers filed in federal court in San Diego. In legal proceedings, evidence is considered prejudicial if it may interfere with a judge or jury‚Äôs objective consideration of the facts. Such evidence can still be presented if it is considered highly relevant to the case.  The Republican candidate has already claimed the federal judge overseeing the case is biased against him because of the judge‚Äôs Mexican heritage. Trump may also have concerns about the impact the videos could have outside the courtroom. On Friday, CNN, CBS, the New York Times, and other media outlets asked for the complete deposition transcripts and videotapes to be made available. If released, the videos could provide fodder for campaign commercials against Trump. In lawsuits in California and New York, Trump has been accused of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 for an opportunity to learn the businessman‚Äôs real estate investment strategies. Former Trump University students suing the billionaire claim that they learned little and that their instructors, supposedly hand-picked by Trump, had few qualifications.  During deposition, Trump has admitted that he did not select instructors. His lawyers have argued the ‚Äúhand-picked‚Äù claim amounted to mere sales ‚Äúpuffery‚Äù rather than fraud. In court papers arguing for the videos‚Äô release, lawyers for the students argued the images presented nuances not available in the transcripts. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs tone, facial expressions, gestures and body language... speak volumes to... Trump‚Äôs complete and utter unfamiliarity with the instructors and ‚Äòinstruction‚Äô that student-victims received,‚Äù they said. Trump has said the claims over Trump University are baseless and that students highly rated the programs.  The case is Art Cohen v Donald J.

Police reveal names of Orlando club shooting victims,"Orlando, Fla. (Reuters) - A day before the Orlando, Florida, nightclub massacre, Luis Vielma, 22, updated his Facebook profile with a picture of himself standing with young people in front of a Disney castle and a caption that read: ‚ÄúTrue friends who become family.‚Äù By Sunday night, his profile was altered to ‚ÄúRemember Luis Vielma‚Äù after police confirmed he was among 50 people killed in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. As authorities frantically tried to notify all the relatives, the Orlando Police Department began publishing the names of victims on a city website on Sunday afternoon. Among them was Vielma, who worked part-time as a rides attendant at the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey theme park ride, while studying physical therapy at Seminole State College, according to his Facebook profile.      Others included Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34, Stanley Almodovar III, 23, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, 20, Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22, Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36, and Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz, 22.  Police killed the gunman, who was identified as Omar Mateen, 29, a New York-born Florida resident and U.S. citizen who was the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, and officials were probing evidence suggesting the attack may have been inspired by Islamic State militants. The sheer number of deaths appeared to overwhelm officials in Orlando, a city of 270,000 people. Orlando police asked mourners to hold off on vigils as they were understaffed to police them.  ‚ÄúWe understand our community is grieving and that vigils are being planned but PLEASE hold off on vigils ‚Äì they represent a serious strain on our limited resources, which we need to dedicate to law enforcement and victims,‚Äù the city posted on its official Twitter handle. Sotomayor was a marketing manager at a Sarasota, Florida-based gay-themed travel company. His boss, Al Ferguson, said Sotomayor‚Äôs partner was outside the nightclub putting something in the car when the shots rang out. He got a text from Sotomayor telling him he was safe in the bathroom and not to come back into the club. Sotomayor texted again 20 minutes later to say he was OK. That was the last his partner heard from him, Ferguson said.     Sotomayor was a legend in the industry, Ferguson said. He booked tours for entertainer and drag queen RuPaul and put together the first gay cruise to Cuba last year. He was going to announce a second trip on Sunday, but was killed. ‚ÄúAnyone who booked gay cruises knew Sotomayor,‚Äù Ferguson told Reuters. ‚ÄúHe was a great man.‚Äù  In an Instagram post published on Sunday, RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race judge Michelle Visage called Sotomayor ‚Äúa joy.‚Äù ‚ÄúI loved you on so many levels.

Exclusive: Obama administration not pursuing executive order to shut Guantanamo - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration is not pursuing the use of an executive order to shutter the Guantanamo Bay military prison after officials concluded that it would not be a viable strategy, sources familiar with the deliberations said. The conclusion, reached by administration officials, narrows the already slim chances that President Barack Obama can fulfill his pledge to close the  notorious offshore prison before leaving office in January. The White House has said repeatedly that Obama has not ruled out any options on the Guantanamo center, which has been used to house terrorism suspects since it was set up in 2001 following the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Obama is eager to fulfill his 2008 campaign pledge to close the prison and could still choose to use his commander-in-chief powers, but the option is not being actively pursued, the sources said. Without executive action, the chances of closing the prison would hinge on convincing a resistant Congress to overturn a long-standing ban on bringing possibly dozens of remaining prisoners to maximum-security prisons in the United States.  White House lawyers and other officials studied the option of overriding the ban but did not develop a strong legal position or an effective political sales pitch in an election year, a source familiar with the discussions said.  ‚ÄúIt was just deemed too difficult to get through all of the hurdles that they would need to get through, and the level of support they were likely to receive on it was thought to be too low to generate such controversy, particularly at a sensitive (time) in an election cycle,‚Äù the source said. Republicans in Congress are opposed to bringing Guantanamo detainees to U.S. prisons and have expressed opposition to transfers to other countries over concern that released prisoners will return to militant activities. They have vowed to challenge any potential Obama executive action in court. At its peak, the prison at the U.S. naval base in Cuba housed nearly 800 prisoners, becoming a symbol of the excesses of the ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù and synonymous with criticism of detention without trial and accusations of torture. Obama has called it a recruitment tool for terrorists. The number of Guantanamo detainees has fallen to 80 now, the lowest since it was opened.  The administration is focusing on getting the number of detainees at the prison down to such a low number, perhaps 20, that the cost of keeping it open could prove unpalatable to Congress. Republican lawmakers remain unswayed. The Guantanamo prison and associated military commissions cost $445 million in fiscal year 2015. That works out to more than $5.5 million a year for each of the 80 remaining prisoners. Thirty of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo have been approved for transfer to foreign countries and the State Department says it will move all of them out this summer. Those who would be left include 10 being prosecuted in military commissions, and other detainees deemed too dangerous to release or transfer. ‚ÄúThe administration‚Äôs goal is to work with Congress to find a solution to close Guantanamo,‚Äù said Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council. He said the government had made ‚Äúsubstantial progress‚Äù  moving prisoners to foreign countries and was working to identify more countries for additional transfers. Reviews to determine whether certain prisoners need to remain detained to prevent a threat to U.S. security had been accelerated and would be completed in the coming months, he said. Obama, who issued an order to shut the prison within a year on his first day in office, released his latest plan to close it to Congress in February, but it has not gained traction. The White House has not publicly ruled out the executive order option in part to keep pressure on the Pentagon to move prisoners who have been cleared for release to other countries, one of the sources said. ‚ÄúIf Congress ... would finally say no to the president‚Äôs plan and the executive order option wasn‚Äôt on the table, there was a concern that the wheels could grind to a halt,‚Äù said the source familiar with discussions at the White House. Gregory Craig, who served as Obama‚Äôs first White House counsel, said that without an executive order, Obama would likely need the cooperation of Congress to shut down the prison. ‚ÄúI think the odds are probably challenging,‚Äù Craig said.

"Abortion providers, opponents brace for U.S. high court decision","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As she waits for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law, Amy Hagstrom-Miller said she hopes she will not have to close up to three of the clinics she operates in the state, but is planning for it just in case. ¬†¬†¬† Hagstrom-Miller founded Whole Woman‚Äôs Health, which runs four facilities in Texas that provide abortions and led the legal challenge to the law. She said she has spreadsheets listing staffers who would be laid off if the court allows the law to survive, and is thinking about selling buildings and medical equipment as well as shutting her clinics in Fort Worth, San Antonio and McAllen. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúI would be irresponsible if I didn‚Äôt plan,‚Äù Hagstrom-Miller said in an interview. The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June on whether the Texas law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to end her pregnancy as set out in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The court has not issued a major abortion-related ruling since 2007. ¬†¬†¬† The law requires abortion doctors to have ‚Äúadmitting privileges,‚Äù a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. That provision has been implemented. A second provision, not yet in effect, requires clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities including extensive standards for such attributes as corridor width, room size, floor tiles and the swinging motion of doors. Supporters of the law, passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013, say it was enacted to protect women‚Äôs health. ¬†¬†¬† Abortion rights advocates say it imposes medically unnecessary regulations intended to shut clinics and has dramatically reduced access to abortion in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people. Getting a clear-cut ruling is complicated by the fact that the court is down to eight justices, split evenly with four conservatives and four liberals, following the February death of conservative Antonin Scalia. One possibility is a 4-4 split that would affirm a lower court‚Äôs decision upholding the law but would not set a national legal precedent that could guide other states eager to pass similar statutes. Because it is unlikely one of the court‚Äôs liberals would join the four conservatives, there is almost no chance of a  broad ruling upholding the law and giving other states a green light to enact similar measures. Numerous Republican-governed states have considered measures that would restrict abortion availability. For abortion opponents, who no longer have Scalia to cast a fifth vote to tip the balance in their favor, a 4-4 split leaving the Texas law in place may be the best result possible. John Eastman, a professor at Chapman University School of Law in California, an abortion opponent who filed a brief with the high court backing the Texas law, said if the justices cannot deliver a decisive ruling, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a catastrophe.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have women‚Äôs health and safety in some parts of the country than no parts of the country,‚Äù Eastman said. Legal fights over similar laws are ongoing in several states, including Mississippi, Louisiana and Wisconsin. ¬†¬†¬† If the court leaves in place the lower-court ruling upholding the Texas law, the number of abortion clinics in the state would drop from the current 19 to nine, abortion providers said. Texas had 41 abortion clinics when the law was passed. ¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúA 4-4 decision would leave us in the untenable situation where a woman‚Äôs ability to get an abortion will depend on where she lives,‚Äù said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes restrictive abortion laws.  ¬†¬†¬† Another possibility is that the justices strike down the law, or invalidate one of the two provisions at issue while keeping the other. It may be more likely that the admitting-privileges provision, already in effect, would survive, while the hospital-grade facilities requirements, which the justices themselves temporarily blocked, would not. Justice Anthony Kennedy could be the key player in any such scenarios, which would require at least one conservative to join the four liberals. Kennedy is a conservative who in past rulings has endorsed Roe v. Wade, but has voted to uphold some abortion restrictions. ‚ÄúIt comes down to Justice Kennedy, and during the argument he didn‚Äôt show his hand too much,‚Äù said John Seago, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life‚Äôs legislative director, adding that the ruling could give abortion opponents ‚Äúideas about what laws we could pass.‚Äù Another possibility is that the court returns the case to a lower court for further proceedings, as Kennedy suggested during March 2 oral arguments. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs overwhelming for me when I think what could happen if it‚Äôs not a favorable decision,‚Äù said Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who performs abortions at two Texas Whole Woman‚Äôs Health clinics. ‚ÄúI try not to think about it every minute of every day.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 "
Obama calls Orlando nightclub shooting an attack on all Americans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Sunday described the worst mass shooting in U.S. history as ‚Äúan act of terror‚Äù and ‚Äúan act of hate,‚Äù saying the massacre of 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida was an attack on all Americans. ‚ÄúToday as Americans we grieve the brutal murder, a horrific massacre of dozens of innocent people,‚Äù he said in a statement at the White House.  ‚ÄúAlthough it is still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWe will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united as Americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.‚Äù He ordered the flag at the White House to be flown at half staff to honor the victims.  The shooter, who was identified as Florida resident Omar S. Mateen was killed by police at the nightclub. A top U.S. congressman said Mateen may have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State militant group, but U.S. officials cautioned they had no direct evidence of a connection.   Fifty-three people were wounded in the rampage, which surpassed the 32 people killed in the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech university. Obama said it was appropriate for the FBI to investigate the massacre as an act of terrorism and said he would ‚Äúspare no effort‚Äù to determine whether the assailant had been inspired or associated with an extremist group. The president also termed the shooting a new reminder of ‚Äúhow easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub,‚Äù a reference to other mass killings that have punctuated recent U.S. history.  ‚ÄúWe have to decide if that‚Äôs¬†the kind of country we want to be,‚Äù he said.

Trump says Florida massacre proves he's right on Islamist threat,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gave an aggressive response to the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, quickly claiming the attack was the work of an Islamist militant while calling on President Barack Obama to resign and  for Democrat Hillary Clinton to exit the presidential race. For Trump, it was an attempt to frame the attack in Orlando in a light favorable to his campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Early on Sunday, when few facts were known about the shooting, he boasted on Twitter that it proved he had been right about his warnings over ‚Äúradical Islamic terrorism.‚Äù Trump canceled a planned Monday evening rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire late on Sunday, because of the shooting, but will go ahead with a major speech at St. Anselm‚Äôs College on Monday afternoon. In a tweet just hours after the incident, he wrote:  ‚ÄúAppreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don‚Äôt want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance.‚Äù  Trump has made combating the threat of groups such as Islamic State a central part of his candidacy.  It was last December‚Äôs attack in San Bernardino, California that killed 14 people that led Trump to propose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump re-visited the proposal on Sunday after at least 50 people died in the attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.   ‚ÄúWhat has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough,‚Äù Trump wrote on Twitter. In a statement late Sunday, the businessman went further than U.S. officials investigating the shootings by asserting that the attack in Orlando was the work of a ‚Äúradical Islamic terrorist.‚Äù Islamic State, which controls land in Iraq and Syria,  claimed responsibility for the shooting but U.S. officials said they had seen no immediate evidence directly linking the militant group to the massacre. The shooter, U.S.-born Florida resident Omar Mateen, was killed by police. Mateen, 29, called 911 on Sunday morning and made comments saying he supported the Islamic State militant group, officials said.  A Trump supporter played Trump‚Äôs speeches on a loudspeaker outside the Port St. Lucie, Florida home of Mateen‚Äôs parent‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Cuban citizen and I‚Äôm becoming an American citizen on July 6 and I‚Äôm going to vote for the first time in my life for Donald Trump,‚Äù said Arisley Travieso, 36, who works for a shredding company. Traveiso said he supported Trump because the Republican nominee sees ‚Äúthe problem is Islamic terrorism. He (Trump) has been saying it nonstop.‚Äù     Trump ripped Obama for his long-standing refusal to refer to Islamic State and other extremist groups as in part representative of the religion of Islam. ‚ÄúIn his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words ‚ÄòRadical Islam‚Äô. For that reason alone, he should step down,‚Äù Trump said, adding that, ‚Äúif Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words ‚ÄòRadical Islam‚Äô she should get out of this race for the presidency.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs day-long barrage of tweets and statements contrasted  with more cautious approaches taken by Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and her fellow Democrat Obama.     In remarks at the White House, Obama said the investigation into the shootings was ongoing and declined to speculate on the motives of the shooter.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThe FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism.   Similarly, Clinton, in a statement, called the attack an ‚Äúact of terror‚Äù but did not speculate about the ideology of the gunman. ‚ÄúLaw enforcement and intelligence agencies are hard at work, and we will learn more in the hours and days ahead,‚Äù said Clinton, who expressed her sympathy for the victims and said ‚Äúweapons of war‚Äù have no place on U.S. streets.

"Some lawmakers talk gun control after Florida shooting, scant hope for change","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history prompted calls on Sunday by some members of Congress for legislation to tighten control of weapons sales, although there were slim hopes for much change after 50 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Florida. Democratic Senator Robert Casey said he would announce a bill on Monday that would ban anyone convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime from owning a firearm. Under current law, those with felony convictions are prohibited from buying or possessing a gun, but those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes are not.    Casey planned to make the announcement in his home state of Pennsylvania after a meeting with members of Pittsburgh‚Äôs lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Lawmakers, including some Republicans, have sought some gun restrictions after earlier mass shootings, but even minor changes failed to gain enough support to become law. Backed by the powerful gun lobby, many members of Congress see controls of weapons sales as a threat to Americans‚Äô constitutional rights. Other Democrats also called for Congress to act after Sunday‚Äôs attack in Orlando, some in strong terms. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said the killings would prompt debate but not action. ‚ÄúThe bottom line is that we allow dangerous people to buy guns in America and that has got to change,‚Äù he said. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said the ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù of gun violence would continue if Congress does not act and also said lawmakers shared responsibility. ‚ÄúCongress has become complicit in these murders by its total, unconscionable deafening silence,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt have to happen but this epidemic will continue without end if Congress continues to sit on its hands and do nothing ‚Äì again.‚Äù A gunman killed 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in Murphy‚Äôs home state, Connecticut, in 2012. The suspected Orlando attacker, identified as Omar Mateen, 29, a U.S. citizen who was the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, was carrying an AR-15 style assault rifle and a handgun, authorities said. The shooter in Newtown also had an AR-15. Many Republicans, including the presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, focused on the threat from Islamist militants after the shooting, citing reports that Mateen was inspired by Islamic State. The FBI said Mateen had twice been interviewed after making comments to co-workers indicating he supported militant groups, but neither led to evidence of criminal activity.

Assault rifle used in Florida shooting drives gun control debate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Omar Mateen entered an Orlando, Florida, nightclub on Sunday to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, he wielded a weapon that has been used in massacres from California to Connecticut: a military-inspired semi-automatic rifle. Though so-called assault rifles account for a small fraction of the United States‚Äô 30,000 annual gun deaths, they have been used in at least 10 mass shootings since 2011, according to a database compiled by Mother Jones magazine. The prevalence of these firearms has made them a focal point in the debate over U.S. gun laws as opponents say civilians should not own what they describe as ‚Äúweapons of war.‚Äù Backers say they are simply modern rifles enjoyed by millions of law-abiding Americans. In December 2012, Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster XM15 to kill 28 children and adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut before taking his own life with a Glock pistol. Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook used two assault rifles and two pistols to kill 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015.  James Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun and two pistols when he killed 12 people in a Colorado movie theater in 2012. Law enforcement officials say Mateen, a 29-year-old U.S. citizen who was the son of Afghan immigrants, carried an AR-15 style assault rifle and a handgun when he killed 50 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando. He also had an unidentified device, said Orlando Police Chief John Mina. The AR-15 was developed from the U.S. military‚Äôs M-16 rifle, used in the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Unlike the military version, the AR-15 is not fully automatic, meaning users must pull the trigger each time they want to fire a shot. Like the military version, many AR-15s combine light weight with a relatively modest recoil. Prominent manufacturers include Smith & Wesson, Sturm Ruger and Remington Arms Co, which faces a lawsuit from some families of Sandy Hook victims who say the rifle should not be sold to civilians. ‚ÄúIt is the gold standard for killing the enemy in battle, just as it has become the gold standard for mass murder of innocent civilians,‚Äù said Josh Koskoff, a lawyer involved in the case.   The National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gun manufacturers, said it would not comment on the Orlando shooting until more facts are known.  The NSSF estimates there are roughly 5 million to 10 million AR-15 rifles owned in the United States, a fraction of the 300 million firearms owned by Americans. Most owners say they use the rifle for target shooting and home defense, although they can be used for hunting as well. Despite their controversial reputation, assault rifles do not often turn up at murder scenes. Handguns accounted for at least 48 percent of all murders between 2010 and 2014, according to FBI data, while rifles - a category that includes more traditional types of long guns - accounted for 2.4 percent. Roughly four times as many people were killed by knives in that period. Still, in the wake of the Orlando shooting several Democratic politicians said Congress should renew a ban on assault-style weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines that was in place between 1994 and 2004. ‚ÄúIt reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets,‚Äù said presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Research is mixed on whether the assault-rifle ban had a significant impact. Gun manufacturers were able to tweak their designs to get around the ban and crime rates have fallen steadily since the early 1990s, whether or not the ban was in place. The number of mass shootings has increased since it expired.  Any effort to renew the ban would face fierce opposition in the U.S. Congress, where Republicans who control both chambers of Congress have staunchly opposed tighter gun laws and groups like the National Rifle Association have been able to mobilize millions of gun owners against other restrictions. Despite strong support from President Barack Obama, the last attempt at new gun legislation failed in the U.S. Senate in 2013. Opinion polls find that Americans are less enthusiastic about banning assault weapons than other types of gun restrictions, such as expanded background checks. Several polls since 2013 have found between 44 percent and 57 percent of Americans back the idea. Six states and the District of Columbia currently ban assault weapons and two more, Minnesota and Virginia, ban possession by people under 18 years old. Experts say it is difficult to tell whether those laws have had an impact since gun buyers can easily find those weapons in other states. ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 "

Texas politician slammed for tweet sent after Florida shooting,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The office of Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a Republican and evangelical Christian, on Sunday deleted a tweet many saw as offensive and insensitive that was sent out shortly after the deadly attack on a gay nightclub in Florida. ‚ÄúDo not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows,‚Äù read the Bible verse Patrick sent out on his official Twitter account a few hours after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 50 dead. His office was not immediately available for comment but has told local media, including the Dallas Morning News, that the tweet had been scheduled for release well before the shooting. The office, which regularly sends out a Bible verse on Sundays, has since deleted it and replaced with another passage, they said.  But the deleted tweet from a politician who has condemned same-sex marriage and fought against LGBT rights still raised the ire of those who accused Patrick of blaming the victims. ‚ÄúYou are a disgrace to your state in this time of national sorrow. You should resign,‚Äù prominent LGBT activist George Takei wrote on Twitter. The Texas Democratic Party called on Patrick to apologize immediately. ‚ÄúMake this right. We are better than this,‚Äù it said in a statement. Patrick is currently out of the country and has not yet made  comment to media about the tweet.

Obama's remarks on Orlando shooting: 'We will not give in to fear',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Sunday said Americans would stand united and ‚Äúnot give in to fear or turn against each other‚Äù in the wake of a nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, that killed 50 people. Following is the full text of remarks, Obama delivered at the White House: Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder - a horrific massacre - of dozens of innocent people.¬†We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts.¬†We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city.¬†Although it‚Äôs still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people. I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisers. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. I‚Äôve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation. We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We‚Äôve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I‚Äôve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what - if any - inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we‚Äôll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us. This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need - they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come. We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm‚Äôs way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It‚Äôs the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough. This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends - our fellow Americans - who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub - it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights. So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American - regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation - is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans. Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that‚Äôs the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well. In the coming hours and days, we‚Äôll learn about the victims of this tragedy. Their names. Their faces. Who they were. The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families - that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable. And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more - as a country - by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us. As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts - friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us. May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love.¬†Thank you. ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 "

Democrats want 'major role' for Sanders: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders may have lost his bid to become the Democratic nominee for the White House, but party members don‚Äôt want the U.S. senator from Vermont to step off the stage. More than three-quarters of Democrats say Sanders should have a ‚Äúmajor role‚Äù in shaping the party‚Äôs positions, while nearly two thirds say Hillary Clinton - who beat him for the nomination - should pick him as her vice-presidential running mate, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. In a sign that Democrats hope their party can unite after a fierce primary season, two-thirds also said that Sanders should endorse Clinton, a former secretary of state and senator who appears bound for a showdown with Republican Donald Trump in November‚Äôs presidential election. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, managed to turn his long-shot run into a mass movement with hard-line proposals to combat wealth inequality, increase access to health care and education, and defend the environment. His challenge to Clinton, one of the best-known figures in American politics, lasted far longer than expected, as he racked up strong results in a number of state nominating contests and stayed in the race even when the delegate count seemed to spell his doom, and yielded record numbers of small donations to his campaign. Sanders so far has not conceded defeat, even though Clinton recently clinched the nomination and won endorsements from President Barack Obama and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - a favorite of the same left-leaning voters who supported him. Sanders has said he will continue to push for a liberal agenda heading into the Democratic National Convention in July - when Clinton‚Äôs nomination is expected to become official - though he has hinted he does not want his presence to hurt the Democrats‚Äô chances of keeping the White House.  ‚ÄúWe will not let Donald Trump become president,‚Äù Sanders told supporters last week. The poll, conducted June 7-10 - right after Clinton sewed up the delegate majority to become the presumptive Democratic nominee - showed that while most Democrats want Sanders to line up behind Clinton, about 44 percent would like him to make an independent run for the White House. Some 47 percent said he should not. The poll included 455 respondents and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 5.3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 "
"HP CEO Whitman compares Trump to Hitler, Mussolini","(Reuters) - Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co chief executive and Republican donor Meg Whitman reiterated her opposition to Donald Trump as the party‚Äôs presidential nominee and compared him to fascist leaders Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, according to media and two sources. Whitman made the comment Friday at a conference hosted by previous Republican nominee Mitt Romney, while she challenged U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan on his endorsement of Trump, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. Two participants at the off-the-record session in Park City, Utah confirmed Whitman‚Äôs language to Reuters. Whitman could not immediately be reached for comment.      A billionaire and former supporter of failed candidate New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Whitman has been actively working to stop Trump‚Äôs nomination, including fundraising for an anti-Trump Super PAC.  In February, the technology CEO called Trump ‚Äúunfit‚Äù to be president. Since then, Trump has become the presumptive Republican nominee and is likely to run against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. Ryan, addressing the 300 attendees of the session, explained the difficulty he had with the decision to endorse, the Post said, including weathering pressure from House Republicans to lend his backing to Trump.   After weeks of holding out, Ryan endorsed the New York businessman in early June, breaking with a number of establishment Republicans who see Trump‚Äôs rhetoric as damaging to the party. The opponents include Romney, Republicans‚Äô 2012 presidential nominee, who chose Ryan as his running mate. Romney has blasted Trump in recent weeks for attacks he has made on the Mexican-American judge presiding over a case against him, with Romney warning on Friday about the effect that ‚Äútrickle-down racism‚Äù could have on the country. As the presumptive nominee, Trump now has to balance maintaining the outsider style that helped propel him to the nomination, while courting Republican insiders, who could be critical to financing a general election campaign against a well-funded Clinton.  Trump on Saturday showed no inclination to make peace with his critics. He went on Twitter to note how Romney ‚Äúchoked like a dog‚Äù when he lost to then-incumbent President Barack Obama in 2012 and reiterated it at his campaign stops.  ",politicsNews,"June 11, 2016 "

"Appeals court ruling will let some Kansas voters register, for now","(Reuters) - Thousands of Kansas residents who signed up to vote at motor vehicle offices but were kept off the rolls by a state law requiring proof of citizenship could be allowed to cast ballots in the November general election, under a ruling on Friday by a U.S. appeals court. Kansas‚Äô secretary of state, Kris Kobach, a Republican who has become a national leader in pushing for voting changes, had asked the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to place on hold a decision last month by a lower-court judge ordering the state to begin registering 18,000 residents affected by the law. In requesting the stay, the state said the order to begin to register voters would ‚Äúresult in extraordinary confusion on November 8, 2016.‚Äù The Denver-based federal appeals court, however, rejected the argument. ‚ÄúWe conclude that defendant-appellant has not made the requisite showing for a stay pending appeal so we deny that motion,‚Äù a panel of the appeals court said in its ruling. The appeals court has not yet ruled on the merits of the case. It did not say when it expected it would make a decision, but it granted expedited review. The Kansas law will not affect the state‚Äôs status as a safe Republican stronghold in November‚Äôs presidential election, but it has thrust Kansas into a national debate over voting restrictions. Representatives for Kobach could not be reached for comment. The ruling comes in a lawsuit brought by Kansas residents who submitted voter applications through state motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of citizenship. Under a state law that took effect in 2013, they were required to present a document such as a birth certificate. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the plaintiffs, argued in their lawsuit that the statute conflicts with a federal law designed to make it easier to register to vote while getting a driver‚Äôs license.  U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson, in her May 17 ruling ordering Kansas to begin to register more than 18,000 applicants at Division of Motor Vehicle offices who were kept off the rolls, noted that Kansas could identify only three non-citizens who voted between 2003 and 2013. Under Robinson‚Äôs ruling, Kansas residents placed on the rolls can vote in federal but not state elections. Kansas will hold its primaries for state and local elections in August.

"Stung by criticism, Trump vows to work for ethnic harmony","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump offered a message of ethnic harmony on Friday at a Christian evangelical conference as he sought to calm concern about his criticism of a Mexican-American judge. In a departure from his usual freewheeling style, Trump read a carefully scripted speech from a teleprompter as part of a new push by his campaign to tone down the outspoken New Yorker‚Äôs harsh rhetoric. Trump‚Äôs remarks included a wide-ranging attack on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and he said money aimed at resettling Syrian refugees in the United States should instead be spent on tackling poverty in U.S. cities. Speaking to the annual conference of the conservative Faith & Freedom Coalition, Trump did not mention the controversy over his charge that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel cannot treat him fairly because of his Mexican heritage. But Trump did make a point of saying he would represent all Americans if elected president on Nov. 8. ‚ÄúFreedom of any kind means no one should be judged by their race or their color and the tone of his hue,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúRight now, we have a very divided nation. We‚Äôre going to bring our nation together.‚Äù Paul Ryan, the top elected U.S. Republican, had criticized Trump for what he called a ‚Äútextbook definition of a racist comment‚Äù for his remarks about the judge. Other Republican leaders warned Trump to change his tone or risk losing their support. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who  led a movement to derail Trump‚Äôs nomination, told CNN he would not consider running for the White House. Romney blasted Trump for comments that he said denigrated Mexicans, women and religion. ‚ÄúPresidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry and trickle-down misogyny - all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America,‚Äù he said. Romney said he expects Trump to get the Republican nomination, but said that he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. He left open the possibility of casting a ballot for the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. As Trump sought to rally more Republicans behind him, Clinton met with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to try and shore up support from the left wing of the Democratic Party. Clinton later addressed the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the nonpartisan arm of the women‚Äôs health group, and had Trump trained in her sights. ‚ÄúThis is a man who has called women pigs, dogs and disgusting animals, it‚Äôs kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights,‚Äù said Clinton, the first woman to become the presumptive presidential nominee of a major party.   Clinton leads Trump by 11 percentage points, nearly the same  as a week ago, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.       Trump on Friday criticized Clinton‚Äôs willingness to accept thousands of Syrian refugees into the United States and challenged her to ‚Äúreplace her support for increased refugee admission‚Äù in favor of a new jobs program for inner cities.     He stopped short of repeating his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, a proposal that has drawn heavy fire from Republicans and Democrats. ‚ÄúWe have to temporarily stop this whole thing with what‚Äôs going on with refugees where we don‚Äôt know where they‚Äôre coming from,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans so they can come out of this horrible situation that they‚Äôre in.‚Äù At the funeral on Friday of boxing champion Muhammad Ali, a convert to Islam, one speaker, a rabbi, inveighed against politicians promoting intolerance of Muslims.  ‚ÄúWe will not tolerate politicians or anyone else putting down Muslims and blaming Muslims for a few people,‚Äù said Rabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of Tikkun magazine, who said he attended the ceremony in Louisville, Kentucky, as a representative of American Jews. Trump said Clinton‚Äôs refusal to use the phrase ‚Äúradical Islamic terrorism‚Äù - favored by Republicans to describe violent Islamist militants - makes her unfit to be president. The real estate mogul‚Äôs struggle to unify Republicans behind his insurgent candidacy was apparent at the evangelical Faith & Freedom conference, where several speakers studiously avoided speaking his name. Former campaign rival Carly Fiorina steered clear of Trump, speaking instead of the need to prevent liberal policies taking hold.  U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, said a Republican president is needed, without mentioning Trump. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want this contest this fall to just be a contest of personalities,‚Äù she said. But conference organizer Ralph Reed was adamant in his support for Trump, saying the New Yorker has energized the evangelical vote in a way that past Republican presidential nominees failed to do. ‚ÄúWe understand that perfection is not the measure that should be applied,‚Äù Reed told the crowd.

"Puerto Rico GO bond price dips, rescue bill moves to Senate","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico‚Äôs benchmark General Obligation bond fell in price on Friday in choppy trading after the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation aimed at helping the U.S. territory fix its fiscal mess. The GO bond, carrying an 8 percent coupon and maturing in 2035, last traded at 64.74 points in price, pushing the yield to 13.05 percent from 12.73 percent on Thursday, according to data provided by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. According to the MSRB‚Äôs Electronic Municipal Market Access database, about $21 million worth of bonds traded versus $14 million the day before. Late on Thursday the House passed the ""Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act"" (PROMESA), by a vote of 297-127, with the U.S. Senate expected to take up the bill quickly ahead of a $1.9 billion debt payment due July 1. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5) Puerto Rico has a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay and a staggering 45 percent poverty rate. It faces steady migration of its residents to the mainland and a potential humanitarian crisis because it cannot sustain social services. PROMESA, if passed by the Senate and signed into law, would establish a powerful seven-member federal Oversight Board to navigate through the restructurings. Among other things, the board would have the authority to enforce balanced budgets. ‚ÄúIt is definitely a step forward, a very good step forward. We think it was necessary. It doesn‚Äôt answer all your questions but at least it sets up a framework and does provide fiscal management and oversight which we think was necessary because the credibility of the government is pretty much shot,‚Äù said Joe Rosenblum, director of municipal credit research at AllianceBernstein in New York. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think at these prices we are ready to dip our toes back in and we haven‚Äôt seen a lot of trading activity out there, so I think we are in company,‚Äù Rosenblum said. PROMESA does not set out specific rules for restructuring, leaving such decisions to the control board to work through with creditors. This is a critical point for municipal bond market investors where long-standing rules set out a hierarchy among creditors, typically with GO bondholders considered senior to all others. ‚ÄúRegardless of how things get restructured today, the fact that the economy continues to shrink and the population continues to shrink is a problem for the credit going forward,‚Äù said Craig Brandon, co-director of municipal investments at Eaton Vance in Boston.

House opposes carbon and oil taxes in symbolic votes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted largely along party lines on Friday to reject any new taxes on carbon emissions and oil production. The two non-binding actions were intended to get Republicans on the record opposing higher taxes on fossil fuels amid industry concerns that they could become part of a new tax reform debate in 2017, according to aides and lobbyists. One resolution opposing a carbon tax as detrimental to the U.S. economy, which was led by House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and backed by the privately owned Koch Industries Inc, drew support from 237 lawmakers, including 231 Republicans and six Democrats, while 163 Democrats voted against the measure. Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups favor a carbon tax as a way to control emissions. Republican leaders and their industry allies have worried that support for a carbon tax among big oil companies could encourage some Republicans to back such a measure.  A separate resolution against President Barack Obama‚Äôs proposed $10-a-barrel oil tax won support from 253 lawmakers, including 230 Republicans and 23 Democrats. One Republican and 143 Democrats voted against the measure. ‚ÄúThese taxes would harm businesses and hardworking American families who (are) already struggling with stagnant wages,‚Äù Representative Bill Flores, a Texas Republican and former energy industry executive, said in a statement.

Illinois governor vetoes $3.9 billion FY 2016 spending bill,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday vetoed a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature in April to spend nearly $3.9 billion on state services that have not been funded due to an ongoing fiscal 2016 budget impasse. The Republican governor called the legislation ‚Äúan empty promise.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe bill purports to appropriate $3.89 billion, including more than $3 billion in general funds that the state does not have, for higher education and social service providers, but provides no source of funding,‚Äù Rauner said in his veto message.  The political stalemate between Rauner and Democrats has left Illinois as the only U.S. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget, operating instead on court-ordered spending and a muddled patchwork of ongoing and stopgap appropriations. Rauner called on lawmakers to pass complete balanced budgets for the current and next fiscal years, although the governor has proposed funding most fiscal 2017 services with a temporary spending plan and K-12 schools with a full-year budget. Illinois‚Äô new fiscal year begins on July 1. The Democrats‚Äô spending bill passed with enough votes in the Senate to override a veto, but fell short of that margin in the House. The measure would have sent money to cash-starved state universities and colleges, covered tuition grants for low-income college students, and funded health and human services that were not subject to court orders. The measure also appropriated about $63 million for unpaid wage increases owed to about 24,000 unionized state workers.  ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 "
Congress eyes $1 billion to aid at-risk families,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Key members of the U.S. Congress said Friday they had reached a compromise to shift more than $1 billion to try to keep struggling families together, including those with babies born dependant on opioids. The proposal is driven in part by an opioid crisis that threatens thousands of families. The bill would allow mental health, substance abuse and parenting assistance whenever a child is deemed at ‚Äúimminent risk‚Äù of entering foster care. The measure also offers support for relatives who unexpectedly assume responsibility for a child when a parent cannot. Under current law, such funds may only be spent after a child enters foster care. A spokesman for the Child Welfare League of America, John Sciamanna, called the proposed change ‚Äúa landmark‚Ä¶, potentially historic.‚Äù The legislation involves more than $1 billion over 10 years. Related opioid bills have not included funding. ‚ÄúThis bill would make a historic shift in child welfare funding by offering a way for moms and dads to get help and treatment rather than pitching in only after children are removed from home,‚Äù said Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. The bill is a compromise between four powerful members of Congress: Wyden; the Senate Finance committee‚Äôs Republican chair, Orrin Hatch of Utah; the Republican chair of the House Ways & Means Committee, Kevin Brady of Texas; and the ranking Democrat on Ways & Means, Sander Levin of Michigan. The plan offers ‚Äúbipartisan solutions for families and children affected by the opioid addiction crisis,‚Äù Hatch said in a statement. In December, a Reuters investigation revealed that at least 110 babies had died since 2010 after being born opioid-dependent and sent home with parents ill-prepared to care for them. No more than nine of the 50 U.S. states followed a federal law requiring them to help those newborns, the news agency found. In response to the Reuters series, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asked all states to report by June 30 whether and how they are following the existing law, known as the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. In May, the House passed legislation to improve safety planning for children born dependent on opioid drugs. Reanne Pederson of Devils Lake, N.D., one of the women portrayed in the Reuters series who accidentally smothered her newborn in bed while on drugs, said she was happy to hear about new funding possibilities. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to me that moms who are struggling with addiction get help,‚Äù she said.

Clinton leads Trump by 11 points in White House race: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"(Reuters) - Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 11 points in the U.S. presidential race, showing little change after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.   The online poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, shows 46 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 34.8 percent back Trump. Another 19.2 percent support neither candidate. Their parties hold conventions in July ahead of a Nov. 8 election. Clinton‚Äôs lead was nearly the same a week ago, before she had amassed enough convention delegates to win the nomination and before Trump drew criticism from leaders of both parties for questioning the impartiality of a Mexican-American judge. Trump, 69, enjoyed a bigger boost after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in May. Having trailed Clinton, 68, for most of the year, Trump briefly erased a double-digit gap and pulled about even with the former secretary of state. Clinton this week defeated party rival Bernie Sanders, 74, in four of six nominating contests, most notably California and New Jersey, and won the endorsements of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other party leaders. Trump this week sparred with party leaders and struggled with questions about his now-defunct Trump University. A lawsuit accuses Trump and the for-profit school of defrauding thousands of people, including many who paid as much as $35,000 to learn Trump‚Äôs real estate strategies.  A wealthy businessman who asserts the lawsuit is politically motivated, Trump said presiding U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was biased against him because of Trump‚Äôs plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Trump later added that Muslim judges could be biased against him also because of his pledge to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Trump‚Äôs comments drew sharp criticism from Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump later said he would no longer talk about the judge. Friday‚Äôs results had 1,276 respondents and a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.2 percentage points.

U.S. appeals court upholds 'quickie' union election rules,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday dismissed a bid by construction trade groups to block controversial Obama administration rules designed to speed up union elections, saying the National Labor Relations Board had broad authority to implement them. The Texas-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected claims by Associated Builders and Contractors Inc and a Texas chapter that the so-called ‚Äúquickie‚Äù election rules violated employers‚Äô free speech rights and would lead to union harassment of workers.  ‚ÄúThe board ... conducted an exhaustive and lengthy review of the issues, evidence and testimony, responded to contrary arguments, and offered factual and legal support for its final conclusions,‚Äù Circuit Judge Edith Brown Clement wrote.  The 5th Circuit is considered to be one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country and is a popular venue for legal challenges to Obama administration initiatives. The decision affirmed a 2015 ruling by a federal judge in Austin, Texas. The state‚Äôs chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business was also a plaintiff but was not involved in the appeal.  The rules, which took effect in April 2015, have shortened the period between a union filing a petition to represent workers and an election, from the previous median of 38 days to as little as two weeks.  Under the rules, employers cannot bring legal challenges to the way union campaigns are conducted until after an election and are required to share workers‚Äô names and contact details with unions once they file election petitions. The NLRB said the changes were necessary because a small number of companies were intentionally dragging out the election process, sometimes for months, to coerce workers to vote against unions.  Associated Builders and Contractors in its lawsuit said there was no evidence that was common, but the 5th Circuit on Friday said it was not the court‚Äôs role ‚Äúto weigh the evidence pro and con.‚Äù NLRB spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek declined to comment. ABC did not immediately return a request for comment. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business-backed groups last year made similar claims in a separate lawsuit challenging the new rules in federal court in Washington, D.C. A judge dismissed the case, and the groups did not appeal.  President Barack Obama in March 2015 vetoed a measure from Republicans in Congress that would have stopped the rules from taking effect. The case is Associated Builders and Contractors Inc v. National Labor Relations Board, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 15-50497. ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 "
Green groups fund-raise against Trump‚Äôs climate stance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs promise to gut U.S. environmental regulations and revive the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline if elected president is a nightmare for green groups, but it may be a dream come true for their fund-raisers. The country‚Äôs biggest environmental groups say the Republican White House hopeful‚Äôs pro-drilling and anti-global warming positions have sparked a record wave of donations and volunteer recruitment that could revitalize U.S. green advocacy. Trump has said he would revive the coal industry, pull the United States out of a global climate pact and expand oil drilling.  ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more powerful motivator than Donald Trump,‚Äù Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said. Brune said a spring email blast about the New York businessman to the San Francisco-based group‚Äôs members yielded $25,000 in donations, more than twice as much as projected, along with 15,000 new volunteers. The club‚Äôs Political Committee, which works directly on projects to engage voters during the election, has raised more than $62,000 this year, compared with just $22,000 at this point in the 2012 election, according to the filings with the Federal Election Commission.     The Washington-based League of Conservation Voters has also gotten a boost. Officials said its annual fund-raising dinner this week pulled in a record haul, which they would not disclose, after the group also used Trump as a focal point of its donor outreach. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time since there has been someone that our movement has so universally wanted to stop,‚Äù said spokesman David Willett.  The league‚Äôs Voters Action Fund, meanwhile, has raised more than $610,000 in donations so far this year for election-related work, more than triple what it pulled in during the same period of 2012, and more than double that of 2008, according to federal filings. Trump has long signaled his belief that global warming is a hoax. Last month he outlined plans to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by the Obama administration, scrap the Paris Climate Accord, and revive the Keystone XL - moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement. A spokeswoman for Trump‚Äôs campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NextGen Climate, a San Francisco-based environmental advocacy organization founded by billionaire activist Tom Steyer, has called Trump‚Äôs agenda ‚Äúfrightening.‚Äù But its efforts were also getting some traction from the candidate‚Äôs rhetoric.  The group, which has featured Trump in its TV ads to drive voter turnout, said it had seen a 127 percent increase in clicks on its social media postings that mention the candidate compared with those that do not. ‚ÄúThere is no question that voters are very engaged when it comes to fighting back against Trump,‚Äù said NextGen spokeswoman Suzanne Henkels. Ben Avery, associate fund-raising director of the Sierra Club‚Äôs Northwest chapter, said he was happy about the increase in donor support this year but was vexed by the reason behind it. ‚ÄúBad news is good news for fund-raising,‚Äù he said.

Trump's corporate targets face tricky task in fending off his attacks,"(Reuters) - As the White House race took off last summer, food giant Mondelez International found itself in an unusual position: Republican candidate Donald Trump began delivering broadsides against one of its iconic products, Oreo cookies. ‚ÄúNabisco is closing a factory in Chicago, and they‚Äôre moving to Mexico. No more Oreos. I don‚Äôt like Oreos anymore,‚Äù Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire on Aug. 14, reacting to reports that Mondelez was shutting down some production lines at its Nabisco subsidiary in Chicago while boosting output in Mexico. Trump‚Äôs statement that Mondelez was closing a Chicago factory was erroneous, as the company quickly pointed out, but that didn‚Äôt stop him from repeating it. It‚Äôs unusual for a top presidential candidate, especially a representative of the business-friendly Republican Party, to attack major U.S. corporations by name.  But over the course of his unconventional campaign, Trump has aimed his fire at a range of companies, mostly for shifting jobs abroad (Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Corp unit Carrier Corp) but also for building products in foreign markets (Apple) and for what he said were violations of antitrust laws (Amazon).  Trump has threatened the companies with boycotts, tariffs, taxes and other punishments. The Trump campaign declined to comment for this story.  Some of the companies saw their share prices dip in the wake of Trump‚Äôs criticism while others experienced a small boost. But all of them were presented with a dilemma that‚Äôs familiar to the presumptive nominee‚Äôs many vanquished Republican rivals: Should they engage with a possible future president known for holding a grudge, possibly inviting more wrath, or should they lie low and risk allowing Trump to define them and to push policies they deem harmful? Most have sought to stay out of the fray even as Trump has kept up the drumbeat of criticism. ‚ÄúI am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States Many companies ‚Äì like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier ‚Äì are moving production to Mexico,‚Äù Trump said this week. This was ‚Äúbad for all Americans,‚Äù he said.    It was the first time Trump included GM in his roster of corporate wrongdoers, though the Trump campaign later removed GM from the statement and declined to say why. GM declined comment.      Mondelez, previously known as Kraft Foods, took a different tack. After Trump vowed to boycott Oreos, Mondelez fielded numerous media inquiries and contacted reporters when the company deemed press coverage of his remarks off base, said Laurie Guzzinati, who oversees governmental affairs in North America for Mondelez. The company didn‚Äôt engage in any Trump-bashing, though Guzzinati said Trump‚Äôs comments were ‚Äúgrounded in inaccuracies.‚Äù  She said she told reporters that Mondelez would continue to make Oreos in three locations in the United States, countering the impression Trump may have left that Oreos would no longer be made in the United States. Mondelez‚Äôs response tracks closely what crisis management experts recommend for Trump-targeted companies.   Hilary Rosen, a managing director for Washington, D.C., communications firm SKD Knickerbocker, said her firm was representing corporate clients who have been singled out by Trump, though she declined to name them.  Rosen‚Äôs advice to clients, she said, is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt depend on educating Donald Trump on the truth. People have tried and failed.‚Äù Rosen, a Democrat, recommends instead that companies make their case to the journalists who cover Trump, so ‚ÄúDonald Trump does not define you.‚Äù None of the companies targeted by Trump acknowledged hiring outside consultants to deal with his criticism. Many declined to comment for this story.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to win in a one-on-one confrontation with Donald Trump. You‚Äôre just going to get mired in the mud,‚Äù said Juda Engelmayer, senior vice president for crisis management at 5W Public Relations in New York.  Those who have been willing to engage, including Ford Chairman Bill Ford, have avoided getting too personal. Trump has railed against Ford for manufacturing vehicles in Mexico, threatening a tariff of up to 40 percent on ‚Äúevery car, bumper and part‚Äù entering the United States from Mexico.  Ford, the great-grandson of the automaker‚Äôs founder Henry Ford, called Trump‚Äôs critique ‚Äúdistorted‚Äù and said the company instead should be ‚Äúheld up as a real success story.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt take the (government) bailout,‚Äù during the 2007-2009 recession, Ford told reporters at a conference in Detroit on May 23, contrasting his company with GM and Chrysler. ‚ÄúWe paid back our debts. We pulled ourselves up by our boot straps. We are investing in America.‚Äù  Crisis management experts said companies targeted by Trump need to be thinking more about the policy implications of his presidency. That means, for example, shoring up support in the U.S. Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has said he wants to renegotiate.    A trade lobbyist who asked not to be named because he has worked with one of the companies Trump has called out said Trump‚Äôs attacks do not particularly hurt companies‚Äô reputations in Washington, because policymakers understand presidential campaigns are the ‚Äúpolitical silly season.‚Äù But, he said, they can impact broader efforts on trade and other policies. ‚ÄúI think what this suggests,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis that there needs to be a concentrated effort by the business community to talk about the benefits of trade.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 "
Exclusive: Obama approves broader role for U.S. forces in Afghanistan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has approved giving the U.S. military greater ability to accompany and enable Afghan forces battling a resilient Taliban insurgency, in a move to assist them more proactively on the battlefield, a U.S. official told Reuters.  The senior U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the decision would also allow greater use of U.S. air power, particularly close air support. However, the official cautioned: ‚ÄúThis is not a blanket order to target the Taliban.‚Äù Obama‚Äôs decision again redefines America‚Äôs support role in  Afghanistan‚Äôs grinding conflict, more than a year after international forces wrapped up their combat mission and shifted the burden to Afghan troops. It also comes ahead of Obama‚Äôs eagerly anticipated decision on whether to forge ahead with a scheduled reduction in the numbers of U.S. troops from about 9,800 currently to 5,500 by the start of 2017. A group of retired generals and senior diplomats urged Obama last week to forgo those plans, warning they could undermine the fight against the Afghan Taliban, whose leader was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan last month. Under the new policy, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, will be able to decide when it is appropriate for American troops to accompany conventional Afghan forces into the field - something they have so far only been doing with Afghan special forces, the official said. The expanded powers are only meant to be employed ‚Äúin those select instances in which their engagement can enable strategic effects on the battlefield,‚Äù the official said. That means that U.S. forces should not be expected to accompany Afghan soldiers on day-to-day missions. ‚ÄúThis added flexibility ... is fully supported by the Afghan government and will help the Afghans at an important moment for the country,‚Äù the official said. The decision is a departure from current U.S. rules of engagement in Afghanistan, which impose limits on U.S. forces‚Äô ability to strike at insurgents. For example, the U.S. military was previously allowed to take action against the Taliban ‚Äúin extremis‚Äù - moments when their assistance was needed to prevent a significant Afghan military setback. That definition, however, left the U.S. military postured to assist them in more defensive instances. The new policy would allow U.S. forces to accompany Afghans at key moments in their  offensive campaign against the Taliban. ‚ÄúThe U.S. forces will more proactively support Afghan conventional forces,‚Äù the official said. The Taliban control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since they were ousted by a U.S.-backed intervention in late 2001, and U.S. officials have acknowledged the uneven performance of Afghan security forces. Large portions of Afghanistan, including the provincial capital of northern Kunduz and multiple districts of southern Helmand province, have fallen, at times briefly, to the Taliban over the past year-and-a-half. Many other districts and provinces are also under varying degrees of Taliban control. The new authorities that Obama has given the U.S. military could give it greater leeway in addressing the shortcomings of Afghan security forces. Still, experts warn that its hard to predict when Afghanistan will be able to stand on its own against the Taliban, not to mention the country‚Äôs enormous economic difficulties and fractious political system. The U.S government‚Äôs top watchdog on Afghanistan told Reuters that the United States had wasted billions of dollars in reconstruction aid to Afghanistan over the past decade, and now a renewed Taliban insurgency was threatening the gains that had been made.

Warren to keep up assault on White House hopeful Trump over judge comments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren will keep up her assault on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday in a strongly worded speech labeling Trump a racist and accusing the Republican Party of fostering his intolerance. ‚ÄúDonald Trump chose racism as his weapon, but his aim is exactly the same as the rest of the Republicans,‚Äù Warren will say in remarks to be delivered at a Washington meeting of the American Constitution Society, a liberal group. Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street, is a favorite among liberals as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton, who this week became the presumptive Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump has drawn strong criticism, including from some Republican leaders, for his attacks on Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against his now defunct real estate training school. The Republican candidate has accused Curiel, an American  born in Indiana, of having an inherent bias against him because of his heritage and Trump‚Äôs campaign pledges on curbing illegal immigration, such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. ‚ÄúJudge Curiel is one of countless American patriots who has spent decades quietly serving his country, sometimes at great risk to his own life,‚Äù Warren will say. ‚ÄúDonald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves nobody but himself.‚Äù     Thursday‚Äôs remarks will be just the latest in a war of words between Trump and Warren. Trump has dubbed Warren ‚Äúgoofy,‚Äù and often taunts her on the campaign trail, while Warren has branded Trump a ‚Äúloser‚Äù and last month tweeted that his ‚Äúrecord is embarrassing.‚Äù Reuters reported on Wednesday that Warren will soon endorse Clinton, after months of remaining neutral in the Democratic primary battle between Clinton and her challenger from the left, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Warren has considered the idea of serving as Clinton‚Äôs running mate although she sees obstacles to that choice, sources said. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 "
Mexico steps up dialogue with U.S. firms over economy - minister,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has increased dialogue with American companies to make the case for bilateral economic ties, a senior official said on Thursday, in an effort to counter anti-Mexican rhetoric in the U.S. presidential campaign. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said Mexico is ‚Äúkilling‚Äù U.S. trade, threatening to build a border wall to keep out migrants, block remittances sent home by Mexicans, and raise tariffs against Mexico to protect U.S. jobs. While generally at pains to avoid addressing Trump directly, Mexican government officials have warned that his proposals could do serious damage to both nations‚Äô economies. Paulo Carreno, Mexico‚Äôs new deputy foreign minister responsible for North America, was appointed in April to lead a drive to bolster his country‚Äôs standing in the United States. Since then, Mexico‚Äôs diplomatic network in the United States has stepped up efforts to reach out to business leaders, as well as politicians and academics, Carreno said, keen to stress that his government took no side in the presidential contest. Of the companies Mexico had met, the majority agreed with a model of bilateral economic cooperation based on free trade that did not involve a border wall, or protective tariffs, he said. ‚ÄúThey understand the benefit of greater commercial integration, and they live from it in a way,‚Äù said Carreno. ‚ÄúThey agree that the model we have today is the better one, though of course that‚Äôs not to say it can‚Äôt be improved.‚Äù U.S.-Mexico trade is worth some $500 billion every year and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says roughly 6 million American jobs depend on it. In addition, an estimated 35 million people in the United States are Mexican or of Mexican background. Mexican business leaders say U.S. companies are crucial allies in their battle to counter Trump‚Äôs arguments. Carreno did not detail which companies Mexico was meeting, though senior officials have said previously that those with major operations south of the border are key interlocutors. They include firms like General Electric as well as carmakers General Motors and Ford. Both carmakers have been attacked by Trump in the campaign for investing in Mexico.

Obama is 'fired up' for Clinton as Democrats seek to unify party,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama formally endorsed Hillary Clinton‚Äôs White House bid on Thursday and called for Democrats to unite behind her after a protracted battle with Bernie Sanders for the party nomination. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also backed Clinton on Thursday, telling MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Rachel Maddow Show‚Äù that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was ‚Äúa genuine threat to the country.‚Äù Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said it ‚Äúmeans the world‚Äù to her that Obama had her back in a bruising campaign for the Nov. 8 election.  Clinton also said she had the ‚Äúhighest regard‚Äù for Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street, and was ‚Äúreally pleased to have her good ideas and support.‚Äù Vice President Joe Biden also waded into the campaign on Thursday. ‚ÄúWhoever the next president is, and God willing in my view it will be Secretary Clinton,‚Äù Biden said in a speech at the American Constitution Society in Washington. The Obama endorsement increases pressure on Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, to bow out of the race and lend his support to Clinton so that the party can focus on defeating Trump. ‚ÄúIt is absolutely a joy and an honor that President Obama and I over the years have gone from fierce competitors to true friends,‚Äù Clinton told Reuters in an interview. After an unexpectedly tough battle against Sanders‚Äô challenge from the left, former first lady Clinton made history when she reached the number of delegates needed to win the party nomination this week. That made her the first woman to lead a major U.S. party as its White House candidate. Obama, who enjoys rising approval ratings as he nears the end of eight years in office, will appear with Clinton on the campaign trail next week in Wisconsin. The two were opponents in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary race, which Obama won, but they buried their rivalry and she served as his secretary of state for four years. Clinton is the 2016 candidate who the White House believes will best safeguard Obama‚Äôs legacy. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been someone so qualified to hold this office,‚Äù Obama said of Clinton in a video. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with her. I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there and campaign for Hillary.‚Äù  Trump assailed the endorsement on Twitter: ‚ÄúHe wants four more years of Obama‚Äîbut nobody else does!‚Äù  Clinton‚Äôs campaign tweeted a brash response: ‚ÄúDelete your account.‚Äù Sanders, who galvanized young voters with his calls for more social equality and measures to rein in Wall Street, has been reluctant to concede the race, despite concerns among leading Democrats that continuing party divisions could hamper Clinton‚Äôs efforts to beat Trump. Obama and other senior Democrats are seeking a delicate balance of rallying the party behind Clinton, while not alienating Sanders and his supporters. In what appeared to be an attempt to gently ease Sanders toward giving up his campaign, Obama met the democratic socialist for about an hour in the White House, laughing warmly as they walked into the Oval Office. Although Sanders told reporters afterward that he still planned to compete in the final nominating contest in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday, he said he would work with Clinton to defeat Trump.  Sanders was then welcomed on Capitol Hill by Senator Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the Senate. Reid said the lawmaker from Vermont was in a ‚Äúgood place‚Äù with his Democratic colleagues. He suggested that Sanders was close to acknowledging defeat by Clinton. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear a single word about him trying to change the fact that she is the nominee, I think he‚Äôs accepted that,‚Äù Reid told reporters. In the endorsement video, Obama recalled the party unity that followed his prolonged primary battle against Clinton in 2008. ‚ÄúSecretary Clinton and Senator Sanders may have been rivals during this primary, but they‚Äôre both patriots who love this country and they share a vision for an America that we all believe in,‚Äù Obama said. Warren told MSNBC she was endorsing Clinton because ‚Äúa female fighter in the lead is exactly what this country needs.‚Äù Warren‚Äôs populist credentials will boost Clinton‚Äôs ability to court Sanders voters as she prepares to battle Trump. Warren was the only female Democratic U.S. senator who did not endorse Clinton during the primary race. Clinton told Reuters she and Warren had similar views about issues such as economic policy and protecting the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Warren pushed to start.  Trump said in an interview with Reuters last month that he would try to dismantle the Dodd-Frank law. In the interview with Reuters, Clinton said her overall economic package, including plans to rein in Wall Street and cut taxes for the middle class, would come during the first 100 days of her presidency if she defeats Trump. Clinton previously said a plan to generate jobs by investing in transportation and other infrastructure spending and immigration reform would be among other early priorities. ‚ÄúOne of the things that President Obama said yesterday is he thought his job was to remind the American people what a really serious job this is, the tough choices, the hard decisions, the high stakes in choosing a president and commander in chief,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúAnd I know how important it is to get off to a really good start in the White House,‚Äù she said.     Trump, a wealthy real estate developer who became the party‚Äôs presumptive nominee last month after seeing off a large group of rivals, is well behind Clinton‚Äôs campaign in terms of fundraising and policy infrastructure. On Thursday, his top donors were holding their first official meeting in New York. Trump also met with industry leaders in New York at an event organized by oil billionaire Harold Hamm.

U.S. House passes Puerto Rico debt relief bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Following months of internal wrangling, the U.S. House of Representatives, on Thursday passed legislation creating a federal control board to help Puerto Rico cope with crippling debt that is wreaking havoc throughout the island‚Äôs economy. By a vote of 297-127, the House approved the bill, sending it to the Senate for consideration. Some leading Democratic senators have voiced concerns about provisions, including one that potentially could reduce the minimum wage for young Puerto Ricans. But given the overwhelming support in the House and a looming July 1 deadline for Puerto Rico to make a $1.9 billion debt payment, senators may be hesitant to delay or tinker very much with the bill. Following the House vote, the White House in a statement urged the Senate to act promptly ‚Äúso the president can sign the bill into law ahead of the critical July 1st debt payment deadline.‚Äù The legislation was bolstered by rare bipartisan cooperation between the White House and the House‚Äôs Republicans and Democrats over the past six months. House Speaker Paul Ryan urged Congress to act quickly on the ‚ÄúPuerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act‚Äù (PROMESA), warning lawmakers of a ‚Äúdeepening crisis‚Äù on the island. ‚ÄúNow the island is shutting down,‚Äù Ryan said, with ‚Äúclosed schools; hospitals are beginning to close, that‚Äôs today. Tomorrow there could be policemen without cars, there could be blackouts at hospitals.‚Äù Nevertheless, some lawmakers feared that allowing Puerto Rico to restructure its $70 billion debt in a way that changes the seniority of the creditors - for instance by making them all equal or subordinated to pensioners - would set a bad precedent for other U.S. states with debt problems. Puerto Rico does not enjoy Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection, unlike the 50 U.S. states. The territory, which has a 45 percent poverty rate amid high unemployment, is also plagued by a growing migration of residents to the U.S. mainland. Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt problems come as its government and healthcare industry struggle to contain the spread of the Zika virus, which is blamed for severe birth defects and other neurological diseases.  On Tuesday, Aeromed, the island‚Äôs only active air ambulance company, announced it was suspending its services, blaming the large government debt.     The oversight board would be tasked with working with investors on restructuring the U.S. territory‚Äôs $70 billion debt. Before passage, the House approved an amendment giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets. Representative Raul Grijalva, like many Democrats, criticized major elements of the bill but argued it was the best possible in the Republican-controlled Congress. ‚ÄúThe oversight board is too powerful and is yet another infringement on the sovereignty of the people of Puerto Rico and they are right to find it offensive,‚Äù Grijalva said.   Despite its support for the overall bill, the White House noted that minimum wage and other labor provisions ‚Äúfurther exacerbate the economic disparities between Puerto Rico and the mainland United States‚Äù and ‚Äúdo nothing to address the (debt) crisis.‚Äù Supporters praised PROMESA for not using taxpayer funds to help the island reschedule its debt. Failure to pass it, they warned, could put Congress in the difficult position of ultimately overseeing a massive bailout of Puerto Rico.

Emails in Clinton probe dealt with planned drone strikes: WSJ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Emails between U.S. diplomats in Islamabad and State Department officials in Washington about whether to challenge specific U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan are at the center of a criminal probe involving Hillary Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified information, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The 2011 and 2012 emails were sent via the ‚Äúlow side‚Äù -government slang for a computer system for unclassified matters - as part of a secret arrangement that gave the State Department more of a voice in whether a CIA drone strike went ahead, according to congressional and law enforcement officials briefed on the FBI probe, the Journal said. Some of the emails were then forwarded by Clinton‚Äôs aides to her personal email account, which routed them to a server she kept at her home in suburban New York when she was secretary of state, the officials said, according to the newspaper. Investigators have raised concerns that Clinton‚Äôs personal server was less secure than State Department systems, and a recent report by the State Department inspector general found that Clinton had broken government rules by using a private email server without approval, undermining Clinton‚Äôs earlier defenses of her emails.    The still-secret emails are a key part of the FBI investigation that has long dogged Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign, the officials told the Journal. Clinton this week clinched the Democratic presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election and was endorsed by President Barack Obama on Thursday. The White House rebuffed questions by reporters on Thursday on whether Obama‚Äôs endorsement might be seen as unduly influencing a criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department involving Clinton. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama ‚Äúhas reiterated his commitment to this principle that any criminal investigation should be conducted independent of any sort of political interference.‚Äù The emails, which did not mention the ‚ÄúCIA,‚Äù ‚Äúdrones‚Äù or details about the militant targets, were written within the often-narrow time frame in which State Department officials had to decide whether or not to object to drone strikes before the CIA pulled the trigger, the officials said, according to the Journal. Law enforcement and intelligence officials said State Department deliberations about the covert CIA drone program should have been conducted over a more secure government computer system designed to handle classified information, the Journal reported.

S&P ratchets up pressure on Alaska over budget,"(Reuters) - S&P Global Ratings warned on Thursday that the credit rating for key Alaska bonds could go down if lawmakers fail to agree on a budget that addresses the state‚Äôs long term-fiscal problems.  Alaska Governor Bill Walker convened a special session of the legislature late last month aimed at passing a budget for fiscal 2017 and closing the state‚Äôs nearly $4 billion deficit, which has been driven by a collapse in global oil prices.  S&P on Thursday put the state‚Äôs AA-plus general obligation, AA appropriation, and A-plus moral obligation ratings on Alaska‚Äôs debt on CreditWatch with negative implications.  The bond proceeds are expected to pay for several transportation-related projects.  ‚ÄúThe CreditWatch placement indicates that we may lower Alaska‚Äôs credit rating if state policymakers defer adopting fiscal reforms to correct the state‚Äôs structural budget deficit,‚Äù said Gabriel Petek, a S&P Global Ratings credit analyst.  Since the special session began late last month the legislature has passed a $4.4 billion spending plan for fiscal 2017 and a bill to reduce the cost of the state‚Äôs oil and gas tax credit program, S&P said.  But it is unclear if a hotly contested bill that would transfer money from the state‚Äôs permanent fund to its general fund will overcome opposition in the state House of Representatives. The bill, SB 128, would reduce the amount paid out to residents annually from the fund. Even if it passes, S&P said it remains to be seen whether SB 128 and other fiscal reforms would be sufficient to put Alaska‚Äôs fiscal structure on a sustainable trajectory.  ‚ÄúEnactment of SB 128 alone would shrink the deficit, but it wouldn‚Äôt eliminate it. In order to fully close the structural fiscal gap, other measures ‚Äì such as new income tax or more spending cuts ‚Äì would also be necessary,‚Äù S&P said.  Despite the budget deficit, S&P said Alaska continues to have very strong credit quality due to the large reserves it built up over times when oil prices were high.  ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 "
"U.S. Congress scrutinizes pay TV billing, competitive practices","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel disclosed Thursday it is investigating pay TV competition and customer service issues and will call executives from top cable and satellite providers to testify. The investigation comes as the U.S. cable and satellite TV industry ranks among the lowest in consumer surveys over billing and other practices.  Senators Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who chairs a panel on investigations and Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said in a statement Thursday that they will hold a June 23 hearing that will include testimony from Comcast Corp, Charter Communications, DirectTV, a unit of AT&T Inc and Dish Network Corp. The pair said in a joint statement the panel has been investigating the largest cable and satellite TV companies for more than a year, looking at potential barriers to competition in the industry, ‚Äúincluding the difficulties faced by companies attempting to create innovative new television delivery models.‚Äù  The committee has also been examining billing, fees, refunds and other customer service issues. ‚ÄúWe believe our hearing will be a big step forward for consumers, allowing them to understand how their TV providers really work and make informed decisions about their video service,‚Äù the pair said.  Comcast declined to comment. Charter, which completed its acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in May, said in a statement ‚Äúour overall customer satisfaction ratings are trending in the right direction. Call volume into our call centers is declining, as are service calls.‚Äù The senators noted that a recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey found pay television service ranked near the bottom of the 43 industries surveyed - a year after the pay-TV industry tied for the lowest score among all industries ranked. The hearing follows a Federal Communications Commission proposal to allow consumers to swap pricey cable and other pay TV boxes for cheaper devices and apps, a change that would boost competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. The proposal would let customers get video services from providers like Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo Inc. It set off a lobbying battle between tech companies eager to tap into the market and cable and TV companies which could lose billions of dollars in rental fees. The FCC says 99 percent of U.S. customers now must get their boxes from their cable companies, and they pay on average $231 a year to lease the devices. Cable companies say the video marketplace is already evolving as more customers replace traditional pay TV services with streaming internet video. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 "
"Bernie Sanders-style, grassroots effort a likely model, say Trump donors","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign is likely to launch a small donor fundraising effort akin to the grassroots one that powered another insurgent presidential contender, Democrat Bernie Sanders, according to two top donors who attended the first official meeting of Trump‚Äôs national finance team.  The Trump finance machine kickoff took place at New York City‚Äôs Four Seasons Hotel amid growing concerns about the Republican presidential candidate‚Äôs lack of a campaign infrastructure heading into a Nov. 8 election battle against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúThe pitch to this group in the room was a traditional pitch, but the backroom discussion was, because of this being a populist movement, there‚Äôs going to be significant outreach to, you know, those who give $1, $2, $20,‚Äù said Trump Texas fundraising co-chairman Gaylord Hughey. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge opportunity there.‚Äù Sanders, who has effectively lost the 2016 presidential nomination to Clinton, broke fundraising records during his long-shot bid for the presidency, collecting more than $210 million through more than 7.4 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece.    Trump could well find his supporters eager to pitch in $1, $5 or $20. For a story in May, Reuters found that nearly all three dozen Trump supporters it interviewed were not only unmoved by Trump‚Äôs about-face to accept money from outside donors, they said they would also happily contribute. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment about replicating the fundraising apparatus of Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont. Some donors were fearful of the late start of Thursday‚Äôs gathering. Normally such a meeting would take place two years earlier in a candidate‚Äôs campaign. But others in attendance said they left assured that Trump would be able to easily plug into the Republican National Committee‚Äôs robust infrastructure. Trump, a wealthy businessman, became the presumptive Republican nominee last month after seeing off 16 rivals in a largely self-funded primary campaign. The gathering featured talks by Trump, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, chief strategist Paul Manafort, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, former rival-turned-ally Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Republican fundraisers Ray Washburne and Lew Eisenberg. Trump‚Äôs late start on fundraising has raised questions about whether he can achieve his previously stated aim of raising $1 billion before November. On the Democratic side, Clinton‚Äôs well-oiled operation is well ahead of schedule. Trump is also¬†pulling back from his earlier statements on his fundraising goal. Campaign manager Lewandowski told Reuters on Wednesday that he sees no need for Trump to raise that sum and that Trump may be able to stick to his low-cost style of campaigning. That includes garnering free media, which is estimated will reach a value of $5 billion by November, according to media analytics firm mediaQuant. That is more than double what Clinton is likely to get, mediaQuant says. While Trump shot to the top of the Republican race with freewheeling rhetoric, insults of rivals and promises to get tough on issues such as illegal immigration, even his biggest donors say they are discouraged by the candidate‚Äôs attacks in recent weeks on a Mexican-American judge. In comments that have been widely condemned, Trump has suggested that U.S. Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a case against Trump University, has an inherent bias because of his heritage. ‚ÄúHe needs to stop the campaign infighting, shut up and stop calling an American who was born in Indiana a Mexican,‚Äù said Texas billionaire Doug Deason.

Clinton has repeatedly said she chose ‚Äúnot to keep‚Äù some 30,000 emails her lawyers deemed personal, which has been widely interpreted as meaning she deleted the personal emails.

U.S. representatives question bank regulator on whistleblowers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the congressional committee that investigates data breaches and computer hacking blasted the main U.S. banking regulator on Thursday for possibly jeopardizing the work of its inspector general, an internal watchdog, and hunting out potential whistleblowers.  Part of the House Science Committee for months has been looking into the theft of thousands of records from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, including two breaches in which workers downloaded more than 10,000 sensitive and private records onto portable storage devices before leaving the agency‚Äôs employ. In a letter to FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, Lamar Smith, the committee‚Äôs chairman, and Barry Loudermilk, chairman of the subcommittee on oversight, described an agency slow to cooperate with lawmakers that fails to conduct ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù searches for requested information. Moreover, the two, both Republicans, said the FDIC had gathered and reviewed internal communications of its inspector general‚Äôs office while collecting documents that the committee had requested.  By law, inspectors general are independent. They function as the ethical and legal consciences of federal agencies, rooting out fraud and mismanagement, often with information provided confidentially by employees. ‚ÄúNot only is the committee troubled that the FDIC continues to withhold pertinent and responsive information to its cybersecurity posture,‚Äù it is ‚Äúeven more concerned by the FDIC‚Äôs gathering and review‚Äù of the inspector general office‚Äôs internal communications, they wrote. That could compromise the inspector general‚Äôs ‚Äúability to conduct its work in a manner uninhibited by the very agency it was created to oversee,‚Äù they added. The FDIC was not immediately available to comment. When the committee received documents from the FDIC earlier this week, the lawmakers said, it noticed a ‚Äúdistinct watermark included on each page.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGiven the committee‚Äôs concerns about potential retaliation against whistleblowers discussed in previous letters to the FDIC, the FDIC‚Äôs inclusion of a novel watermark raises serious questions about whether the agency it attempting to identify the source of committee materials,‚Äù they said. They added that some of the watermarked pages covered communications between the inspector general and FDIC employees, raising concerns that the agency is attempting to identify confidential informants. The committee is demanding that the FDIC send it information on actions to protect whistleblowers and inspector general communications by Monday, June 13. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 "

Michigan lawmakers approve Detroit school rescue package,"(Reuters) - Legislation approved by Michigan lawmakers on Thursday to bail out the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) will keep the district operating, but falls short on funding to fix its crumbling buildings, according to school officials. The bill package, approved over objections by Democratic lawmakers, creates a new, debt-free district governed by an elected school board, while leaving the current district in place solely to levy property taxes to pay off outstanding debt. DPS, which has nearly 46,000 students, has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency. The American Federation of Teachers-Michigan and Detroit Federation of Teachers criticized the lack of a bipartisan compromise in a joint statement on Thursday. ‚ÄúThese bills are a statement by non-Detroit Republicans that they know what is best for Detroit, a city that is overwhelmingly people of color,‚Äù the groups said. ‚ÄúIt has been this attitude that resulted in Detroit Public Schools‚Äô massive debt, low academic performance and a ‚Äòwild west‚Äô system of school openings.‚Äù Under the measures approved on Thursday, Michigan would commit $617 million from the state‚Äôs share of a tobacco settlement in annual increments of $72 million for the new Detroit Community School District. An emergency state loan for transition costs was capped at $150 million, with only $25 million of that amount available for capital improvements, less than the overall $200 million sought by DPS. ‚ÄúWe also look forward to working creatively with the governor‚Äôs office, the state superintendent, and the Michigan Department of Education to identify the remainder of the critical resources necessary to educate our students,‚Äù DPS state-appointed transition manager Steven Rhodes said in a statement. A smaller bailout passed by the House in May raised concerns that DPS would run out of cash later this summer. Republican lawmakers contended the final $617 million bailout legislation would prevent DPS from filing for municipal bankruptcy even though Rhodes, a former federal bankruptcy judge, has said such a move would be ineffective because much of the district‚Äôs debt is guaranteed by the state. Democrats objected to the absence of a Detroit Education Commission to oversee the opening and closing of public and charter schools in Detroit. The House and Senate approved the package with a series of votes late Wednesday and early Thursday, sending the legislation to the desk of Republican Governor Rick Snyder, who signaled in a statement that he supports it.

House committee moves to cut funding for financial regulators,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to slash funding for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service and other financial regulators passed a key committee in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a long partisan fight. The expansive legislation would also place a halt on the payday lending restrictions that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently proposed. The Appropriations Committee voted 30-17 to approve the bill allocating funds for financial services and general government, which now goes to the full House. One of the committee‚Äôs senior Democrats, Jose Serrano of New York, warned that the ‚Äúbill in its current form will be vetoed.‚Äù  The Senate must still pass accompanying legislation. After that, both chambers will reconcile their bills into a single piece for President Barack Obama to sign or veto. Congress has tangled over budget laws for years, and federal agencies frequently rely on temporary continuing resolutions for funding. Republicans cast the bill as a way to streamline agencies and hold them accountable for spending decisions, while saving taxpayer money. Democrats attacked what they called ‚Äúriders‚Äù to the bill, such as a measure to stop the Federal Communications Commission‚Äôs net neutrality rule and one to prevent corporations from being required to disclose political donations. They also said cuts to the SEC would hobble the agency in carrying out its duties and implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Earlier this month the CFPB, charged with shielding consumers from financial fraud, proposed rules to limit short-term borrowings known as ‚Äúpayday‚Äù loans, which can charge interest as high as 390 percent. Critics say the proposal will cut off credit to poor people who may need small loans during emergencies. Representative Steven Palazzo, a Mississippi Republican, proposed an amendment on Thursday to delay implementing the rules until the bureau reports to Congress on their possible effects, saying he was concerned they could force people to turn to loan sharks.  Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been one of the few members of her party to oppose the rules, and had sponsored a bill to delay CFPB rules for two years.  Wasserman Schultz, who is also a U.S. representative from Florida, reversed her position in the last week.

U.S. top court deals blow to Puerto Rico sovereignty claim,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Puerto Rico cannot pursue charges against people for the same crime that federal authorities have already prosecuted them, dealing a blow to the U.S. territory‚Äôs claim that while it is not a state it should be treated like one. The court ruled 6-2 in favor of defendants Luis Sanchez Valle and Jaime Gomez Vazquez, who were charged with illegally selling guns in 2008 by Puerto Rican authorities as well as federal prosecutors. The two pleaded guilty to the federal charges and then argued that Puerto Rico‚Äôs indictments should be dismissed because of the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution that bars people from being prosecuted twice for the same offense. A trial judge dismissed the Puerto Rico charges, but they were reinstated by an appeals court. In a March 2015 ruling, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruled against prosecutors, prompting the territory to appeal to the high court. On its surface, the case was about criminal law. But it also raised questions about the extent to which the Caribbean island, which has been a U.S. territory since 1898, has sovereign powers akin to any of the 50 U.S. states. The double jeopardy clause allows U.S. states and the federal government to prosecute people separately for the same actions because they are separate sovereign entities. The Supreme Court, in a ruling authored by Justice Elena Kagan, said that the original source of power for Puerto Rico‚Äôs Constitution came from the U.S. Congress, via a 1950 law. ‚ÄúPut simply, Congress conferred the authority to create the Puerto Rico Constitution, which in turn confers the authority to bring criminal charges,‚Äù Kagan wrote. Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico, and Stephen Breyer dissented. Some experts saw the federal government‚Äôs argument against treating Puerto Rico as a separate governmental entity as having implications for another issue: how to deal with the territory‚Äôs debt crisis. In such a scenario, that argument could help establish a legal precedent that Puerto Rico is not a sovereign entity, possibly to justify imposing a federal control board or some other mechanism to address Puerto Rico‚Äôs roughly $70 billion in debt.¬†The U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation on the issue. The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of the month in another case involving Puerto Rico‚Äôs bid to revive a law that would allow it to cut billions of dollars in debt at public utilities in a key test in its quest to weather its crisis.

House Speaker Ryan security agenda veers from Trump's,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled a national security policy featuring stronger defense on Thursday, part of his agenda to unify Republicans after a divisive primary campaign, but softening some of the hard lines taken by the party‚Äôs presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump. The plan is sharply critical of President Barack Obama, blaming the Democrat for ‚Äúeight years of broken promises, concessions, and retreat‚Äù in the Syrian civil war, nuclear deal with Iran, chilly relations with Russia and dealings with a bellicose North Korea. It would overturn or back away from what Obama allies see as his foreign policy achievements, including the Iran deal and his moves toward normal relations with Communist-ruled Cuba. And it criticizes efforts to close the Guantanamo detention center. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too much to say that our enemies no longer fear us and too many of our allies no longer trust us. And I think this is a direct result of the president‚Äôs foreign policy,‚Äù Ryan said as he and other House Republicans introduced the plan at the Council on Foreign Relations. While not providing figures, the plan also calls for an end to military rollbacks and demands ‚Äúadequate, predictable budgets.‚Äù Trump, whom Ryan has endorsed in the presidential race, has made a promise to erect a massive wall along the Mexican border - a centerpiece of his campaign. The plan announced on Thursday includes a range of border security measures such as ‚Äúhigh fencing,‚Äù aerial surveillance and radar, but not a large wall. The plan echoes some of Trump‚Äôs concerns about Muslim immigrants, with calls to tighten refugee screening and discussion of ways to prevent the radicalization of youths. ‚ÄúWe must constantly reassess our defenses in order to find and close security gaps so that Islamist militants cannot slip into our country undetected,‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs plan said. Representative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, said the intention was not to target followers of any one religion, but to do everything possible to not admit those who would attack Americans. ‚ÄúWhat we have to do is target the threat and make sure that they don‚Äôt come in,‚Äù said McCaul, one of several Republican committee chairmen who joined Ryan at the report presentation. The plan is not isolationist. It takes a strong line on battling militants abroad, saying the United States must keep all options on the table and ‚Äúeliminate terrorist sanctuaries.‚Äù  Trump has been critical of some U.S. alliances. Ryan‚Äôs plan, in contrast, underscores the importance of NATO. It also includes many standard Republican policy prescriptions, such as strong ties to Israel, advocacy of severe sanctions on Iran and an insistence that Washington should stand up to Russia. It also calls for more trade agreements and says foreign aid programs should make recipient countries self-sufficient. The plan calls for increased security for diplomats and facilities overseas. In that context, it mentions the 2012 attacks on Benghazi, which many Republicans cite to criticize then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump‚Äôs rival in the White House race. Several of Thursday‚Äôs speakers criticized Clinton as they blasted Obama‚Äôs foreign policy, because she was the nation‚Äôs top diplomat during the first four years of his term.  Democrats sought to tie the plan to some of Trump‚Äôs most controversial statements, including his rejection of alliances like NATO, advocacy of waterboarding and calls for attacks on the families of terrorist suspects. ‚ÄúPerhaps this agenda is light on details because the Republican presidential candidate has offered a truly disturbing vision of America‚Äôs role in the world,‚Äù Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. Ryan, the country‚Äôs highest-ranking elected Republican, has described the agenda as a way to offer voters a coherent policy message for 2017. He unveiled an anti-poverty agenda on Monday. Initiatives on regulation, constitutional authority, healthcare and tax reform are expected in the coming weeks. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 "

"Sanders returns to Washington, meets with Obama on next steps","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders returned to Washington for meetings on Thursday with President Barack Obama and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid as Democrats pressured him to end his presidential campaign and support Hillary Clinton after a hard-fought primary race. Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, secured enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination this week and become the first woman to lead a major U.S. party as its presidential nominee. Despite Clinton‚Äôs commanding victories in California and New Jersey in presidential contests on Tuesday, Sanders vowed to carry his populist campaign to the Democratic National Convention in July, when the party‚Äôs nominee is formally chosen. Obama, who is expected to endorse Clinton soon, was scheduled to meet with Sanders at the White House on Thursday at 11:15 a.m. (1515 GMT). Sanders will meet with Reid, his Senate colleague, in the afternoon. The Sanders campaign, which waged an unexpectedly strong challenge to a better-known and better-funded Democrat, has decried what it called Clinton‚Äôs anointment by the party establishment and the media. In an interview taped on Wednesday for broadcast on the NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúTonight‚Äù show on Thursday, Obama said he hoped that divisions between Democrats would start to heal in coming weeks now that Clinton has clinched the party‚Äôs nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. At a fund-raiser in New York City on Wednesday, Obama said he was not too worried about bruised feelings after the primary and said ‚Äúit was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary.‚Äù Obama praised Sanders, the democratic socialist senator from Vermont, for bringing new energy and ideas to the party. ‚ÄúHe pushed the party and challenged them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI thought it made Hillary a better candidate.‚Äù Democrats are striking a delicate balance between the need to unite behind Clinton in the looming battle against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and not alienating Sanders and his supporters.

"Exclusive: Clinton ally Warren weighs potential VP role, sees hurdles - sources","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has considered the idea of serving as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs running mate but sees obstacles to that choice as she prepares to endorse the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, several people familiar with Warren‚Äôs thinking told Reuters. While her thinking could evolve, Warren has concerns about joining a Clinton ticket, including the question of whether running two women would give the Democrats the best shot at defeating Republican Donald Trump, one source said.       Advisers to Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street and a  popular figure among progressive Democrats, have been in close contact with Clinton‚Äôs campaign team and the conversations have increased in frequency in recent weeks, the sources said. Warren has signaled to people close to her that she is intrigued by the possibility of being Clinton‚Äôs No. 2 but has not discussed the role with Clinton, 68, or anyone else from her campaign, the people said.  Warren, 66, has been one of the Democrats‚Äô most outspoken critics of Trump, 69, and her priority is helping to defeat the presumptive Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 presidential election, the sources said.  Warren is also committed to advancing her own political agenda, which they described as ‚Äúmore progressive‚Äù than Clinton‚Äôs more centrist positions. Warren fears that as vice president, or in a cabinet position, her voice could be less heard than it is in the U.S. Senate on her priority issues such as addressing income inequality, the sources said.   In the past, Warren has accused Clinton of abandoning her support for stronger bankruptcy legislation to try to appease Wall Street.  An endorsement of Clinton could come within a week or two, one of the sources said. Clinton has been appealing for Democratic Party unity. On Twitter over the weekend, Warren echoed that call and emphasized the importance of the party coming together to beat Trump. ‚ÄúGet ready, Donald,‚Äù Warren tweeted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming.‚Äù Warren, who represents Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate,   has stayed neutral in the Democratic primary race, notably remaining the only woman senator not throwing her support behind the first woman presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party. Were she to join the Clinton ticket, she could help energize progressives and win over supporters of Clinton‚Äôs rival Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont. Sanders‚Äô calls for reining in Wall Street and breaking up big banks dovetail with Warren‚Äôs views. An ongoing feud with Trump gained steam on social media with a series of posts in which she labeled the celebrity businessman racist, sexist and xenophobic and said she was going to fight to make sure his ‚Äútoxic stew of hatred and insecurity never reaches the White House.‚Äù Warren joined Clinton late last month in criticizing Trump for rooting for the 2008 financial crisis and delivered a 10-minute invective on the subject at an annual Washington gala two weeks ago. ‚ÄúWhat kind of a man roots for people to get thrown out of their house? I‚Äôll tell you exactly what kind of man does that,‚Äù Warren said. ‚ÄúIt is a man who cares about no one but himself - a small insecure money-grubber who doesn‚Äôt care who gets hurt so long as he makes a profit off it.‚Äù Trump has ridiculed Warren by calling her Pocahontas in a mocking reference to her having said in the past that she had Native American ancestry. Pocahontas was a famous Native American in early colonial Virginia. Warren is due to speak to the American Constitution Society, a progressive legal group, on Thursday at a time when Democrats and some Republicans have criticized Trump‚Äôs comments about Mexican-American Judge Gonzalo Curiel.

Wooing Sanders supporters will be tough task for Clinton,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Winning over Bernie Sanders supporters who flocked to his insurgent presidential campaign will be the first and possibly toughest order of business for Hillary Clinton after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee this week. Every time the Vermont senator mentioned Clinton‚Äôs name at a rally in California on Thursday night, his supporters booed as if she was Donald Trump, the Republican businessman who will face off against Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. But Clinton is wasting no time in launching her charm offensive. She called Sanders on Tuesday night, and during a celebratory rally in Brooklyn she praised his candidacy, saying their ‚Äúvigorous debate‚Äù during the nominating contest had been good for the Democratic Party.  Democrats in both camps said they expect to see more specific olive branches offered to Sanders in the weeks ahead, including compromises on the issues platform to be adopted at the party‚Äôs July nominating convention and reforms in a Democratic primary process that Sanders criticized as rigged to favor the establishment. It may not be an easy sell for all of Sander‚Äôs supporters, who have helped catapult him from political obscurity into the national spotlight, cheering his message on income inequality, campaign finance reform and Wall Street excesses. Given little chance a year ago, Sanders earned nearly 10 million votes and won more than 20 states during the nominating process. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in May found Sanders supporters have become increasingly resistant to Clinton in the past few months, with less than half saying they will vote for her if she becomes the party‚Äôs nominee. Last month, 41 percent of Sanders‚Äô supporters said they would vote for Clinton over Trump in the general election. But that was down from 50 percent in April, and 52 percent in March. And some groups supporting Sanders plan to ramp up the pressure on superdelegates, prominent party officials who can vote for any candidate, in the last few weeks before Clinton‚Äôs nomination becomes official at the party convention in Philadelphia.  The people behind the Occupy DNC Convention Facebook group, with around 25,000 members, are creating their own web-based app to contact superdelegates, planning daily emails to urge them to switch to Sanders. Clinton moved to the left to fend off Sanders during the primary battle, opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Asian trade pact, and the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada, voicing support for a higher minimum wage and backing Sanders‚Äô general goals of reining in Wall Street and reducing income inequality. Her best move now to win over progressive voters who backed Sanders would be showing she will stand behind those positions. ‚ÄúOne of the biggest points of skepticism that we hear from Sanders supporters and even lukewarm Clinton supporters is the question of whether she really meant the stuff she said in the primary,‚Äù said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ‚ÄúThe next two weeks are a golden opportunity to make the answer apparent,‚Äù he said, citing her pledges to seek criminal sentences for financial fraud, break up banks¬†that pose economic risks and expand Social Security benefits. Several Democrats said Trump may prove to be the chief motivator for Sanders supporters to switch to Clinton. ‚ÄúTrump has done more than anyone to push the Sanders people toward Clinton for the general election,‚Äù said Brad Anderson, an Iowa-based Democratic strategist who supported Clinton in the primary and said he has seen signs of a shift in the last few weeks. Clinton could make specific concessions or overtures to assuage Sanders, particularly by eliminating the superdelegates from the primary process. Sanders has complained about the involvement of superdelegates, who have heavily backed Clinton. Another easy way to get Sanders‚Äô most passionate supporters on board is to simply hire them, says Democratic strategist Steve Schale. That‚Äôs what Schale, a Florida-based staffer for President Barack Obama‚Äôs 2008 presidential campaign, did once the bitter primary fight between Obama and Clinton ended that year. Florida was crucial to Obama‚Äôs prospects ‚Äî and his campaign need a large operation to work on voter registration, persuasion, and turnout. Clinton could offer Sanders diehards a similar opportunity to stay involved. ‚ÄúFor a lot of these folks, the campaign is as much as social calling as it is a movement,‚Äù he said. While there were concerns in 2008 that Clinton‚Äôs supporters would be too disaffected to support Obama, Clinton endorsed him less than a month after the primary ended and unified the party. Democratic party leaders may also help ease tensions. Sanders will meet on Thursday with Obama and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 "
Judge issues final order upholding Alabama same-sex marriage,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Alabama has issued a permanent injunction barring state officials from denying same-sex couples the right to marry in that state, according to court documents made public on Wednesday.  The order, filed on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Callie Granade, came in response to a 2014 lawsuit challenging Alabama‚Äôs ban on same-sex marriage, finalizing a decision Granade made in early 2015 that the state law was unconstitutional.  The legality of gay marriage was at the center of a national debate until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2015 that the U.S. Constitution provided same-sex couples the right to marry. Despite that order, Alabama officials continued to resist the change in the law.  Last month, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was suspended for issuing an administrative order to state probate judges that they should not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In March, the Alabama Supreme Court dismissed petitions by opponents of same-sex marriage asking to reinstate the ban on those unions but refused to vacate or withdraw its own March 2015 ruling in favor of the same-sex marriage ban, made just months before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. ‚ÄúThis brings a finality by permanently prohibiting Alabama from enforcing its marriage laws which are discriminating against gay couples,‚Äù said Susan Watson, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. ‚ÄúGiven Alabama‚Äôs fierce resistance, this permanent relief was required to ensure marriage equality in the state.‚Äù Officials from the office of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, who is named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.  Strange‚Äôs attorneys had asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed because the state was currently complying with the federal law.  But Granade said in her ruling that ‚Äúpromising to sin no more‚Äù did not render a permanent injunction unnecessary. The actions of the suspended chief justice and other officials suggested that other attempts may be made to undermine the constitutional right of same-sex couples to marry, she wrote. ‚ÄúIt cannot be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that Alabama‚Äôs unconstitutional marriage laws will not again be enforced,‚Äù the order said.

Three teenagers arrested over assaults during California Trump protest,"(Reuters) - Three teenagers were arrested on Wednesday and accused of three separate assaults during a demonstration that turned violent outside a rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump last week in San Jose, California, police said.  The three unidentified juveniles, all males, were accused of taking part in a number of skirmishes between Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators last Thursday outside the San Jose Convention Center. Trump held a rally there in the lead-up to Tuesday‚Äôs California primary for the Republican party‚Äôs presidential nomination. Two of the teenagers, aged 16 and 17, face charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon. The third, also 16, faces a misdemeanor battery charge, the San Jose Police Department said in a statement. One of the teenagers is accused of using a blunt object to strike a victim from behind. The victim suffered visible injuries, according to police.  Four others were arrested during the protests last week. Two 19-year-olds and an 18-year-old face charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon, while another 19-year-old faces a misdemeanor charge of refusal to disperse.  It is unclear whether the seven charged were Trump supporters or among the hundreds of protesters who were seen on news clips waving Mexican flags, chanting anti-Trump slogans, and burning Trump hats and at least one U.S. flag.  Protesters, many angry over Trump‚Äôs comments against illegal immigration, have gathered at his rallies for months. Trump, now the Republican Party‚Äôs presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, canceled a rally in Chicago in March after clashes broke out between his supporters and protesters.

California voting expert bares naked truth about politics,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Political consultants are sometimes accused of hiding the naked truth about the candidates they represent or the campaigns they devise. But California voting expert Paul Mitchell bared it all after Tuesday‚Äôs primary election, running naked around the grounds of the state Capitol building in Sacramento after his prediction in a key race turned out to be wrong. ‚ÄúWhen improbable things happen, some pay consequences,‚Äù Mitchell posted on Twitter early on Wednesday morning. Along with the posting was a photo of the darkened Capitol, a map of a running route from the athletic tracking app Strava and the title, ‚ÄúStreaking.‚Äù Last year, Mitchell firmly dismissed predictions that two Democrats would be chosen in Tuesday‚Äôs primary to vie for the state‚Äôs open U.S. Senate seat in November. He was so sure that would not happen - despite a change in the state‚Äôs open primary law advancing the top two vote-getters to the general election regardless of party affiliation - that he vowed to run naked around the Capitol if two Democrats were chosen.  When it became clear on Tuesday night that state Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez, both Democrats, topped the polls and would advance to the general election, Mitchell knew what he had to do. He parked his car in front of the Capitol building in downtown Sacramento in the darkest spot he could find, took off his clothes (including shoes) and ran, he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.     ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt put up with all the badgering I would get if I didn‚Äôt do it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs honor among politicos, I guess.‚Äù He managed to maintain his privacy to all but a couple of youths on skateboards. ‚ÄúIt really doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs very dark outside when you‚Äôre streaking,‚Äù Mitchell said.

U.S. House Speaker Ryan offers election-year security agenda,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled a national security policy featuring stronger defense on Thursday, the next step in a conservative policy agenda rolling out as he works to unify Republicans after a divisive primary campaign. The plan is sharply critical of President Barack Obama, blaming the Democrat for ‚Äúeight years of broken promises, concessions, and retreat‚Äù in the Syrian civil war, nuclear deal with Iran, chilly relations with Russia and dealings with a bellicose North Korea. It would overturn some of what Obama allies consider his foreign policy achievements, including the Iran deal and his moves toward normal relations with Communist-ruled Cuba. And it criticizes efforts to close the Guantanamo detention center. While not providing figures, it also calls for an end to military rollbacks and demands ‚Äúadequate, predictable budgets.‚Äù The blueprint includes several departures from foreign policy statements by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, whom Ryan has endorsed in the White House race. It does not demand the erection of a massive wall along the Mexican border, a centerpiece of Trump‚Äôs campaigning. Ryan calls for border security measures including ‚Äúhigh fencing,‚Äù aerial surveillance and radar. But it echoes some of Trump‚Äôs concerns about Muslim immigrants, with calls to tighten refugee screening and discussion of ways not to radicalize youths. Trump sparked outrage by promising to temporarily ban Muslims from the United States. ‚ÄúWe must constantly reassess our defenses in order to find and close security gaps so that Islamist militants cannot slip into our country undetected,‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs plan said. The plan is not isolationist. It takes a strong line on battling militants abroad, saying the United States must keep all options on the table and ‚Äúeliminate terrorist sanctuaries.‚Äù  Trump has been critical of some U.S. alliances. Ryan‚Äôs plan, in contrast, underscores the importance of NATO, calls ties to Israel ‚Äúthe cornerstone of stability in the Middle East,‚Äù advocates severe sanctions on Iran and says the United States should stand up to Russian aggression while bolstering Ukraine. It also calls for more trade agreements and says foreign aid programs should make recipient countries self-sufficient. The plan calls for increased security for diplomats and facilities overseas. In that context, it mentions the 2012 attacks on Benghazi, which many Republicans cite to criticize then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump‚Äôs rival in the White House race. Ryan, the country‚Äôs highest-ranking elected Republican, has described the agenda as a way to offer voters a coherent policy message for 2017. He unveiled an anti-poverty agenda on Monday. Initiatives on regulation, constitutional authority, healthcare and tax reform are expected in the coming weeks. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 "
Puerto Rico debt bill cleared for Thursday U.S. House vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation helping Puerto Rico dig out of its $70 billion debt crisis is set for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a House panel fended off attempts to open the bill to a series of controversial amendments. By voice vote on Wednesday, the Rules Committee, the gatekeeper for bills moving through the House, sent the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to the full House for debate and a likely vote on Thursday. The legislation, the result of months of negotiations between Congress and the Obama administration, would create a federal oversight board to work with investors to determine how much they would recover of the island territory‚Äôs $70 billion in loans. Republicans have stressed that no taxpayer money would be used to bail out Puerto Rico from a crisis that has left nearly half of the population in poverty amid closings of schools and hospitals and a contracting economy. During a Rules panel debate that stretched into the night, the committee rejected pleas to allow amendments that would have changed the basic structure of the legislation and the operation of the oversight board. If the bill passes the House, action would move to the Senate, where some leading Democrats have said they would seek significant changes. Earlier on Wednesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop, who ushered the bill through his committee on May 25, told reporters he expected the full House to pass it on Thursday. Bishop, a Utah Republican, said a strong vote for passage in the House would help propel it through the Senate. ‚ÄúThe bottom line is the better the vote here (in the House), the less likely it‚Äôs going to come back in a significantly altered form‚Äù from the Senate, Bishop said. Supporters hope to get it enacted into law before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment that it might not be able to fulfill. The House Rules Committee voted to allow debate on a limited number of amendments, including one giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets. Another amendment expected to be debated would expand a federal program aimed at encouraging economic development in Puerto Rico‚Äôs ‚Äúunder-utilized‚Äù business zones. Representative Raul Grijalva, a senior Democrat who worked on the bill, said Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt crisis, if unaddressed, could grow into a humanitarian crisis. Stabilization measures contained in the bill, he said, ‚Äúwould be the first step toward getting the situation under control.‚Äù But his fellow Democrat, Puerto Rican-born Representative Luis Gutierrez, warned, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think many of my colleagues in this body appreciate just how deeply offensive the bill before us is regarded in Puerto Rico.‚Äù He was particularly concerned with the way control board members would be chosen, with most not having to have any ties to the island. But Gutierrez failed to convince the committee to allow amendments to be offered making changes to the board and its operations. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 "
Obama hopes for quick party healing after 'ouchy' Democratic primary,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he hoped that divisions between Democrats would start to heal in coming weeks, now that his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has clinched the party‚Äôs nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. ‚ÄúMy hope is that over the next couple of weeks we‚Äôre able to pull things together,‚Äù Obama said in his first public remarks since primary election wins on Tuesday in California and elsewhere propelled Clinton to victory over rival Bernie Sanders after a hard-fought, months-long campaign.    ‚ÄúWhat happens during primaries is you get a little ouchy,‚Äù Obama told NBC late-night host Jimmy Fallon during a taping of ‚ÄúThe Tonight Show‚Äù set to air on Thursday. Sanders, who has not conceded the race, is set to meet with Obama at the White House on Thursday at 11:15 a.m. (1515 GMT). Later, at a fundraiser in the Central Park West apartment of Kenneth Lerer, a venture capitalist and chairman of the BuzzFeed medial company, Obama said he was ‚Äúnot too worried‚Äù about ‚Äúbruised feelings‚Äù left over from the primary. ‚ÄúWe just ended - sort of ended - our primary season,‚Äù Obama said, catching his mistake as the crowd of about 60 Democratic donors, who paid up to $33,400 to attend, laughed nervously. ‚ÄúI am concerned about us doing the hard nuts-and-bolts work of turning out people to vote, particularly young people, particularly low-income people,‚Äù Obama said. Asked whether Obama thought Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, should quickly end his campaign, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the senator had ‚Äúmore than earned the right to make his own decision about the course of his campaign.‚Äù The party will officially vote on Clinton‚Äôs nomination at its convention in Philadelphia at the end of July. Obama told Fallon that ‚Äúit was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary‚Äù and praised Sanders for the ‚Äúenormous energy and new ideas‚Äù he brought to the campaign. ‚ÄúHe pushed the party and challenged them. I thought it made Hillary a better candidate,‚Äù Obama said. The White House has said Obama, who is very popular among Democrats, will play a unifying role on the campaign trail. ‚ÄúThe main role I‚Äôm going to be playing in this process is to remind the American people that this is a serious job. This is not reality TV,‚Äù Obama told Fallon in a swipe at presumptive Republican nominee and real estate magnate Donald Trump, who starred in a reality television show.

New York mayor strives to stay the course as probe queries persist,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corruption charges against a union leader and a financier¬†stemming from state and federal investigations that include an examination of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio‚Äôs campaign fundraising practices are casting a cloud over his office and could possibly complicate his re-election bid. The arrests on Wednesday of the head of New York City‚Äôs prison guard union and a hedge fund financier accused of orchestrating a bribery scheme involving union retirement and operating funds were the first to emerge from the probes. Although the charges were not linked to de Blasio, who won a landslide victory in 2013, the case is the first major prosecution to emerge from several overlapping state and federal corruption probes examining de Blasio‚Äôs fundraising practices, among other avenues of inquiry.  David Birdsell, dean of the Baruch College School of Public Affairs, said on Wednesday the investigations were ‚Äúkeeping him off message,‚Äù noting that de Blasio was on occasion having to avoid the press because of incessant questions. On Wednesday his office said the investigations were not distracting the mayor. ‚ÄúNew Yorkers will vote for the candidate who gets things done for their families and communities,‚Äù said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for de Blasio. ‚ÄúThat person is Mayor de Blasio.‚Äù Still, there is evidence that the investigations are affecting the mayor‚Äôs standing, Birdsell said.  If they drag on and raise more questions they will not only be a distraction for the mayor but possibly encourage a challenge from his own party.  ‚ÄúRight now people smell some blood in the water,‚Äù Birdsell said. He said if the mayor becomes directly implicated in the investigations it would turn a contested Democratic primary mayoral race next year into a certainty from a likelihood. On Wednesday at a public appearance, de Blasio reiterated that he was ‚Äúabsolutely comfortable that we have done things properly.‚Äù He has said his administration committed no wrongdoing and is cooperating fully with investigators. In April, de Blasio‚Äôs office received subpoenas from state and federal prosecutors pursuing coordinated corruption probes that extended from City Hall to the police department. News of the subpoenas came days after a leaked January report from the state Board of Elections accusing the mayor and others of intentionally evading campaign finance contribution limits in 2014. The mayor‚Äôs counsel said at the time de Blasio had not been personally served. The once popular de Blasio, who struck a cord with New Yorkers after 12 years of Michael Bloomberg‚Äôs mayoralty, has seen his approval rating fall to a new low in May, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  De Blasio will be up for re-election in 2017. The latest poll, conducted in the first week of June among 600 likely Democratic mayoral primary voters and published on Wednesday, showed 38 percent believed de Blasio deserved reelection while 43 percent said he did not.¬†  The poll was conducted by NYC Deserves Better, a group formed by Bradley Tusk, a businessman and former campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg who wants a new mayor to be elected. The poll found that in a potential match up, de Blasio was neck-and-neck with City Comptroller Scott Stringer.¬†¬†  However, the poll also found that 51 percent had a ‚Äòvery positive‚Äô or ‚Äòsomewhat positive‚Äô opinion of the mayor, and 32 percent had a ‚Äòsomewhat negative‚Äô or ‚Äòvery negative‚Äô opinion. De Blasio brushed off questions about the poll and said he was committed to focusing on the job.  ‚ÄúPolls come and go. They go up. They go down. They don‚Äôt always reflect what happens in elections,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI believe fundamentally that the goal is to do the work, do it well ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 "
Ohio governor signs bill legalizing medical marijuana,"(Reuters) - Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich on Wednesday signed a bill legalizing marijuana use for medical purposes under certain circumstances, his office said. Over the last few years, state legislatures and voters in the United States have been much more receptive to making marijuana legal for medical purposes, and to a lesser extent, recreational use. The Ohio legislature approved the measure in May. Some 24 states and Washington D.C. currently allow some type of medical marijuana use, and just a handful of states allow its recreational use. It remains illegal on the federal level. Kasich, who earlier this year dropped out of the U.S. presidential race, signed the bill but provided no statement on Wednesday.  The Ohio legislation only allows patients with specific medical conditions to use an oil, edible, tincture or vapor form of marijuana prescribed by a physician licensed in the state, starting in 2017. Medical marijuana users would not be allowed to smoke or grow their own marijuana under the measure, which also would create a commission responsible for regulating and licensing of all operations of the drug. The measure was fast-tracked to head off a possible less-restrictive medical marijuana ballot initiative in November. Ohioans for Medical Marijuana suspended their campaign for the ballot measure late last month, saying that while the lawmakers‚Äô bill had its shortcomings, it was ‚Äúa moderately good piece of legislation.‚Äù Last November, Ohio voters soundly rejected a measure that would have made it the first U.S. Midwestern state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. The proposal was criticized for allowing the main backers of the proposal cartel-like powers over the industry in the state for several years. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 "
New York City reaches agreement on $82.1 billion FY 2017 budget,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York‚Äôs Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Wednesday an agreement on a balanced $82.1 billion city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year that boosts reserves and expands a summer youth employment program.  The agreement was reached with New York‚Äôs City Council and comes well ahead of a July 1 deadline. De Blasio, a Democrat, said it was the earliest agreement since 2001 and credited the cooperation between his administration and the City Council. The agreement increases reserves, with an additional $250 million to grow the Retiree Health Benefits Trust Fund to $3.9 billion. It includes $1 billion every year in general reserves, and $500 million in the capital stabilization reserve. The budget highlights de Blasio‚Äôs social mission. The executive budget, presented in April, dedicated $2 billion to overhauling the city‚Äôs $7.5 billion public hospital system, which treat around 1.4 million people per year. City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and other council members hailed the expansion of the city‚Äôs summer youth work program to 60,000 at a press conference at City Hall. The program places young people aged 14-24 with community organizations for summer employment. The budget agreement comes at a difficult time for de Blasio who is facing multiple investigations into his campaign finances.

"Clinton, Trump draw battle lines for ill-tempered campaign fight","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump kicked off a fierce general election battle, with Democrats accusing Trump of erratic behavior and the Republican threatening to bring up old Clinton scandals.            Clinton, the former secretary of state, made history when she became the first woman to lead a major political party in its quest to capture the U.S. presidency. Big primary election wins on Tuesday in California and elsewhere catapulted her to victory over Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders. If elected on Nov. 8, the 68-year-old former U.S. senator from New York would return the Clinton family to the White House 16 years after her husband, Bill Clinton, completed two terms as president. All signs point toward a negative campaign as Clinton accused Trump of being temperamentally unfit to serve and the New York businessman charged that Clinton had a dark past and a weak record as President Barack Obama‚Äôs first-term secretary of state. Clinton told NBC on Wednesday she would not run a ‚Äúcampaign of insults,‚Äù but she sought to portray the 69-year-old Trump as not fit for the Oval Office after the real estate developer repeatedly accused a Mexican-American judge of showing bias against him because of his ethnic heritage. The Clinton campaign has pointed to criticism from leaders in Trump‚Äôs Republican Party to make this case. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to talk about why he‚Äôs unqualified to be president based on his own words and his deeds. And I‚Äôm going to continue to make the case he is temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief,‚Äù she said in the interview. Trump gave a carefully crafted primary race victory speech on Tuesday laying out his own plan of attack. To keep from straying off message, he used a Teleprompter and avoided his typical stream-of-consciousness delivery. Trump said money given to the Clinton Foundation charity from foreign donors had earned the Clintons millions of dollars and had a corrupting influence when Clinton was secretary of state. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund - the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese - all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return. It‚Äôs a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens,‚Äù Trump said.     He said he would give a speech next week ‚Äúdiscussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.‚Äù  A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed Clinton leading Trump by 10 percentage points nationally, little changed from a week earlier. [nL1N18Y1Z2] Both Clinton and Trump must unite their parties but the Democrat appeared to face the easier path with Sanders, a leftist U.S. senator from Vermont, nearly out of options to challenge her.  Trump has an uphill battle. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan described Trump‚Äôs remarks about the judge as a ‚Äútextbook definition of a racist comment,‚Äù but said he would still support him. Trump said on Wednesday he was ‚Äúdisappointed and surprised‚Äù by charges of racism from Republicans.  ‚ÄúI had just won more votes than anyone in the history of the party,‚Äù he told Time. ‚ÄúBut you know, they have to say what they have to say. I‚Äôm a big boy. They have to say what they have to say.‚Äù     Ryan met behind closed doors on Wednesday with House Republicans. An aide said Ryan ‚Äúdiscussed with his members the thinking behind his endorsement (of Trump) and how to move forward‚Äù and reiterated he had confidence Trump would support the House Republican agenda.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say the general attitude is, ‚ÄòGood. Now let‚Äôs just move on,‚Äô‚Äù said U.S. Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Trump supporter. ‚ÄúThe irony here and the frustration was that he‚Äôs not racist.‚Äù Others said Trump needed to stop engaging in petty battles with former rivals and build a fundraising organization. Trump will meet on Thursday in New York with top fundraisers of the Republican National Committee, a party official said. Hopes flickered among some anti-Trump Republicans that there would be a revolt against him when delegates convene to nominate him formally in Cleveland from July 18 to 21.  Representative Morgan Griffith, a Virginia Republican, said that was unlikely but that Trump needed to improve as a candidate. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt step into the cow pie,‚Äù Griffith said. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt afford to be stepping into any more controversies like that.‚Äù Clinton edged Sanders out in a rough-and-tumble battle that stretched over four months and 50 states. She won support, especially among older voters, with a more pragmatic campaign focused on building on the policies of fellow Democrat Obama. Clinton said she had spoken to Sanders on Tuesday to congratulate him on his campaign. ‚ÄúI am looking forward to working with him to unify the Democratic Party against the threat that Donald Trump poses to our country,‚Äù she told PBS on Wednesday. ‚ÄúSo we are talking. We will be having an opportunity to discuss in greater detail in the days ahead how we can best work together.‚Äù     Democratic Party elites are lined up squarely behind Clinton, including most likely Obama, who may endorse her as early as this week. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama would not endorse until after he meets with Sanders on Thursday. Obama and Sanders have spoken three times in the past month, Earnest said. The president‚Äôs eventual endorsement would put pressure on Sanders to exit graciously and throw his support to Clinton. Sanders is also due to meet with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 "

Pennsylvania is one of just two U.S. states, along with Utah, with full control over its liquor sale system - owning and operating retail and wholesale operations. ‚ÄúThis is truly a historic day for Pennsylvania and the most significant step the commonwealth has taken to reform our liquor system in 80 years,‚Äù Wolf said in a statement. The new legislation, passed by lawmakers on Tuesday, moves wine sales beyond the state‚Äôs publicly run system, allowing supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants and hotels that already have licenses for carry-out beer to sell up to four bottles of wine to customers. [nL1N18Z1W7] It also expands direct wine shipments by the case; liquor, wine and beer sales at casinos; and hours of operation at state stores, including on Sundays. The move is expected to increase retail wine sales overall and could add more than $150 million to state coffers. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is the largest purchaser of wine and spirits in the United States. The state has an 18 percent liquor tax. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 "
Modi wants deeper U.S.-India security relationship,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a closer security relationship between his country and the United States on Wednesday, in an address to the U.S. Congress stressing the importance of warming ties between the two countries. He dedicated much of the speech to the importance of fighting terrorism, thanking Congress for U.S. support after a Pakistan-based military group‚Äôs rampage in Mumbai killed 166 people in 2008. ‚ÄúThe fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels. And the traditional tools of military, intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight,‚Äù Modi told a rare joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives. ‚ÄúWe have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating it. The need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation,‚Äù Modi said. He leavened the speech to lawmakers, the first such address by an international leader since Pope Francis‚Äô in September, with jokes about Congress‚Äô bitter partisan divide and yoga. But Modi used it to make serious points about India‚Äôs neighbor and arch-rival Pakistan and regional concerns about Chinese expansionism. ‚ÄúI commend the members of the U.S. Congress for sending a clear message to those who preach and practice terrorism for political gains,‚Äù he said, not mentioning either country by name.     Modi is on the U.S. leg of an international tour. On Tuesday, he met with President Barack Obama at the White House, where the two leaders said India agreed to work toward joining the Paris Agreement on climate change this year and discussed security and cyber security issues. The visit, two years after Modi became prime minister, capped an improving relationship between New Delhi and the United States. Before he was elected, Modi was barred from even entering the country because of concerns about his handling of 2002 riots that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Today, he is one of the international leaders most popular in Washington, where Modi‚Äôs government is seen as a counterbalance to China. He and Obama have a warm personal relationship. ‚ÄúWe are now standing shoulder to shoulder in ways that no one could have imagined a generation ago,‚Äù Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs committee, said at a reception for Modi after the address.  In a 45-minute speech interrupted by cheers and at least eight standing ovations, the 65-year-old Indian leader said deeper U.S.-Indian security cooperation should isolate anyone who harbors, supports or sponsors terrorists. Although he did not mention Pakistan, that line was greeted with applause from the lawmakers, many of whom are increasingly frustrated with what they see as Islamabad‚Äôs failure to crack down on militants behind attacks on American troops in Afghanistan. Modi also stressed that India is committed to helping rebuild a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. Amid heightened tensions over China‚Äôs assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea, Modi said a stronger U.S.-India partnership could boost peace and prosperity ‚Äúfrom Asia to Africa and from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific.‚Äù He did not mention China. ‚ÄúIt can also help ensure security of the sea lanes and commerce and freedom of navigation on seas,‚Äù Modi added. Democrats leaped to their feet when Modi referred to the recent climate change summit. But Republicans in the House chamber remained seated, reflecting the U.S. political divide over the issue. House Speaker Paul Ryan greeted Modi at his office before his speech. After the Indian leader‚Äôs remarks, he attended lunch with congressional leaders and a reception with members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees.

Two gay men challenge Tennessee denial of service law,"(Reuters) - Two men have filed a lawsuit against Tennessee and its governor saying their constitutional rights as gay individuals are violated by a new law that allows mental health counselors to refuse to treat patients on the basis of ‚Äúsincerely held principles.‚Äù The law, signed by Republican Governor Bill Haslam in April, has been criticized as discriminatory against the gay community. The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday by Bleu Copas and Caleb Laieski in the Chancery Court for Anderson County, asks the court to void the statute because it violates the Tennessee Constitution and the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens under the law. ‚ÄúLGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) persons were the target of the statute. They are singled out for discriminatory treatment. There is no other group which could conceivably be the target of the statute,‚Äù the lawsuit reads in part. A court employee sent Reuters a copy of the complaint on Wednesday via email. Jennifer Donnals, press secretary for Governor Haslam, said in an emailed statement: ‚ÄúWe are not able to make comments on pending litigation.‚Äù The law protects therapists and counselors from legal action when they cite their personal principles in refusing service, despite a provision in the American Counseling Association‚Äôs code of ethics barring members from such denials of service. In the lawsuit, Copas says he is a homosexual man and a resident of Anderson County, Tennessee, while Laieski says he is homosexual and describes himself as a national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights activist residing in Alexandria, Virginia. With gay marriage becoming a lost cause for opponents - the Supreme Court ruled in June that same-sex couples have the right to marry - a new battleground has become a quest by conservatives in some states to allow people to refuse services to gay men and women on religious grounds. tinyurl.com/hj29fs9 The Tennessee law is among a number of state statutes passed over the last year or so, prohibiting sanctions against businesses, service providers, professionals or clerics who refuse service, in some cases to same-sex couples or in other cases to individuals, based on profoundly held beliefs. Some states, such as Arkansas and Indiana, enacted fixes to the measures after large companies and rights groups assailed them as discriminatory. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 "

Former Reagan aide helped write Trump foreign policy speech,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former senior official in the Reagan administration and prominent Republican foreign policy insider told Reuters he provided input for the late-April foreign policy speech by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. ‚ÄúI was asked to contribute material‚Äù for Trump‚Äôs April 27 speech at the Center for the National Interest, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said Richard Burt. Burt said he is not part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. ‚ÄúBut I am happy to talk to people looking for advice on foreign policy issues,‚Äù said Burt, a managing director of McLarty Associates, a Washington-based consulting firm co-founded by former President Bill Clinton‚Äôs White House chief of staff and counselor Thomas ‚ÄúMack‚Äù McLarty. Burt said he also would be willing to offer foreign policy advice to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, if she asked for such advice, though he added, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not going to.‚ÄùBurt is also chairman of Global Zero, an independent group devoted to ridding the world of nuclear weapons. Trump told The New York Times in April that he was not sure it would be ‚Äúa bad thing‚Äù for the United States if Japan had nuclear weapons, and has said the same about South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Burt said the main theme he talked about to Trump was the need for the United States to pursue a ‚Äúmore realist foreign policy,‚Äù in which the United States would avoid seeking ‚Äúregime change‚Äù abroad, and instead make protecting the United States and its interests the main policy goal. Trump, who became the Republican‚Äôs presumptive nominee last month after the last of his challengers dropped from the party‚Äôs race, articulated this theme again in a campaign speech late on Tuesday, as he claimed victory in the last Republican nominating contests. Under Reagan, Burt headed the State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and then its European and Canadian Affairs bureau and served as U.S. ambassador to Germany from 1985 to 1989. Some of Burt‚Äôs contemporaries from the administrations of Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, have publicly denounced Trump‚Äôs foreign policy views or remained mute. Earlier this year, Trump met with a group of 11 foreign policy advisers, headed by Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Trump‚Äôs most outspoken supporters.  Reuters sought comment on the recent activities of Trump‚Äôs foreign policy team from several of its members and from a campaign spokeswoman. Most declined to comment, and the campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  One campaign team member, who asked for anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly, said that while the team had held several discussions since Trump‚Äôs speech, the candidate remains his own most important foreign policy adviser.

Senator Tim Kaine an online favorite to run with Clinton,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia has emerged as the online betting favorite to be presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs running mate while Bernie Sanders‚Äô chances have slipped, online predictions market PredictIt said. Kaine topped a list of potential vice president candidates with about 20 percent probability, followed by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts with about 17 percent and U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez with about 14 percent. The website, which allows users to wager small amounts of money, said Sanders‚Äô chances of joining Clinton‚Äôs race for the White House were about 10 percent. Big election wins on Tuesday catapulted Clinton to victory over Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, although he has vowed to go on contesting the race. Bets on Clinton winning the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election were going for 66 cents while bets on Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominees, were traded at just 33 cents. On the Republican side, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama was leading the race to be Trump‚Äôs running mate at 20 percent, followed by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa at 17 percent, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at 15 percent and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie at 9 percent. The latest opinion poll by Reuters/Ipsos on Tuesday showed Trump trails Clinton by 10 points in the 2016 presidential campaign, showing little change from a week ago.    The online survey had 44.3 percent of likely voters saying they would vote for Clinton, compared with 34.7 percent who would support Trump.

"'Hi Donald, we're Muslims!' Scottish offer to teach Trump in visit","EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scottish Muslims have invited Donald Trump to visit a mosque and learn about their faith during his visit to Scotland this month in the hope of changing his views. The presumptive Republican U.S. presidential candidate, whose mother was Scottish, last year proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States as a response to Islamist attacks in Paris and California, causing a furor in Europe. Accepting a visit to learn about the Muslim community might help show that he is not so extreme, Edinburgh Central Mosque Imam Yayha Barry told Reuters. ‚ÄúI would say: ‚ÄòHi Donald, we‚Äôre Muslims, welcome to our mosque! Do you still see Muslims as a threat to Western civilizations?‚Äô‚Äù he said. Trump‚Äôs views prompted widespread opposition in Britain, where he owns two golf courses on the west and east Scottish coasts. His comments about stopping Mexican migrants entering the United States also caused offense, leading to the withdrawal of Scottish business and academic accolades.  Prime Minister David Cameron said the remarks by the potential leader of Britain‚Äôs closest international ally were ‚Äúdivisive, stupid and wrong‚Äù.  Neither Cameron nor Scotland‚Äôs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon plan to meet him on his visit, which coincides with the result of Britain‚Äôs referendum on EU membership on June 24.  Spiritual leaders in the Islamic community invited Trump to ‚Äúlearn more about the Muslims that he offends‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe would welcome the opportunity to show him the work that we are doing in the community in Edinburgh when he comes to Scotland,‚Äù said Hafiz Ghafoor of Annandale Mosque and Munawar Hussain, secretary of Roxburgh St Mosque and Islamic Centre, in a joint statement. Trump‚Äôs relationship with Scotland has been rocky since he contested a decision to build an offshore wind farm opposite his golf course in Aberdeenshire. His trip will include a visit there as well as to his courses at Turnberry, in southwestern Scotland, and Doonbeg, in Ireland. Protests at Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúmisogynist, racist and xenophobic‚Äù views are planned by Aberdeen University students during his visit, the president of the Students‚Äô Association said.  A spokesperson for the Trump Organisation did not respond to a request to comment.  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Trump should witness first hand the work being done by local Muslims to reach across faiths and help those in need. ‚ÄúMuslims are our friends, colleagues, family and neighbors.

Sanders plants seeds for a lasting U.S. progressive movement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders‚Äô upstart U.S. presidential campaign may be headed to defeat, but his goals of reining in Wall Street, ending big money in politics and eradicating income inequality were the big winners in the bruising Democratic race. Sanders, who started as a little-known long-shot, pushed the party and established front-runner Hillary Clinton sharply to the left during a long primary battle. Along the way, the 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont energized young and progressive voters and prepared the ground for what his allies predict will be a lasting influence on the party. Clinton, one of the best-known political figures in the United States, clinched the Democratic Party‚Äôs nomination in a last round of state nominating contests on Tuesday.  But even before her victory, Sanders began taking steps to turn his newfound political influence into an enduring progressive movement. In the last few weeks, he has lent his influence and fundraising power to progressive congressional and state legislative candidates who share his agenda, urging his supporters around the country to donate to their campaigns. Sanders also appointed prominent activists to the panel writing the issues platform for the party‚Äôs convention in July, ensuring a strong voice in the process. His convention delegates will push for changes to party primary rules, including letting independents vote in primaries and reducing the influence of superdelegates, the hundreds of party elites who can support any candidate regardless of voting in their constituencies, and who in this primary season have largely backed Clinton. ‚ÄúI do think we are going to see real changes in the Democratic Party going forward because of Bernie. The future of the party is with the people supporting Sanders,‚Äù said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, a liberal Vermont-based group that rose from Howard Dean‚Äôs failed 2004 presidential bid and endorsed Sanders this time. ‚ÄúHe has proven the power of this message,‚Äù Chamberlain said. During the campaign, Sanders forced Clinton to tack left repeatedly on issues ranging from her support for a higher minimum wage to her opposition to the Asian trade pact and Keystone XL oil pipeline. Sanders‚Äô progressive allies said those shifts by Clinton will be helpful in the Nov. 8 election against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has touted an anti-trade and pro-jobs economic agenda, and for Democrats in their efforts to recapture a majority in the U.S. Senate. ‚ÄúWhen the story of the 2016 election is told, a major part of it will be that Bernie Sanders helped the Democratic Party turn up the volume on economic populism issues,‚Äù said Adam Green, co-founder of the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee. If Democrats win back the Senate in the November election, Sanders will be in line for either the chairmanship of the Budget Committee or the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, both powerful platforms to advance his ideas. Chamberlain said Sanders would create a formidable one-two  punch in the Senate with Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator who has been the leader of the party‚Äôs progressive wing. ‚ÄúBernie Sanders is going to fight all the good fights,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWith Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren we‚Äôre going to see a Senate team that will be very powerful.‚Äù Sanders‚Äô investment in the next generation of progressive politicians, meanwhile, is aimed at spawning a new generation of liberals who back his agenda. He has sent emails to his grassroots fundraising list urging his donors to back six insurgent congressional candidates and eight statehouse candidates who echo his economic message, sparking a flood of donations to their campaigns. More endorsements are expected. ‚ÄúOur movement is so powerful that we can change congressional elections overnight. Let‚Äôs keep going,‚Äù Sanders said on Tuesday in an email to supporters asking them to support two more candidates for Congress - Eric Kingson in New York and Paul Clements in Michigan. Justin Bamberg, a first-term state representative from South Carolina, said he received about $70,000 in small-dollar donations after Sanders sent an email to his supporters backing Bamberg. In Bamberg‚Äôs first campaign, he raised $21,000 during the entire cycle, he said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know me from Adam, but they believe in Senator Sanders, and because of that they believe in the people that Senator Sanders has supported,‚Äù Bamberg said, adding he was also getting calls offering to volunteer on his behalf. Terry Alexander, a South Carolina state representative backed by Sanders, said he also had received about $70,000 in donations after the Sanders email. The money freed him from worrying about raising funds, giving him more time to focus on meeting voters, he said. ‚ÄúIt has made a difference in how people see my candidacy, it‚Äôs created a lot of enthusiasm and a tremendous boost in fundraising,‚Äù he said.

California poised to shut out Republicans from U.S. Senate race,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California voters on Tuesday were poised to choose two Democrats to face off against each other in the race to succeed Barbara Boxer in the U.S. Senate, shutting out Republicans in a sign of diminished support in America‚Äôs most populous state. State Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez will meet in what would be the state‚Äôs first single-party Senate election under a 2010 California law advancing the top two primary vote-getters to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. With 16 percent of precincts reporting in early returns on Tuesday, Harris, 51, led the crowded field of 34 candidates with 40 percent of the vote. None of the Republican contenders came close to Sanchez, 56, who was firmly in second place with 16  percent of the vote. Boxer, 75, a Democrat, is retiring after 24 years in the Senate. Republicans hold no statewide offices in California and represent about 27 percent of registered voters. The state, home to former Republican Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, last elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1988. On Tuesday, former California Republican Party chairman Duf Sundheim was in third place with 10 percent in early returns, followed by fellow Republican Phil Wyman with 6 percent.       Harris is the daughter of two college professors. Of African-American and Indian descent, she was raised amid civil rights activism in Berkeley and Oakland, eventually becoming a prosecutor in San Francisco. She was elected attorney general in 2010 and 2014. For the primary, Harris ran a tightly controlled campaign, touting her role negotiating a settlement with big banks over the mortgage meltdown and using her position as the state‚Äôs top prosecutor to fight human trafficking, cyber crime and other issues. Sanchez, who represents Orange County near Los Angeles, has served in Congress since 1997. Her win in the once staunchly Republican county was an early sign of California‚Äôs demographic shift, as the state became more ethnically diverse and far more Democratic. Such a matchup could easily go negative, experts said, straining relationships within a party that are already bruised by the tense competition between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Clinton and Sanders also face off in California on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe fact that they‚Äôre both in the same party doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to treat each other with kid gloves,‚Äù political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said of Harris and Sanchez. ‚ÄúWhen ideological and policy differences aren‚Äôt as great, it‚Äôs only natural for the candidates to focus on personal issues,‚Äù said Dan Schnur, who heads the Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. Sanchez, seeking to become the state‚Äôs first Latina U.S. senator, has raised less money than Harris and trails her by about 8 percentage points in polls. But factors including a recent surge in voter registration among Latinos will make her a strong competitor in the general election, analysts said. She has positioned herself more to the political center than her opponent. With support from Latinos, independents and Republicans, Sanchez could win in November despite Harris‚Äô advantages, Schnur said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre prepared for any turn in the race,‚Äù said Harris spokesman Nathan Click. A Sanchez campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 "

"Under fire from Republicans, Trump says he'll stop talking about judge","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bowing to pressure from fellow Republicans, Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would no longer talk about a Mexican-American judge after U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the presidential candidate‚Äôs criticism of the jurist as textbook racism. But Trump refused entreaties from party leaders to disavow his charge that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was showing bias because of his Mexican heritage and should recuse himself from a lawsuit alleging fraud at Trump‚Äôs defunct Trump University real estate training school. Trump said in a statement that his previous remarks about Curiel had been misconstrued. ‚ÄúI do not feel that one‚Äôs heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial,‚Äù the presumptive Republican nominee said. Trump added that he did not plan to comment further on the matter. Trump had been suggesting that Curiel‚Äôs heritage was influencing the judge‚Äôs opinion about the case because of Trump‚Äôs campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Trump has pledged to seal the U.S.-Mexico border with a wall, and has said Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States. Ryan, the country‚Äôs top elected Republican, blasted Trump‚Äôs comments, which have threatened to disrupt Republicans‚Äô already rocky efforts to unite behind the candidate. ‚ÄúI regret those comments that he made. Claiming a person can‚Äôt do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. I think that should be absolutely disavowed,‚Äù Ryan told reporters. The controversy over Trump‚Äôs attacks on the judge has set back his efforts to try to unify the Republican party behind him ahead of the Nov. 8 general election when he will face off against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Speaking to supporters at the golf club he owns in the hilly suburbs of New York later on Tuesday, Trump laid out his vision for the meaning of his campaign slogan ‚ÄúAmerica First,‚Äù talking about its implications for trade, energy, financial regulation and tax policies. Breaking with his usual practice of speaking off the cuff, Trump read from a teleprompter and left without taking questions from reporters. Ryan, who endorsed Trump last week after initial misgivings, said he still supported his candidacy, saying Trump would be preferable to Clinton. Behind the scenes, Trump has been pressured from friends and family to back down, fearful of the damage that may be done to his prospects in the general election, a source close to the Trump campaign said. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a potential Trump vice presidential running mate, was spotted at Trump Tower in New York before Trump‚Äôs statement was issued. Christie earlier in the day defended Trump as ‚Äúnot a racist.‚Äù ‚ÄúSome of his friends and family have talked to him and asked him to drop it and so far he won‚Äôt do it,‚Äù the source said, speaking before Trump‚Äôs statement was issued. ‚ÄúEverybody is mystified about why he would keep doing it.‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs emphatic rejection of Trump‚Äôs comments showed anxiety among party leaders about their ability to hang on to control of the U.S. Congress in November if voters trounce Trump and also punish candidates for other offices on the Republican ticket. Ryan‚Äôs counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said Trump should stop attacking minority groups. ‚ÄúMy advice to our nominee is to start talking about the issues that the American people care about, and to start doing it now,‚Äù the Senate Republican leader told reporters. ‚ÄúIn addition to that, it‚Äôs time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message.‚Äù Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican who said back in March he would support whoever turned out to be the Republican nominee, said on Tuesday he could not support Trump because he did not have the ‚Äútemperament necessary‚Äù for the White House. Kirk condemned Trump‚Äôs comments on Curiel as ‚Äúdead wrong‚Äù and ‚Äúun-American.‚Äù Kirk is seeking re-election in November. During the Republican primary campaigns, in which Trump vanquished 16 opponents with a stream of insults to rivals and inflammatory comments about Muslims, immigrants and women, establishment Republicans squirmed over the prospect of the former reality television host becoming their standard-bearer. But many, seeing no alternative, have reconciled themselves to a Trump run for the White House. Trump‚Äôs continuing practice of making explosive remarks about racial, religious and gender issues is making Republicans, including those who have embraced him, uncomfortable. With greater scrutiny of Trump now that he is set to formally win the Republican presidential nomination at the party‚Äôs July convention in Cleveland, there are concerns about the party‚Äôs ability to maintain control of the House of Representatives and Senate. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs continuing missteps, punctuated by his outrageous and indefensible comments about Judge Curiel, make that goal much more difficult to achieve,‚Äù said Lanhee Chen, a senior adviser to former presidential candidate Marco Rubio and a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution.

Trump lawyers channel Obama in court filing,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When lawyers for Donald Trump asked a court to throw out one of the proposed class actions over Trump University, they backed it up with a financial disclosure meant to bolster the Republican presidential candidate‚Äôs credentials as a global businessman. But the form they filed with the court was actually that of the man Trump hopes to succeed in the White House, Democratic President Barack Obama. The president‚Äôs nine-page disclosure filed before his 2012 re-election was erroneously included as an exhibit to a motion Trump filed in April asking U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel for the Southern District of California to toss the case before trial, according to a person familiar with the case. A corrected exhibit was filed on Tuesday.  Plaintiffs‚Äô lawyer Jason Forge seized on the goof in a court document filed late on Friday opposing Trump‚Äôs motion. Forge said the candidate‚Äôs filing was meant for a court in ‚ÄúBizarro world.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis is just one example of Trump‚Äôs statement‚Äôs complete lack of credibility,‚Äù Forge said. Julie Fei, a spokeswoman for O‚ÄôMelveny & Myers, the firm that has been representing Trump in the case, declined to comment. In court filings, Trump‚Äôs lawyers said the form supported the ‚Äúundisputed fact‚Äù that Trump is chairman, president and chief executive of the Trump Organization, which conducts business around the world and is affiliated with over 500 companies. Instead, it showed Obama‚Äôs royalties from his memoir ‚ÄúDreams from My Father‚Äù and disclosed the first family‚Äôs 2011 assets of between $2.6 million and $8.3 million. Trump is facing two lawsuits in California and one in New York over Trump University that allege the series of real estate seminars taught students nothing and defrauded them of as much as $35,000 each in fees. The presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election has raised the litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated, and accusing the Indiana-born Curiel of being biased against him because of his Mexican ancestry.  Trump‚Äôs lawyers intended to file the 92-page financial disclosure form he made public last summer at the time he announced he was running for president. That lists some $1.4 billion in assets, including real estate and other holdings, and $265 million in liabilities. The disclosure does not note his net worth, which he has said is over $10 billion.

Trump criticizes GM for Mexico investments,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump rebuked General Motors Co (GM.N) on Tuesday, widening his criticism of American companies that have invested in Mexico. Trump has made criticism of Ford Motor Co (F.N) a staple of his campaign speeches for more than a year, repeatedly suggesting that the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker would back down from plans to expand in Mexico or face a 35 percent tariff on vehicle exports. Trump also has criticized Carrier, a manufacturer of air conditioning units, which is owned by United Technologies Corp and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the owner of Nabisco, for shifting jobs to Mexico. ‚ÄúI am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies ‚Äì like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier ‚Äì are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage,‚Äù Trump said in a statement defending his comments about a Mexican-American judge overseeing civil lawsuits against Trump University. His view of an ethnically biased judiciary has drawn criticism, including from within his own party.  A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why Trump had decided to criticize GM. GM spokesman Jim Cain declined comment on Trump‚Äôs criticism. In December 2014, GM said it was investing $5 billion in Mexico through 2018 - a move that would allow it to double its production capacity at its plants around the country. GM said in 2014 the investment would create 5,600 jobs in Mexico. The Detroit News reported in May that GM plans next year to move some light-duty pickup production to the Flint Assembly Plant from Mexico, according to a memo from UAW Local 598 to membership. Mexican auto production has been rising in recent years as numerous automakers expand operations. Mexico produced 3.4 million vehicles in 2015, the seventh largest vehicle producer worldwide, and could surpass South Korea by 2020, producing more than 5 million vehicles, according to industry forecasts. Ford has repeatedly rejected Trump‚Äôs criticism and emphasized its significant U.S. investments and employment. In April, Ford announced it would invest $1.6 billion to build more small cars in Mexico. In 2015, Ford said it would invest $2.5 billion in new engine and transmission plants in Mexico, creating 3,800 jobs. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 "
Congress approves bill updating chemical safety oversight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that would revamp federal chemical safety protections for the first time in decades, sending it to President Barack Obama for his expected signing into law. The Senate approved the measure that was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives on May 25. The bill would update the Toxic Substances Control Act amid complaints that its 40-year-old provisions hobble the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from effectively regulating chemicals, including those ranging from asbestos and flame retardants to everyday household products. ‚ÄúNo one disputes that this bill transfers power from the states to the federal government,‚Äù Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky complained during debate of the bill. He said it would add hundreds of new regulations that will burden the U.S. chemical industry and hurt jobs. The EPA, under the bill, would have to consider the impact of a chemical on human health and the environment, as well as the chemical‚Äôs benefits and the economic impact of regulation.

White House threatens to veto Senate defense bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House threatened on Tuesday to veto a Senate defense policy bill, saying it would prevent President Barack Obama from closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and limit the size of his National Security Council. ‚ÄúThe bill would undermine expert judgments of the (Defense) Department‚Äôs civilian and military leadership and constrain the ability of the president and the secretary of defense to appropriately manage and direct the nation‚Äôs defense,‚Äù the White House said in a statement. The $602 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, sets spending policy for the Pentagon each year. The Republican-led Congress generally uses the must-pass bill as a vehicle for a range of policy measures. The Senate Armed Services Committee passed the bill last month. It is now being debated in the full Senate, where lawmakers have introduced hundreds of amendments.  Obama had already threatened to veto the House of Representatives‚Äô version of the annual bill, which passed that chamber last month. The White House opposed it for a number of reasons, including its use of $18 billion in special war funds for day-to-day military programs to avoid automatic budget cuts. The Senate version did not adopt that strategy. But Senator John McCain, the Armed Services Committee‚Äôs Republican chairman, filed an amendment with a similar plan to use $18 billion of so-called Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funds to pay for additional troops, more equipment and an increase in a planned military pay increase. McCain and other Republicans argued that the increased spending was necessary to keep Americans safe. In a statement, he criticized Obama‚Äôs veto threat as ‚Äúa sorry defense of the status quo,‚Äù and said he hoped Obama would change his mind. ‚ÄúI hope when the NDAA reaches the president‚Äôs desk, he understands the critical importance of this legislation to our national security better than his administration seems to now,‚Äù McCain said. Democrats said they would support more military spending if Republicans also approved spending on civilian programs. Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the Senate, said Democrats would offer their own amendment, adding funding for airport security, to combat Zika, for local police, to fight opioid addiction and improve infrastructure. ‚ÄúIf the Republicans pass the defense amendment but then block a similar increase to middle-class programs, they will have broken the budget agreement and the appropriations process will come to a grinding halt,‚Äù Reid told a news conference. After the House and Senate pass their versions of the NDAA, the two chambers agree on a final version of the bill. If that passes, it is sent for Obama to veto or sign into law. Obama vetoed the 2016 NDAA because it sought to increase defense spending by using the war funds, and over the restrictions involving the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for terrorism suspects. He eventually signed a version with the Guantanamo measures after the spending plan was removed. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 "
Clinton leads Trump by 10 points in White House matchup: poll,"(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump trails Democrat Hillary Clinton by 10 points in the 2016 presidential campaign, according to a poll released on Tuesday, showing little change from a week ago and suggesting his comments about a Mexican-American judge had yet to affect his standing in the race. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll came after several days in which Trump faced sharp criticism over his insistence that a federal judge who was born in Indiana to Mexican parents was biased in a case involving the celebrity billionaire. But the fallout from Trump‚Äôs comments appeared to have done little to help Clinton build her lead over the presumptive Republican nominee.   The online survey showed that 44.3 percent of likely voters said they would vote for Clinton, compared with 34.7 percent who would support Trump. A further 20.9 percent said they would not vote for either candidate. The results were little changed from last week‚Äôs survey. The poll was conducted from Friday to Tuesday, starting shortly after Trump‚Äôs first comments about U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against Trump University, the New York businessman‚Äôs defunct real estate school. Trump has suggested that Curiel‚Äôs heritage is influencing the judge‚Äôs opinion about the case because of Trump‚Äôs campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan called Trump‚Äôs comments textbook racism on Tuesday, while Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Trump should stop attacking minority groups. Bowing to pressure from fellow Republicans, Trump said on Tuesday he would no longer talk about the judge, adding that his previous remarks about Curiel had been misconstrued. Other events, including news that Clinton had secured enough  delegates and superdelegates to become the first female presidential candidate of a major U.S. political party, occurred toward the end of the poll. The poll included 1,261 respondents and had a credibility interval of 3.2 percentage points. See the poll results in Reuters' Polling Explorer. [polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/LIKELY:1/dates/20160401-20160607/type/day] For most of the year, Clinton has maintained an edge over Trump in the Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters. That edge briefly disappeared in May after Trump‚Äôs remaining rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out and party leaders started to line up behind his campaign.  Trump‚Äôs level of support has since eroded as he sparred with his party‚Äôs leadership and continued to be dogged with questions about Trump University. The Reuters/Ipsos poll differs from others that are often days removed from when their data was collected. As a result, the Reuters/Ipsos poll often detects shifts in opinion well ahead of other surveys.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Polling Explorer (Clinton versus Trump) polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/LIKELY:1/dates/20160401-20160607/type/day ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 "
Democrats seek probe of Trump donation to Florida attorney general,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Florida Democrats demanded investigations on Tuesday into a donation made by a Donald Trump foundation to the state‚Äôs attorney general, citing an Associated Press report that the Republican attorney general solicited the money around the time her office was considering a lawsuit against Trump University. At question is a 2013 donation of $25,000 from a Trump charity to a political committee supporting the attorney general, Pam Bondi, that has received media scrutiny this year.  ‚ÄúFlorida‚Äôs top law enforcement official solicited a donation from someone she was supposed to be investigating for fraud,‚Äù Florida Democratic Party Chair Allison Tant¬†said in a statement. ‚ÄúShe even went as far as to campaign for Trump, who has made a habit of bragging about buying politicians. Floridians deserve answers and Pam Bondi must be held accountable,‚Äù Tant added. Bondi, who has endorsed Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, on Tuesday called the AP report misleading. ‚ÄúMy office has made public every document on this issue, which shows no one in my office ever opened an investigation on Trump University nor was there a basis for doing so,‚Äù she said in a statement. ‚ÄúAny news story that suggests otherwise is completely false.‚Äù  The Trump campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The Associated Press reported on Monday that Bondi solicited the donation personally, around the time her office was debating whether to join a New York state investigation into Trump‚Äôs defunct real estate training school. Trump is fighting lawsuits that accuse his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaire‚Äôs real estate investment strategies. Bondi ended the lawsuit deliberations after the check arrived, the AP reported. At the time of the donation, she was seeking re-election. The Tampa Bay Times quoted a Bondi spokesman saying on Monday that documents released in the case ‚Äúconsistently demonstrate that through due diligence, staff assessed matters brought to their attention and properly determined that New York litigation seeks relief for any and all aggrieved consumers, regardless of their state of residence.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 "
Ruling against ex-AIG boss Greenberg raises stakes in Trump University case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A ruling by New York‚Äôs highest court in a fraud case against former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) Chief Executive Maurice ‚ÄúHank‚Äù Greenberg could affect the state‚Äôs case against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his defunct Trump University. The New York Court of Appeals ruled on Thursday that state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman could seek to recoup millions of dollars in bonus payments to Greenberg using the legal remedy called disgorgement. Unlike damages, which are used to compensate victims‚Äô losses, disgorgement requires a defendant to give back gains obtained from unlawful means. The ruling means that Schneiderman can go after $5 million he says Trump personally pocketed from the Trump University real-estate seminar venture. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt help him,‚Äù Jeffrey Goldman, Trump‚Äôs lawyer in the New York case, said on Monday of the Greenberg ruling. But Goldman said Trump expected to win the case and could also try to limit the amount subject to disgorgement, such as by arguing that most of it was earned outside of New York. According to the state‚Äôs 2013 lawsuit against Trump, filed in state court in Manhattan, Trump University was an unlicensed, illegal operation that bilked students of up to $35,000 each between 2005 and 2011. Two proposed class actions in California make similar allegations. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly raised the Trump University litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated. He has also accused the federal judge overseeing the California lawsuits of being biased against him because of his ethnicity. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. In the Greenberg case, the state accused the former CEO of orchestrating sham transactions at AIG and misleading shareholders about the company‚Äôs financial health between 2000 and 2005. Schneiderman is asking that Greenberg disgorge some $25 million in bonuses during that period, plus interest.  Greenberg has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, David Boies, who represented Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore in the dispute over the 2000 election recount, had argued that disgorgement was not a remedy available to the New York attorney general under either the state‚Äôs securities fraud law or another fraud statute. The Court of Appeals rejected Boies‚Äô arguments. The ability to seek disgorgement may be useful to Schneiderman because the California cases involving Trump University may be resolved before the New York case. One is scheduled for trial on Nov. 28, just a few weeks after the Nov. 8 election.  A settlement or judgment in those cases could undermine Schneiderman‚Äôs claim for $40 million in damages because he is suing on behalf of many of the same former Trump University students. But disgorgement claims would not be affected. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 "

"U.S. lawmakers want more Iran sanctions, but can't agree","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. senator said on Tuesday he would like to pass legislation to extend expiring sanctions on Iran and enable Congress to quickly enact new ones if necessary over the country‚Äôs ballistic missile tests. The Iran Sanctions Act, which imposed nuclear, missile and terrorism sanctions on Iran, expires at the end of 2016, and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress support extending it. But Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged that lawmakers have not yet unified behind a proposal that would attract enough votes to pass and become law. ‚ÄúMembers have different views,‚Äù he said at a roundtable discussion with reporters. The Obama administration has warned Congress that it would oppose new sanctions that interfere with the international nuclear pact, laying the groundwork for a potential fight over any legislation. Senator Bob Corker, the committee‚Äôs Republican chairman, has said he is working on legislation with Cardin that he hopes will attract strong bipartisan support. That measure has not yet been unveiled and aides said they had no more information about when it might be introduced. Cardin was one of several Democrats who joined every Republican in Congress in opposing the nuclear agreement with Iran announced last July. But he has urged lawmakers to accept it since a Republican-led effort to block the pact failed in September. After the deal went ahead, Cardin filed legislation meant to increase U.S. oversight of it. That bill never came up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. Cardin said he still felt that bill was valid and wants to amend it to extend the Iran Sanctions Act and create a ‚Äúlegislative framework‚Äù so sanctions could be imposed quickly if Iran pursues its ballistic missile program. Late last month, two Democratic senators who supported the Iran nuclear agreement, Tim Kaine and Chris Murphy, introduced a separate bill to extend the Iran Sanctions Act until Obama can guarantee Iran‚Äôs nuclear program is purely peaceful.  And Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte, with 18 other senators form her party, introduced a separate bill that would extend the Iran Sanctions Act through 2031 and require new sanctions over Iran‚Äôs ballistic missile efforts. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has said he wants any Iran bill to come to the floor with at least the 67 votes needed to override a presidential veto.

Republican's plan to revamp Dodd-Frank highlights U.S. political divide,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chair of the House Financial Services Committee has proposed getting rid of much of the regulation put in place after the financial crisis, unveiling a plan on Tuesday that ignited fierce debate in the presidential election but is expected to flame out in Washington. In a sweeping speech at the Economic Club of New York, Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, from Texas, laid out his ideas on weakening the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law just as polls opened in six states holding presidential primaries. Hensarling also met on Tuesday with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee who has called for dismantling the massive reform law. Trump‚Äôs campaign declined to comment on Hensarling‚Äôs plan. The lawmaker told Fox Business Network on Tuesday he would not describe the ‚Äúblow-by-blow‚Äù of his meeting with Trump but said they had common ground on Dodd-Frank.  Meanwhile, the Democrats‚Äô likely nominee, Hillary Clinton, sought to tie the real-estate tycoon to Hensarling‚Äôs proposal.  Clinton ‚Äústrongly opposes Chairman Hensarling and Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts to gut critical reforms put in place to protect the public after the financial crisis,‚Äù said her adviser Gary Gensler, who headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when Dodd-Frank was passed. ‚ÄúWhile Republicans attempt to roll back measures that protect consumers and curb excessive risk-taking on Wall Street, Hillary Clinton will fight to defend Dodd-Frank and go beyond it, with tough new rules, stronger enforcement and more accountability.‚Äù  Hensarling‚Äôs plan would allow banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or meeting much tougher capital requirements. It would also throw out the Volcker Rule that restricts banks from making speculative investments and eliminate the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council consisting of regulatory agencies‚Äô heads to designate firms as ‚Äúsystemically important,‚Äù also known as ‚Äútoo big to fail.‚Äù That label triggers requirements to hold more capital and abide by stricter regulations. In essence, Hensarling said his plan involved ‚Äúfar more loss-absorbing capital and far less federal control.‚Äù It would also maintain the law‚Äôs section on derivatives and keep the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by Dodd-Frank, albeit with a changed structure. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only replacing 89.7 percent of Dodd-Frank,‚Äù Hensarling joked. Few expect the plan, previewed in a video last week, to become law soon. While it could pass the Republican-controlled Congress, it would then have to be signed by President Barack Obama, who also signed Dodd-Frank into law.  On Tuesday White House spokesman Josh Earnest said reforms enacted after the crisis ‚Äúessentially guarantee that taxpayers will not be on the hook for bailing out big banks if their risky bets go south.‚Äù But Obama leaves office in January and those vying to replace him, including Senator Bernie Sanders running as a Democrat, have distinct views on regulation and Wall Street. ‚ÄúThose on the left who gave us Dodd-Frank believe in the principle that human nature is self-destructive and that people  - except themselves, of course - are fundamentally ignorant,‚Äù Hensarling said, demonstrating the political charge of his ideas.  Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick, shot back that Republicans seek ‚Äúto make life easier for mega bankers and tougher for ordinary Americans.‚Äù  Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is a firebrand for stronger regulation, said ‚Äúwhile most Republicans in Congress are debating not whether to run away from Trump - but how far and how fast - Congressman Hensarling is sprinting toward Trump Tower.‚Äù  Trump has given few clues to how he would take apart Dodd-Frank and what he might put in its place.  ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs something we both agree with, and that is Dodd-Frank is impeding economic growth,‚Äù Hensarling told Fox Business. ‚ÄúI think he well received the message. I think he was interested in the policy.‚Äù Clinton has proposed breaking up large banks that take excessive risk, charging institutions a ‚Äúrisk fee,‚Äù taxing high-frequency trading, and creating more oversight of ‚Äúshadow banking.‚Äù The most liberal candidate, Sanders has gone further and suggested reinstating the Glass-Steagall law that once separated commercial and investment banking. James Ballentine, head of congressional relations at  American Bankers Association, the industry‚Äôs lead trade group, said both parties ‚Äúagree that parts of Dodd-Frank just aren‚Äôt working.‚Äù ‚ÄúAny law that generates more than 24,000 pages of proposed and final rules will inevitably include problems that should be fixed,‚Äù he said in a statement.

District of Columbia approves $15/hour minimum wage,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The District of Columbia‚Äôs city council approved a $15-an-hour minimum wage on Tuesday, a rate adopted by a growing number of U.S. cities and states seeking to battle income inequality. The council voted unanimously to pass the measure boosting the minimum hourly wage to $15 by 2020, with subsequent hikes tied to inflation. A final vote will come later this month, and Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has backed the bill. Once approved, the U.S. capital will join California and New York in making $15 the hourly minimum. At least eight cities, including Seattle, have also approved the $15 base. ‚ÄúRaising the minimum wage will help address the issues of  residents being pushed out of the District due to rising costs of living and income inequality,‚Äù Council member Vincent Orange, a sponsor of the bill, said in the hearing. He and other supporters say Washington‚Äôs robust economy and growing population mean it can support a higher minimum wage.  The District of Columbia‚Äôs base wage is $10.50, and will go up by $1 on July 1 under existing law. The federal minimum is $7.25 an hour. The $15 minimum is estimated to raise wages for 114,000 workers, or about 14 percent of the District of Columbia‚Äôs workforce, according to an analysis for the council by the non-profit Economic Policy Institute. The higher pay proposal was supported by unions but was opposed by the District‚Äôs Chamber of Commerce. It said the District should not raise wages until neighboring suburbs do. The District of Columbia‚Äôs booming restaurant industry also opposed it. Restaurant owners and the local restaurant association said that higher costs would lead to layoffs. Some lawmakers said the measure did not go far enough to address a widening income gap and 18 percent poverty rate. Council member David Grosso added an amendment requiring the government to study a minimum income system to help the poorest residents. ‚ÄúRaising the minimum wage is a good thing, but is $15 enough? Or should the number be $35, or $50 an hour?‚Äù he asked. Under the measure, the minimum for workers who get tips, like waiters and bartenders, would also be $15 an hour by 2020. Following talks with unions, restaurateurs and community activists, employers would have to make up the difference between a base for tipped workers that will be $5 an hour in 2020, up from the current $2.77, Orange said.

Trump unyielding on Hispanic judge uproar,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday rejected a barrage of criticism from his own party over his allegations of bias against a Hispanic judge, insisting his concerns were valid. ‚ÄúAll I want to do is figure out why I‚Äôm being treated unfairly by a judge. And a lot of people agree with it,‚Äù Trump said on Fox News. Trump has been on the defensive since his comments last week about Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against Trump University, the New York businessman‚Äôs defunct real estate school. He has also been castigated by Democrats, including the party‚Äôs likely presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what else you could call these attacks other than racist, other than prejudiced, other than bigoted,‚Äù Clinton said in an interview with MSNBC on Monday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just plain wrong, and certainly wrong coming from someone who is vying to become President of the United States.‚Äù Trump told campaign supporters in a conference call they should stand by him in his attacks on the judge, Bloomberg Politics reported. It said during the call Trump distanced himself from a memo his campaign sent supporters on Sunday that urged them to avoid the issue. Asked for comment, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: ‚ÄúIt was a very positive call to discuss overall messaging.‚Äù Two Trump supporters, Tana Goertz and Scottie Nell Hughes, told CNN that former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer had said on the call that she wanted the campaign to go on the offense against expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Goertz said Trump told his suppporters not to be afraid to ‚Äúcall out the media‚Äù when TV reporters suggest that Trump is racist.  Trump has suggested that Curiel‚Äôs heritage is influencing the judge‚Äôs opinion about the case because of Trump‚Äôs campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, has pledged to seal the U.S.-Mexico border with a wall, and has said Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States. Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, joined the chorus of criticism. In an interview with Orlando‚Äôs WFTV, Rubio called Trump‚Äôs comments wrong and said he had to stop. ‚ÄúI ran for president and I warned this was going to happen,‚Äù Rubio said. Trump has regularly stirred up controversy on the campaign trail and has frequently dismayed Republican establishment leaders. His view of an ethnically biased judiciary has drawn a fresh wave of criticism, including concern in his own party. On Sunday he was asked if - by the same token - he believed a Muslim judge would be biased against him based on Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible. Yes,‚Äù Trump said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù Republican leaders including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have distanced themselves from Trump‚Äôs comments, saying they are worried the tone of his presidential campaign could enrage Latinos, who are a growing U.S. voting bloc. ‚ÄúIf this doesn‚Äôt change we‚Äôre in for big trouble,‚Äù Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, said on MSNBC on Monday. ‚ÄúI hope to be able to support the nominee. I certainly can‚Äôt now,‚Äù said Flake, whose state has a large percentage of Hispanics. A former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ohio Governor John Kasich, called on Trump to apologize to Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents.  ‚ÄúAttacking judges based on their race (and/or) religion is another tactic that divides our country,‚Äù Kasich wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúMore importantly, it is flat out wrong.‚Äù It was unclear what, if any, effect the latest furor would have on Trump‚Äôs unorthodox candidacy. States with significant Hispanic populations including California, New Mexico and New Jersey hold nominating contests on Tuesday. Trump fought back against his Republican critics on Monday, with especially sharp words for Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker. Gingrich, mentioned as a possible running mate to Trump, on Sunday called Trump‚Äôs comments inexcusable. ‚ÄúI was surprised at Newt,‚Äù Trump told the ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù program. ‚ÄúI thought it was inappropriate what he said.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 "

"From 'Hillarycare' debacle in 1990s, Clinton emerged more cautious","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich remembers the day 23 years ago when Hillary Clinton, notebook in hand, came to see him and other senior Republicans to talk about ‚ÄúHillarycare.‚Äù It was early 1993. Clinton, on behalf of her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, was leading a healthcare reform drive that vaulted her onto the national stage. Hillarycare would famously collapse after a fierce debate. In interviews with Reuters, some participants looked back on it as a crucible for the Democratic presidential front-runner that helped shape her approach to politics and governing. The experience, they said, may have tempered her ambitions for the capacity of government and made her more of an incrementalist.  ‚ÄúBack then, she seemed to have more of a taste for the big theory and the big plan,‚Äù said Republican activist and editor Bill Kristol, who wrote anti-Hillarycare strategy memos for Republicans in the 1990s. Kristol said that since then, Clinton, who is vying to face off against presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 U.S. election, seems to have learned that ‚Äúthe appearance of a massive government imposition on the citizenry doesn‚Äôt go over well in America.‚Äù Clinton walked into the 1993 meeting with Gingrich and said she wanted to learn from him and other leaders who were already studying healthcare. He was then the Republican whip in the U.S. House of Representatives. She was the highly accomplished wife of the Democratic Party‚Äôs new superstar and a Yale-educated lawyer.  Gingrich‚Äôs advice to her was simple: Do a series of small reforms year to year. Don‚Äôt do a comprehensive plan. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be able to pass it,‚Äù Gingrich said he warned Clinton in the meeting, also attended by then-House Republican Leader Bob Michel and then-Representative Dennis Hastert. ‚ÄúIt will fall of its own weight ... She listened to us carefully and promptly went off and did whatever she wanted to,‚Äù recalled Gingrich, now a political commentator often mentioned as a potential vice presidential running mate to Donald Trump. Later that year, the Clinton White House delivered an ambitious and complex, 1,342-page proposal for universal health insurance for all Americans. The first lady led the charge and testified in a series of lengthy congressional hearings. She wowed lawmakers with her energy and intelligence. But she could not convince enough of them to back the plan. Conservatives and healthcare industry interests attacked it. One negative TV ad campaign paid for by health insurers memorably featured the fictional couple Harry and Louise. In the end, Hillarycare failed, and never even received a floor vote in the House or Senate, although both chambers had Democratic majorities. Aided by the backlash that followed against ‚Äúbig government‚Äù Democrats, the Republicans in 1994 won a majority in the House for the first time since the 1950s, and Gingrich became speaker in early 1995.  Even Clinton supporters acknowledged that the size and scope of Hillarycare unsettled some Americans. ‚ÄúShe has learned that excessive disruption in this country creates great angst. And also division,‚Äù said Chris Jennings, who was the first lady‚Äôs congressional liaison during the 1993-94 battle, and is now an informal adviser on healthcare to Clinton‚Äôs campaign. Reuters did not speak with Clinton for this story. But Clinton wrote in her 2003 autobiography ‚ÄúLiving History‚Äù that ‚Äúour most critical mistake was trying to do too much, too fast. That said, I still believe we were right to try.‚Äù Clinton has also pointed out that while she was still first lady, she rebounded from the Hillarycare setback by urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a health insurance program for children in low-income families.  Clinton was elected in 2000 to the U.S. Senate, where she displayed bipartisanship and caution, said Jim Manley, who was a junior staffer for Senator Ted Kennedy in 1993-94 and later the spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. ‚ÄúOnce she got to the Senate, she was determined to work with Republicans,‚Äù Manley said. ‚ÄúThe senator I saw was someone who was very cautious. She picked an issue and worked very hard to build consensus.‚Äù Now, having run unsuccessfully for president in 2008 and having served as secretary of state, Clinton is on course to take on Trump, a former reality television personality and luxury real estate developer. On the campaign trail she talks about building on President Barack Obama‚Äôs 2010 Affordable Care Act, which made health insurance more accessible to millions of Americans. She favors a ‚Äúpublic option,‚Äù or government-run plan, being added to the Affordable Care Act. She also has suggested allowing some working Americans to buy into the Medicare government health insurance system for the elderly. ‚ÄúWhat she (Clinton) doesn‚Äôt believe at this moment in time is that we can or should just start all over again‚Äù on healthcare, said Jennings, her former congressional liaison.

Clinton clinches Democratic nomination: AP delegate count,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has reached the number of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, the Associated Press said on Monday, putting her on course to become the first woman to head a major U.S. party ticket. Clinton, a former secretary of state, reached the 2,383 delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic nominee  with a decisive weekend victory in Puerto Rico and a burst of last-minute support from superdelegates, the AP reported. Clinton has 1,812 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses. She also has the support of 571 superdelegates, according to an Associated Press count.

Trump University lawyers ask judge for another shot at ending class action,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump asked the California federal judge he attacked last week as biased based on his Mexican heritage to end the Trump University fraud class action currently scheduled to go on trial in November.  In filings late on Friday, Trump‚Äôs lawyers argued the case should not continue as a class action including all students who took the classes in California, New York and Florida. The lawyers claimed the students‚Äô cases were too dissimilar to be heard as a class because they were exposed to different marketing and advertisements and were told different things by Trump University employees. San Diego U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel is overseeing two class action lawsuits over Trump University. Last week, the presidential candidate said Curiel had treated him unfairly because he was a Mexican opposed to Trump‚Äôs proposal to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. Trump‚Äôs lawyers on Friday sought permission from Judge Curiel to renew an earlier motion to decertify the class. The judge previously ruled the case could proceed as a class action on the issue of liability, though each student would have to prove damages separately. In April, Trump‚Äôs lawyers also filed a motion to decertify the class in the other California case. The judge has not yet ruled on that motion. If the judge were to decertify the classes, former Trump University students would have to bring individual lawsuits.  Trump and his for-profit real estate seminars have been accused of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 for an opportunity to learn the businessman‚Äôs real estate investment strategies. The students claim they were defrauded, including by false claims that he had handpicked instructors to teach them his secrets.  ‚ÄúGiven TU students‚Äô radically different experiences, plaintiffs cannot show¬†that TU students were exposed to the same ‚Äòcore‚Äô misrepresentations,‚Äù Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Trump, wrote in Friday‚Äôs filing.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to comment on the filing. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 "
"Obama lauds Denver Broncos, Peyton Manning for Super Bowl win","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama welcomed the Denver Broncos to the White House on Monday to congratulate the Super Bowl champions for their victory over the Carolina Panthers and send off retiring quarterback Peyton Manning with words of praise.  ‚ÄúI have to say I‚Äôm so pleased to be able to host Peyton here at the White House before I left.¬†Anybody who has been a football fan has watched what is one of the greatest Hall of Fame careers ever,‚Äù Obama said, with the team standing behind him in the White House Rose Garden. ‚ÄúWe were all obviously a little disappointed to see him hang it up this spring.¬†But as somebody who is just a little bit older than he is, I was sympathetic to the idea that running around with these guys, it takes its toll,‚Äù Obama, 54, said of Manning, 40.

And this is a well-deserved celebration of an extraordinary season.‚Äù The Broncos won their third National Football League championship with a 24-10 win over Carolina in the Super Bowl in February.

U.S. appeals court weighs revealing 'Bridgegate' co-conspirators,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday heard nearly two hours of argument on whether to release publicly a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the ‚ÄúBridgegate‚Äù criminal case involving allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The three-judge panel at the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia did not immediately rule, and a rapid-fire volley of skeptical questions aimed at lawyers for both sides made it difficult to predict how the court was leaning. A lawyer representing an individual on the list, identified only as ‚ÄúJohn Doe,‚Äù urged the court to throw out a lower judge‚Äôs decision to release the information sought by a group of media companies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about what they would like to know,‚Äù said Doe‚Äôs attorney, Jenny Parker. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about what they are legally entitled to know.‚Äù But Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for the media, argued the public‚Äôs right to know was paramount. ‚ÄúThis is an extremely important issue that goes to how deeply this conspiracy went into the government,‚Äù he said. The list could shed light on the extent of the scheme to shut down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in 2013 in what prosecutors claim was an act of political revenge against a local mayor. Christie, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination this year, has denied any knowledge of the plot, but the scandal has remained a source of embarrassment. The list includes individuals that prosecutors believe were part of the conspiracy but are not facing criminal charges. Prosecutors have given defense lawyers the information as part of pretrial proceedings. Monday‚Äôs argument largely focused on a technical issue: whether the list was a ‚Äúbill of particulars,‚Äù a document that can be subject to public release, or an informal discovery letter that would normally stay sealed. Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, argued in support of Doe‚Äôs position, saying prosecutors should be allowed to hand over such information to defendants without fear it will be revealed. As an alternative, the court is considering whether to release all the names but that of John Doe, an option both Doe and the government oppose. Three people have been charged in the case. William Baroni, a former official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Kelly, Christie‚Äôs former deputy chief of staff, are scheduled to face trial in September. David Wildstein, also a former official at the Port Authority, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 "
Which ‚ÄòLa Raza‚Äô? Trump comments cause confusion over group's role,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs attacks on a federal judge of Mexican heritage have ignited hundreds of postings on social media about an advocacy group for Latinos that some Trump supporters are calling a terrorist organization. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has said that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, an Indiana native whose parents are Mexican immigrants, is making unfair rulings against him as the presiding judge in a class-action lawsuit over Trump University because of his plans to crack down on illegal immigration, including a promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. As evidence of what they say is Curiel‚Äôs bias, Trump and some of his supporters have pointed to the judge‚Äôs membership in La Raza Lawyers of San Diego, a local group for Hispanic lawyers that is affiliated with the Hispanic National Bar Association. Some Trump supporters have incorrectly linked La Raza Lawyers to the National Council of La Raza, a 50-year-old civil rights group that has been strongly critical of Trump‚Äôs proposals on immigration, as well as his idea to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.  The NCLR‚Äôs non-profit designation bars it from engaging in political campaigns, and the group‚Äôs website describes it as a ‚Äúnonpartisan voice for Latinos.‚Äù  A conservative blog, GotNews.com, first noted Curiel‚Äôs membership in the lawyer‚Äôs group, which it identified simply as ‚ÄúLa Raza,‚Äù on May 31. A day later, another conservative website, The Daily Caller, made a link to the NCLR. After the NCLR was first named, Trump fans on Twitter began attacking it. ‚ÄúJudge #TrumpHater #GonzaloCuriel is a member of the #TERRORIST group #LaRazza #BANLaRazza #GonzaloCuriel #RESIGN,‚Äù wrote a user @WillysBaldSpot, whose profile describes her as a Trump supporter.  ‚ÄúI would never have known the ‚ÄúLa Raza‚Äù organization existed without Trump‚Äôs controversial comments. #genius,‚Äù wrote @asamjulian, another self-proclaimed Trump fan. Trump on Sunday repeated his attack on Curiel in an interview on CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he‚Äôs got bias,‚Äù Trump said in the interview.  ‚ÄúThis judge has treated me very unfairly. He‚Äôs treated me in a hostile manner, and there‚Äôs something going on,‚Äù he added. The words ‚ÄúLa Raza‚Äù translate from Spanish to mean ‚Äúthe race,‚Äù which Trump fans cite as proof the NCLR is a group of people who hate anyone who isn‚Äôt Hispanic.  Lisa Navarrete, an NCLR spokeswoman, rejected that interpretation, saying that ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of groups had names that included ‚ÄúLa Raza‚Äù as a ‚Äúnod to our common heritage.‚Äù The attacks on the advocacy group are the latest signs of the increasing racial tension in the 2016 presidential race. Critics have said Trump‚Äôs calls to deport undocumented immigrants and ban Muslims amount to racism. His supporters say he‚Äôs defending the country from terrorism and violence.  Some supporters of the New York businessman have blamed the NCLR for the violent clashes between anti-Trump protesters and Trump fans at a San Jose, California, rally last week. ‚ÄúThank you La Raza for putting California into play for Trump,‚Äù wrote another supporter, @magnifier661. ‚ÄúYour violent fascism turned off the voting class #MAGA (a hashtag meaning Make America Great Again).‚Äù  The NCLR has been criticized in the past for its leaders‚Äô statements on immigration - the group supports a path to citizenship for people who entered the United States illegally - but Navarrete said it has never before attracted the ire of a presidential candidate.  Over the past week, she said, she and other NCLR officials have been calling journalists and pundits they believe are mischaracterizing the group.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing a lot of correcting the media and making sure they‚Äôre not repeating what supporters of Mr. Trump are saying,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sitting around arguing the minutiae of banking regulation, not running around in hoods.‚Äô‚Äù Hope Hicks, Trump‚Äôs spokeswoman, declined to comment.

California or bust? Clinton hopes to strike gold in pivotal vote,"WASHINGTON/LONG BEACH, California (Reuters) - If Hillary Clinton ends up losing California to Bernie Sanders, it will be because of voters like Nallely Perez. Perez personifies what a Clinton supporter was supposed to look like: a 24-year-old Latina who grew up idolizing the former first lady as a groundbreaking woman in politics. But when she votes in California‚Äôs Democratic presidential nominating contest on Tuesday, Perez will be supporting Sanders.   ‚ÄúEverything that I would stand for, he has said it,‚Äù said Perez, a student at California State University, Long Beach, who said she likes Sanders‚Äô promises of tuition-free college and universal healthcare. ‚ÄúWe found our voice in him.‚Äù  California is the final big contest in the long, bitter fight for the Democratic nomination. Opinion polls show the Democratic race there tightening in recent weeks. Where Clinton, a former secretary of state, once held a big lead over Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, the two now are nearly tied.  A University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times poll released on Friday showed Sanders with a one-percentage-point lead over Clinton in the state, 44 to 43 percent, a swing from March when Clinton held a nine-point edge.  On the Republican side, Donald Trump has earned the nomination for the Nov. 8 election, and Clinton is close to capturing the number of delegates she needs to head the Democratic ticket. Her campaign expects that a win in New Jersey earlier on Tuesday will secure the nomination.  But a loss in a populous Democratic stronghold like California could lend credence to Trump‚Äôs claim that she is a weakened candidate.  ‚ÄúClinton would like to go to the nominating convention with the wind at her back and tamp down the perception that she doesn‚Äôt excite Democrats,‚Äù said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist in Washington. A Sanders victory will not clear the way to his nomination unless it triggers a defection by scores of superdelegates - party office-holders and officials - from Clinton‚Äôs camp, an unlikely outcome.  Sanders has vowed to use California as a springboard to the party convention in Philadelphia in July. A win, especially a big one, would validate the self-described democratic socialist‚Äôs decision to stay in the race to the end and give him leverage to influence Clinton‚Äôs policies and cabinet picks. ‚ÄúThe game he is playing is to be able to draw as many concessions as he can out of the party and the Clinton campaign,‚Äù Mollineau said. The area around Long Beach, part of the 47th congressional district in California, has emerged as a key battleground. Sanders campaigned there a week ago; Clinton was in the area on Friday and may return again before Tuesday‚Äôs vote. The district‚Äôs congressman, Representative Alan Lowenthal, remains one of the few uncommitted Democratic members of the House of Representatives to either Clinton or Sanders. His district once leaned Republican, but is becoming increasingly liberal thanks to an influx of Latino and Asian-American voters who comprise the majority of  residents.  The large minority population might be expected to translate into an advantage for Clinton, who has consistently shown strength with such groups. But a Reuters reporter who toured the area observed an abundance of Sanders supporters.  In the Belmont Shore neighborhood of Long Beach, Sanders  volunteers Gordon Winiemko and Jon Fellman manned a table on the sidewalk outside a coffeehouse.  They had a long discussion with Shawn Coleman, a 24-year-old film student, who told them he preferred Sanders to Clinton because ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm a little bit more for what Bernie has in mind for the future, I think he‚Äôs right, and Hillary doesn‚Äôt really seem on it.‚Äù¬† Lia Roldan, a 42-year-old set decorator in the film industry who lives in Long Beach, said she was voting for Sanders because ‚Äúhe has a lot of experience in standing up for causes that benefit the working class.‚Äù Roldan said she would reluctantly support Clinton in a contest against Trump. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll vote for her only because I don‚Äôt want a Republican to win, but I don‚Äôt really feel in my heart that I would vote for her otherwise,‚Äù she said.  Stopping Trump was on the minds of those who said they would vote for Clinton on Tuesday. ‚ÄúI love Bernie,‚Äù said Sami Reed, 42, the CEO of a corporate wellness business, interviewed in a thrift shop, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôll probably vote for Hillary just because I don‚Äôt want Trump to win.‚Äù  A second-term congressman, Lowenthal told Reuters he has come under a ‚Äútremendous amount of grief and pressure from Sanders people‚Äù to support him, but he would not say for whom he would vote. At California events, Clinton has been careful to focus her criticism on Trump, not Sanders, while talking up her national security experience. She will almost certainly need the support of passionate Sanders‚Äô backers to defeat the outspoken Trump in November. ",politicsNews,"June 5, 2016 "
New York City ad campaign supports transgender bathroom rights,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday announced a citywide advertising campaign supporting a person‚Äôs right to use bathrooms corresponding with his or her gender identity, wading into a debate that has pitted more than a dozen states against the federal government. The advertisements, which de Blasio described as the nation‚Äôs first government-sponsored citywide campaign of its kind, will appear in subway cars, at bus stops, on phone booths and in both online and traditional publications. The ads feature transgender New Yorkers and encourage residents to ‚Äúlook past pink and blue,‚Äù among other messages. In March, de Blasio signed an executive order ensuring that transgender people can use the bathroom of their choice in any city-owned building without being asked for identification by employees. City law already allows transgender individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. ‚ÄúWhile other cities and states are legislating intolerance and taking away individuals‚Äô right to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity, we are proudly standing with our transgender and gender non-conforming New Yorkers,‚Äù de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement. President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration in May released guidance telling public schools across the United States that they must allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. The letter, which offered the U.S. government‚Äôs interpretation of anti-discrimination law, contained the implicit threat of cutting off federal funding for schools that do not comply.  Officials from more than a dozen states have either sued or plan to sue the Obama administration, challenging the directive as unconstitutional. North Carolina and the U.S. Department of Justice exchanged federal lawsuits last month over the state‚Äôs law banning people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to their gender of their birth.

Clinton hires Latino as voter outreach deputy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As she looks ahead to the November White House election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has hired the leader of a group that seeks to built political power among Latinos to help mobilize key voting communities. Cristobal¬†Alex, president of the non-partisan Latino Victory Project, will be the Clinton campaign‚Äôs new deputy director of voter outreach and mobilization, starting later this month, an aide said. Alex will work under Addisu Demissie, the national voter outreach and mobilization director.  Minority voters have been major blocs for Clinton as she has built a commanding lead over Senator Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic nomination, and they could prove a crucial factor in the general election.  Among those minority voters are Latinos, a fast-growing group that, many activists say, has recently seen a spike in voter registration. Many activists point to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump as the spur for those registrations. Seeking to portray himself as tough on illegal immigration, Trump has angered Latinos by saying Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers over the border, and pledging to build a border wall that he says he will make Mexico pay for. Most recently, he has drawn criticism, including from senior Republicans, for saying a Mexican-American federal judge overseeing lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University cannot do his job properly because of his Mexican heritage. In contrast, both Clinton and Sanders have actively wooed Latino voters, releasing ads in Spanish and promising to hire Latinos to key cabinet positions.  But one complication when courting these voters is the difficulty in polling multi-lingual, multi-cultural communities. ‚ÄúThroughout the election cycle we know that we are going to see a lot of really bad Latino polling,‚Äù said Matt Barreto, co-founder of research firm Latino Decisions and pollster for the Clinton campaign for Latino issues. Barreto said that he has used ‚Äúlarge sample surveys of Latino voters‚Äù for the campaign. ‚ÄúWe are very confident that the Clinton campaign is taking all the necessary steps to gather the most accurate data possible on Latinos voters,‚Äù he added. Clinton added to her delegate lead Sunday, when she won Puerto Rico‚Äôs primary. Primaries on Tuesday, when Clinton hopes to wrap up the nomination, include delegate-rich California, with a diverse population including Latinos, African Americans and Asian Americans. Latino activists have warned Democrats that merely attacking  Trump is not enough to win their votes, pressing for engagement on a range of issues. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 "

Clinton picks up win in Puerto Rico's Democratic primary: NBC News,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton won the Puerto Rico Democratic primary on Sunday, moving her a step closer to prevailing over her rival, Bernie Sanders, in the fight for her party‚Äôs presidential nomination.  Clinton was the projected winner over Sanders in the U.S. island territory, according to NBC News. The win gives the former secretary of state a boost ahead of a big night on Tuesday, when six states, including New Jersey and California, will hold nominating contests. Clinton is hoping to cross the threshold of 2,382 delegates needed to secure the nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election as early as 8 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, when polls close in New Jersey. She and Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, are in a dead heat in California. But delegates in the state are awarded on a proportional basis, so even a loss there for Clinton would not be likely to stop her from securing her party‚Äôs nomination and a likely general election contest with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Ahead of Puerto Rico‚Äôs nominating contest, Clinton had been just 60 delegates shy of clinching the nomination, when including superdelegates, who consist of party leaders and elected senators, members of Congress and governors. Sanders is bracing for a prolonged fight that will run into the Democratic convention at the end of July. Networks reported huge voter turnout and long lines in Puerto Rico, with just over 430 polling stations open compared with over 2,000 in 2008.  The island is suffering through a severe debt crisis, which has hampered basic government services. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 "
"On shrinking U.S. corporate tax base, presidential candidates differ sharply","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The corporate income tax is a major revenue source for the U.S. government, but it has been shrinking for decades and the three main presidential candidates could not differ more dramatically on what to do about it. Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have starkly contrasting plans, some more detailed than others, for taxing corporations. The tax paid by companies on their profits accounted for 30 percent of the U.S. federal tax base in the 1950s; last year, it was only 11 percent, Internal Revenue Service data show.  The decline, experts say, has many causes: loopholes that cut corporations‚Äô taxes; a lower corporate tax rate; rising overseas profits that are lightly taxed; and a shift away from incorporation toward partnerships and other business structures that pay no corporate tax. Despite the dwindling corporate tax base, Trump, the Republicans‚Äô presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election, wants to ease the burden on companies by slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. In this regard, he shares the same view as most Republicans. Trump, a real estate developer, has described his proposals as revenue neutral, saying reduced tax rates would be paid for by eliminating some tax breaks and repatriating corporate cash held overseas. However, the Tax Policy Center, a centrist tax research group in Washington, said that under Trump‚Äôs plan, corporate income tax revenues would fall $1.9 trillion from 2016 to 2026. A cut on that scale would hugely expand the federal budget deficit, unless severe budget cuts or alternative tax hikes were also made, the center said. Steven Rosenthal, a Tax Policy Center senior fellow, said Trump‚Äôs plan is a standard business-focused approach, but ‚Äúthe drafting is incomplete, so we can‚Äôt tell exactly what he‚Äôs thinking.‚Äù   A Trump campaign spokeswoman pointed to the proposals on the campaign website but declined to comment further. Republicans generally support corporate income tax cuts because, they say that would help corporations compete globally. In addition, some question the validity of the tax, which they say is passed on to consumers and investors. ‚ÄúTaxing businesses is the Democrats‚Äô version of manna from heaven: someone else supposedly is paying for the government. But all citizens are hurt through lower growth, higher prices, lower wages,‚Äù said Grover Norquist, a Republican tax activist. ‚ÄúTaxes should be transparent. It should be clear who is paying them. The corporate income tax is designed to hide the tax burden,‚Äù said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a small-government group that opposes tax increases. Democrats tend to view the corporate income tax as a fair levy on businesses that benefit from the security, services and infrastructure provided by government. Corporations have been taxed by Washington since 1909. Clinton, a former secretary of state and the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has not promised a corporate tax cut. Like Trump, she has called for closing loopholes that corporations use to avoid taxes. But unlike Trump, her plan would raise corporate tax revenues by $136 billion over 10 years, the Tax Policy Center said. Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said the candidate‚Äôs proposals ‚Äúgo further to prevent the erosion of the corporate tax base by ensuring corporations pay their fair share.‚Äù But the Clinton campaign has yet to release its full plan. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, would make more drastic changes and boost the corporate tax take by $1 trillion in the same decade, mostly by raising taxes on overseas profits, according to the Tax Policy Center. ‚ÄúVirtually all of the revenue raised by Senator Sanders‚Äô corporate tax plan would come from large, multinational corporations that have shifted their profits offshore to avoid taxes,‚Äù said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels.  The question of whether businesses pay their fair share of taxes strikes a chord with Americans on the campaign trail. An April Gallup poll found 67 percent of U.S. adults said corporations do not pay enough tax.    Since the mid-1950s, income tax receipts from individuals  have held steady at 40-50 percent of federal revenues, while payroll taxes, deducted from the paychecks of wage-earners, have soared to 34 percent last year from 5-10 percent in the 1950s. Meanwhile, Congress has steadily reduced the corporate tax rate, now 35 percent. That is down from 46 percent in 1986, and 52 percent in 1956. Over that period, corporations have also carved out various loopholes that let them avoid paying the full rate.  The corporate tax applies only to incorporated businesses, while other business structures have been gaining in popularity. In 2003, the share of U.S. business income generated by incorporated companies fell below the share made by partnerships and other kinds of companies that pay no corporate tax.  Whatever candidates may say on the campaign trail, no changes can occur without agreement by Congress. And despite years of talk about the importance of tax reform, neither President Barack Obama nor lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been able to agree on a reform agenda that many say is needed to boost the economy and bring sanity to a tax code of Byzantine complexity.

Senior Republicans criticize Trump's remarks on Hispanic judge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior U.S. Republicans distanced themselves on Sunday from Donald Trump‚Äôs comments about a Mexican-American judge, saying they were worried that the tone of his presidential campaign could enrage Latinos, who are a growing U.S. voting bloc. Trump has accused U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of harboring a bias against him in lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University, the New York business man‚Äôs now-defunct real estate school. The presumptive Republican nominee has suggested Curiel‚Äôs Mexican-American heritage had influenced the judge‚Äôs opinion because of Trump‚Äôs campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt disagree more‚Äù with Trump‚Äôs comments about the judge. ‚ÄúI am concerned about the Hispanic vote, America is changing,‚Äù McConnell told ‚ÄúMeet The Press‚Äù. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a big mistake for our party to write off Latino Americans. I am concerned about that and I hope he will change his direction on that.‚Äù Democrats have accused Trump of racially tinged rhetoric about Latinos, including his description of Mexican immigrants as ‚Äúcriminals and rapists‚Äù in the speech he gave a year ago launching his campaign. Such rhetoric has exacerbated friction between Trump and Republican party leaders such as McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. For the past few years, the party has been trying to broaden its appeal with Latino voters and senior Republicans are concerned that Trump‚Äôs comments could cost the party votes, not only in the presidential race but in congressional races as well. Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been mentioned as a possible running mate to Trump, called Trump‚Äôs comments about the judge ‚Äúinexcusable.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made,‚Äù Gingrich told Fox News. Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican-immigrant parents. ‚ÄúHe is a member of a club or society very strongly pro Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he‚Äôs got bias. I want to build a wall,‚Äù Trump said in an interview on Sunday on ‚ÄúFace the Nation‚Äù.

Yes.‚Äù McConnell said America is a nation full of immigrants ‚Äî pointing out that his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, came to the United States when she was eight and didn‚Äôt speak English. ‚ÄúAll of us came here from somewhere else,‚Äù McConnell said.

Legal scholars on the right and the left have criticized Trump for attacking the judge, saying it could harm judicial independence should he become president.  Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is of Mexican descent, was one of the few Republicans to defend Trump. Gonzales argued in a column in The Washington Post that Trump should be allowed to question a judge‚Äôs fairness, saying that questioning a judge is crucial to ensuring public trust in the courts.  But when asked about the racial element in an interview on Sunday on Fox News, Gonzales criticized Trump.  ‚ÄúI certainly would have taken a different approach,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhenever you say something about a judge‚Äôs nationality, I think it demeans the office and hurts the judiciary as a whole.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 5, 2016 "
"Farah breaks Moorcroft's 3,000m British record","(Reuters) - Double Olympic champion Mo Farah continued his build-up to the Rio Games by breaking David Moorcroft‚Äôs 34-year-old British record in the 3,000 meters at a Diamond League meeting in Birmingham on Sunday. Farah, the 5,000 and 10,000m gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, won in seven minutes 32.62 seconds after striding out at the front in a determined effort to beat Moorcroft‚Äôs 1982 time of 7:32.79. ‚ÄúDid I get it?,‚Äù the 33-year-old, who pulled out of the meet last year after being angered by allegations surrounding his coach Alberto Salazar, who denied violating anti-doping rules, asked a BBC interviewer. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs incredible... I thought I‚Äôd just missed it. It was a bit tight on the last lap, I had to dig in,‚Äù added Farah, who paid tribute to his boyhood hero Muhammad Ali before the race by striking a boxing stance. Former Olympic and world heavyweight champion Ali died on Friday aged 74 and Sunday‚Äôs meeting held a minute‚Äôs applause for the man known as ‚ÄòThe Greatest‚Äô. ‚ÄúHe was a big hero of mine and I send all my condolences to his family and friends,‚Äù said Somali-born Farah, who will defend  his titles in Rio in August. Kenya‚Äôs Mathew Kiptanui was second in 7:44.16 with compatriot Hillary Maiyo third. Kenyan David Rudisha, the Olympic 800m champion and world record holder, ran the second fastest 600m ever with his time of 1:13.10, not far off the world best of 1:12.81 in the little-run distance. He felt he could have gone faster. ‚ÄúI think I lost it in the last 100 meters,‚Äù he said. Apart from Farah and Rudisha, there were four other world leading times at the meet including for Conseslus Kipruto of Kenya in winning the men‚Äôs steeplechase in 8:00.12 and for his  compatriot Asbel Kiprop who took the 1,500 in 3:29.33. Qatar‚Äôs Mutaz Barshim won the men‚Äôs high jump with a world leading leap of 2.37 meters, while Cuba‚Äôs Yarisley Silva produced a year‚Äôs best of 4.84 in the women‚Äôs pole vault.    Britain‚Äôs Greg Rutherford, another 2012 Olympic champion, was beaten in the long jump for the first time since last July. He said after his jump of 8.17 left him fifth, with American Marquise Goodwin winning comfortably with a mark of 8.42, that he was struggling with a ‚Äúmild neck injury‚Äù from the previous round in Rome last week. ‚ÄúWe have tried to get it 100 percent ready in time. Sadly I have made it worse on the first landing and I am currently unable to move my neck,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe doctor thinks it is a bad whiplash but it won‚Äôt affect my Olympic bid. I am positive the British Athletics medical staff will be able to fix it over the next week.‚Äù Australia‚Äôs Sally Pearson, the Olympic 100 meters hurdles champion, made her competitive return a year after shattering her wrist in a fall in Rome but finished seventh in a race won by American Kendra Harrison in 12.46 seconds.

Kerry hails Mongolia as 'oasis of democracy' in tough neighborhood,"ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hailed Mongolia as an ‚Äúoasis of democracy‚Äù sitting in a tough location between Russia and China as he made a rare visit by a cabinet-level U.S. official on Sunday. Arriving from Paris, Kerry made the visit to Mongolia en route to Beijing to attend the eighth Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the high-level talks held between the United States and China each year. The Obama administration has sought to cultivate Mongolia as a partner, given its location between two increasingly assertive U.S. rivals ‚Äì China and Russia, countries Mongolia relies on heavily for trade and energy imports. U.S. officials regularly tout Mongolia, a country of three million people, as an inspirational story of democratic transition since winning independence from the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago. ‚ÄúYou really set a great example,‚Äù Kerry told Mongolian and American embassy staff at the U.S. ambassador‚Äôs residence. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got China on one side of you, and Russia on the other side of you, and there are always a lot of pressures, and here you are in this oasis of democracy fighting for your own identity.‚Äù But Mongolia‚Äôs democratic and human rights records have come under scrutiny. The 2015 State Department report on human rights in Mongolia noted ‚Äúvague laws and a lack of transparency in legislative, executive, and judicial processes‚Äù that ‚Äúundermined government efficiency and public confidence and invited corruption.‚Äù Parliamentary elections are to be held this month, and democracy advocates have criticized a rule change by parliament last month that is expected to disadvantage smaller parties. The lack of transparency in business regulations has hampered foreign investment, officials say, badly needed in an economy where growth has all but halted, far from a peak of 17.5 percent in 2011.  Falling prices for its chief exports, coal and copper, and weak demand from China, by far Mongolia‚Äôs biggest trading partner, are behind the slowdown. Kerry said it was important the Mongolian government implement a transparency agreement with the United States, which would provide greater business confidence to foreign investors.  The Mongolian and U.S. governments signed the agreement in 2013 after years of negotiations but its final implementation has been mired in red tape.  The agreement would commit Mongolia to publish in English an explanation for proposed regulations, and allow for public comments on those regulations, among other measures. ‚ÄúThe implementation of this agreement is really key, a very important step to be able to attract foreign direct investment,‚Äù Kerry said.

Clinton hits rivals on immigration in California campaign swing,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton fought on two fronts in California on Saturday as she sought to wrap up her battle with Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination, taking aim at him and at Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, with attacks on their immigration stances. Both Clinton and Sanders campaigned across California, stopping in immigrant communities, big cities and the agricultural heartland on the final weekend before Tuesday‚Äôs primary in the nation‚Äôs biggest state. Clinton used a stop at a Los Angeles-area college to criticize Trump for making ‚Äúhateful, very prejudicial‚Äù statements about immigrants and Sanders for voting against a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill. ‚ÄúI was in the Senate then, so was President Obama and so was Senator Sanders. President Obama and I voted for it, Senator Sanders voted against it. And that ended it,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúIt was heartbreaking,‚Äù she added. Latinos comprise almost 40 percent of California‚Äôs population of roughly 39 million. Clinton, also a former secretary of state, is expected to sew up the party nomination on Tuesday, when California is one of six state holding nominating contests. Except for Washington, D.C., those states are holding the last Democratic nominating contests before the party‚Äôs July convention. Clinton needs a win in heavily Democratic California to begin unifying her party. Though Sanders, a U.S. senator of Vermont, faces nearly insurmountable odds to become the Democratic nominee, he has invested heavily in California, where a win could pressure the party to adopt some of the populist policies that have driven his campaign. Polls show Sanders has chipped away at Clinton‚Äôs lead in the state, where Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have built a vast network of supporters, including increasingly powerful Hispanic voters. Recent tracking polls showed Clinton having a 2 to 10 percentage point lead over Sanders in California. At a town hall in Los Angeles, Sanders promised to fight for comprehensive immigration reform and said that trade deals, over which he and Clinton have frequently sparred, funnel ‚Äúcheap corn‚Äù into Mexico and ‚Äúdrive small family farmers off their land.‚Äù California is home to one-fourth of the immigrant population in the United States, at around 10 million people, and also home to one-fourth of the 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the country. Clinton, with 2,312 delegates, needs 71 more to reach the required 2,383 for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has 1,545. California, the most populous U.S. state, has 548 delegates who are awarded proportionately to the popular vote. The other states holding nominating contests on June 7 are Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. Clinton also slammed Trump on immigration at a rally in Oxnard, a city of about 200,000 located northwest of Los Angeles that is almost 75 percent Hispanic. Trump on Friday escalated his attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a lawsuit involving fraud at a failed Trump business, Trump University. Trump suggested that Curiel‚Äôs Mexican-American heritage was influencing his opinion on the lawsuit. Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants. ‚ÄúThis is not just another outlandish insulting comment from Donald Trump and it is not normal politics, this is something much, much more dangerous,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúJudge Curiel is just as much of an American as I am and just as much of an American as Donald Trump is,‚Äù Clinton said. The New York billionaire businessman has vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. ",politicsNews,"June 4, 2016 "
Clinton opens up double-digit lead over Trump nationwide: Reuters/Ipsos poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton has opened up a double-digit lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, regaining ground after the New York billionaire briefly tied her last month, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.  The shift in support comes as Clinton steps up her attacks on the real estate mogul‚Äôs policy positions, and as Trump fends off criticisms of his eponymous university and the pace at which he doled out money that he raised for U.S. veterans.  Some 46 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton, while 35 percent said they supported Trump, and another 19 percent said they would not support either, according to the survey of 1,421 people conducted between May 30 and June 3.  Trump had briefly tied Clinton in support among likely U.S. voters in mid-May, raising expectations for a tight race between the two likely contenders in November's presidential election.  Trump has all but sealed the Republican nod after a string of big wins in state nominating contests forced his party rivals to drop out, while Clinton is still fending off a long-shot bid for the Democratic spot on the ballot by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  Clinton is hoping to seal the nomination next week, when a slew of big states including New Jersey and California will hold primaries, allowing her to consolidate her party‚Äôs support ahead of a general election matchup against Trump.  Clinton‚Äôs polling surge comes as Trump is been harangued by criticisms over his Trump University, the target of a trio of lawsuits that claim it misled thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about Trump‚Äôs investment strategies. Trump has defended the school and said he will relaunch it once the litigation ends.  Trump this week also outlined the recipients of millions of dollars in donations he raised at an event in January for veterans‚Äô groups, in a bid to end speculation that he had not yet handed over all of the money.  On Thursday, Clinton used a foreign policy speech in California to paint Trump‚Äôs policy platform as ‚Äúdangerously incoherent‚Äù and cast her Republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure.  Trump responded by saying she lied about his positions and by ripping her record as secretary of state, which he says was marred her handling of government emails and the death of a U.S. ambassador in Libya.

U.S. flexes muscles as Asia worries about South China Sea row,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The United States stepped up pressure on China on Saturday to rein in its actions in the South China Sea, with top defense officials underlining Washington‚Äôs military superiority and vowing to remain the main guarantor of Asian security for decades to come. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the U.S. approach to the Asia-Pacific remained ‚Äúone of commitment, strength and inclusion‚Äù, but he also warned China against provocative behavior in the South China Sea. Any action by China to reclaim land in the Scarborough Shoal, an outcrop in the disputed sea, would have consequences, Carter said. ‚ÄúI hope that this development doesn‚Äôt occur, because it will result in actions being taken by the both United States and ... by others in the region which would have the effect of not only increasing tensions but isolating China,‚Äù Carter told the Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional security forum in Singapore. ‚ÄúThe United States will remain the most powerful military and main underwriter of security in the region for decades to come ‚Äì and there should be no doubt about that.‚Äù The South China Sea has become a flashpoint between the United States, which increased its focus on the Asia-Pacific under President Barack Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúpivot‚Äù, and China, which is projecting ever greater economic, political and military power in the region. Carter however said he would welcome China‚Äôs participation in a ‚Äúprincipled security network‚Äù for Asia. ‚ÄúForward thinking statesmen and leaders must ... come together to ensure a positive principled future,‚Äù he said, adding that the network he envisaged could also help protect against ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs worrying actions‚Äù and the growing strategic impact of climate change. The deputy head of China‚Äôs delegation to the forum said the United States should reduce its provocative exercises and patrols in the region and said any attempts to isolate China would fail. ‚ÄúThis is a time of cooperation and common security,‚Äù Rear Admiral Guan Youfei told reporters. ‚ÄúThe U.S. action to take sides is not agreed by many countries. We hope the U.S. will also listen to the other countries.‚Äù Other Asian leaders said the situation in the South China Sea was viewed with concern across the region. ‚ÄúAll countries in the region need to recognize that our shared prosperities and the enviable rate of growth that this region enjoys over past decades will be put at risk by aggressive behavior or actions by any one of us,‚Äù Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar told the forum.  Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said his country would help Southeast Asian nations build their security capabilities to deal with what he called unilateral, dangerous and coercive actions in the South China Sea. ‚ÄúIn the South China Sea, we have been witnessing large-scale and rapid land reclamation, building of outposts and utilization of them for military purposes,‚Äù Nakatani said. ‚ÄúNo country can be an outsider of this issue.‚Äù A Chinese official responded by saying Japan should be careful ‚Äúnot to interfere and stir up problems‚Äù in the waterway, while China‚Äôs foreign ministry also weighed in regarding the U.S. and Japanese comments. ‚ÄúCounties outside the region should stick to their promises and not make thoughtless remarks about issues of territorial sovereignty,‚Äù the ministry said in a statement. Trillions of dollars of trade a year passes through the South China Sea, which is home to rich oil, gas and fishing resources. Besides China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have claims in the area, and rising tensions have been fuelling increasing security spending in the region. ‚ÄúThe uncertainty of China‚Äôs future trajectory is arguably the main driving concern about possible military competition now and in the future,‚Äù Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said. Carter said that for decades some critics had been predicting an impending U.S. withdrawal from the region, but this would not happen. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because this region, which is home to nearly half the world‚Äôs population and nearly half the global economy,  remains the most consequential for America‚Äôs own security and prosperity.‚Äù In an apparent counter to ‚ÄúAmerica-first‚Äù policies expounded by prospective Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, including suggestions that U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Asia, Carter stressed bipartisan support for continued engagement. The Shangri-La Dialogue is being held ahead of a significant ruling expected in coming weeks on a case filed by the Philippines in the International Court of Arbitration challenging China‚Äôs South China Sea claims, which Beijing has vowed to ignore. The United States has been lobbying Asian and other countries to back the judges‚Äô statement that their ruling must be binding, a call echoed by Japan on Saturday. China has lobbied on the other side for support for its position that the court lacks jurisdiction in the case. ",politicsNews,"June 4, 2016 "
Vietnamese general says first purchase of U.S. weapons some way off,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The recent lifting of the U.S. arms embargo against Vietnam boosted trust between the former enemies, but significant weapons purchases are some way off, a senior Vietnamese military official said on Saturday. Deputy Defence Minister Nguyen Chi Vinh told Reuters possible weapons buys were part of a long-planned strengthening of Vietnamese-U.S. relations across economic, political, cultural and security fronts. ‚ÄúWe are not sure what we can buy from the U.S. or what we want to buy,‚Äù Vinh said in some of the first public comments from a Vietnamese defense official since U.S. President Barack Obama lifted the embargo in Hanoi last month. ‚ÄúIt is at a very, very first step, I should stress,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe removal of the embargo is not just significant in terms of trade, but also in terms of improving high-level trust and confidence.‚Äù An evolving military relationship between the United States and Vietnam is being closely watched across the region as Hanoi seeks to deter its giant neighbor China over its more asserted stance on claims in the disputed South China Sea. The United States is eyeing closer military relations with Hanoi as it seeks to expand its so-called strategic pivot back to Asia amid concern over China‚Äôs rising power in the region. Vietnam has rapidly increased military spending over the last decade, relying on its Cold War-era patron Moscow for purchases of state-of-the-art submarines, jet fighters and advanced missile systems.   U.S. weapons manufacturers are eager to tap a new market in Vietnam but regional security experts believe Hanoi will move only gradually in easing its dependence on Moscow.  The relatively high cost of U.S. weapons is another factor but regional military sources believe Vietnam is keen to first acquire improved surveillance and communications equipment to help it keep a better watch on China. This could include maritime patrol aircraft. Speaking privately, U.S. officials say Vietnam has yet to start detailed discussions with Washington about its specific needs and gaps in its capabilities, a factor which they believe reflects decades of habitual secrecy. Speaking on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore, Vinh did not detail Vietnam‚Äôs first planned U.S. procurements but repeatedly stated Vietnam‚Äôs military improvements were defensive. Vietnam, like China and Taiwan, claims all the Paracel and Spratlys archipelagos in the South China Sea and Hanoi officials say privately that rising tensions in the South China Sea have complicated otherwise solid relations with Beijing.

"Japan, South Korea to set up direct line between defense ministers","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said on Saturday that Japan and South Korea agreed to expand an emergency communication system between their defense ministries, including adding a new direct line between defense ministers. Tensions have been high in the region since early January when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test. It has followed that with a satellite launch and tests of various missiles, most recently a failed launch on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWhat it means is that we will make use of phones for emergency communication, when security-related emergencies such as a missile launch occur, and communication and coordination between the defense authorities of the two countries are needed,‚Äù Nakatani told reporters at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional security forum in Singapore. He said such emergency phone lines would be expanded to include a new direct link between the two countries‚Äô defense ministers.  Nakatani said talks would continue on sharing and safeguarding sensitive information on Pyongyang‚Äôs missile and nuclear programs.  Under the framework, South Korea would pass relevant information to the United States, with which Seoul already has a legally-binding pact to share and safeguard intelligence called General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). The United States would then pass the information on to Japan. It would work similarly the other way around since the United States has also signed a GSOMIA with Japan.  Some South Koreans have voiced concerns about signing a security pact with Japan, their one-time colonial ruler.  Besides historical issues stemming from Japan‚Äôs annexation of the Korean peninsula that ended in 1945, ties have been chilled by a long-running territorial dispute over a group of tiny islets.

Treasury's Lew: China pause on reforms would have 'very bad consequences',"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Friday China would see ‚Äúvery bad consequences‚Äù for its economy and bilateral U.S. relations if it backs away from its stated goals to open its markets and rebalance its economy toward consumer-led growth. Lew, in an interview with Reuters in Seoul, said he would ‚Äúkeep the pressure‚Äù on Chinese officials during talks in Beijing next week to stick to their reform commitments and execute pledges to reduce excess industrial capacity that is distorting world markets. China faces diminished economic prospects in the medium and long term if it fails to continue its reforms, Lew said. ‚ÄúFrankly, if China takes a time-out or a step back on the reform agenda, that will have very bad consequences for China‚Äôs economy and it will flow over and not be good in terms of our bilateral economic relations,‚Äù Lew said. The U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue meetings on June 6-7 in Beijing come at a time of increasing trade tensions between the world‚Äôs two largest economies. The U.S. Commerce Department has recently imposed steep anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on a wide-range of Chinese steel products, while U.S. business groups have complained about new Chinese regulations they say favor local firms. Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan is plumbing five-year lows against the dollar, raising concerns about the potential for another devaluation as the Federal Reserve prepares to resume interest rate increases after pausing for the past few months. Lew said China had largely been keeping its G20 commitments to avoid competitive currency devaluations, adding that its action in recent months to spend reserves to support the yuan, also known as the renminbi or RMB, have been consistent with those commitments.   ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs intervention in the last year has not been to devalue but it‚Äôs been largely to support the RMB,‚Äù Lew said. ‚ÄúI think the test of whether China‚Äôs moved decisively in an orderly way to a more market-oriented exchange rate is whether they‚Äôre willing to tolerate movement in both directions.‚Äù Likewise, Lew said South Korea also needed to resist temptations to intervene in currency markets when there is upward pressure on the won. He said Seoul had refrained from active interventions for the past six to nine months. ‚ÄúWe have made it clear that we‚Äôve recognized that. But we‚Äôve also said that that has to be a durable policy. It has to be a policy that can withstand pressure when markets are going in both directions,‚Äù he said. He said South Korea‚Äôs interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade bloc, assuming the deal is ratified,  would provide an incentive to improve its exchange rate policy. A currency side-agreement to the TPP would require transparency in interventions and commitments to avoid interventions to gain trade advantages. The U.S.-China economic and foreign policy talks in Beijing will also provide a forum to air U.S. business groups‚Äô concerns about regulations in China that they say favor domestic firms. For example, foreign insurers have raised concerns about new cyber security regulations that require ‚Äúsecure and controllable‚Äù information technology. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs an anti-monopoly law, or a national security law, if it‚Äôs being either designed or implemented in a way that‚Äôs designed to create undue burdens on foreign competition, that‚Äôs problematic,‚Äù Lew said. Lew said it was important for the next U.S. president to continue the Strategic and Economic Dialogue because otherwise such disputes may not be discussed on a bilateral basis. At a separate meeting on Friday with South Korean Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho, Lew said that coordinated global action was needed to increase pressure on North Korea to drop its pursuit of nuclear weapons. A senior Treasury official said that this would require additional actions by China to adhere to new sanctions aimed at cutting off North Korea from the international financial system until it changes its behavior.

"Trump campaigns in California, denounces protesters at rally as 'thugs'","REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday denounced protesters in California as ‚Äúthugs‚Äù a day after another demonstration outside one of his political rallies turned violent ahead of the state‚Äôs presidential primary. Demonstrators traded blows on Thursday evening in the street outside the San Jose Convention Center, videos posted to Twitter and online by media showed. Hundreds of protesters waved Mexican flags, chanted anti-Trump slogans and burned Trump hats and at least one U.S. flag. Speaking before a packed crowd in the northern California city of Redding on Friday, Trump described the previous night‚Äôs rally as ‚Äúa love fest inside. No problems whatsoever.‚Äù But then his supporters ‚Äúwalked out and they got accosted by a bunch of thugs,‚Äù he said. The protesters, many angry over Trump‚Äôs rhetoric against illegal immigration, have gathered at Trump rallies for months. Trump, now the Republican Party‚Äôs likely presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, canceled a rally in Chicago in March after clashes broke out between his supporters and protesters. The San Jose Police Department reported 300 to 400 protesters had gathered outside the Trump rally on Thursday, where police formed lines to protect attendants exiting the convention center. A number of the skirmishes occurred beyond police lines on nearby streets and at a parking garage, a Reuters photographer said. One sergeant suffered minor injuries after a protester struck him with a metal object. Police reported four arrests. Over 250 officers staffed the ‚Äúall-hands on deck event,‚Äù said San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia. ‚ÄúIn hindsight, we‚Äôd say that wasn‚Äôt enough,‚Äù said Garcia. For future events of that scope, ‚Äúwe would need more officers with an absolute, number one goal of keeping both parties separate as much as we can.‚Äù San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, a Democrat, told the Associated Press that Trump needs to take responsibility for his supporters‚Äô conduct at the rallies. But Trump, speaking in Redding on Friday, made light of the mayor‚Äôs concerns. ‚ÄúYou know what I say when we have a protestor, which isn‚Äôt very often, I say, ‚ÄòBe very gentle, please don‚Äôt hurt him ... If he punches you in the face, smile,‚Äô‚Äù Trump said. Violence has peppered Trump‚Äôs recent rallies in New Mexico and California, the U.S. state with the largest immigrant population, in advance of primary elections there on Tuesday. The latest violence followed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton‚Äôs scorching critique of Trump in a speech on Thursday in which she derided the real estate developer as a dangerous man with an angry, fearful world view. Clinton told CNN on Friday that Trump had set a ‚Äúlow bar‚Äù regarding violence at political events. ‚ÄúNow is it a surprise that people who don‚Äôt like him are stepping over that bar? I don‚Äôt think it is,‚Äù Clinton said. But Friday afternoon‚Äôs rally was peaceful as supporters from Redding and neighboring towns gathered as early as 8 a.m. local time (1500 GMT) to catch a glimpse of the candidate, many wearing hats emblazoned with Trump‚Äôs signature slogan: ‚ÄúMake America Great Again.‚Äù Despite the unrest in San Jose, attendees said they felt at ease at Friday‚Äôs event. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both retired law enforcement,‚Äù Heather Jimenez, a 45-year-old Cottonwood resident, said of herself and her husband. ‚ÄúNo worries.‚Äù Although no formal protests broke out in Redding, the event attracted some who disapprove of Trump, but wanted to witness his high-flying campaign style in person. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been hearing his nonsense,‚Äù said Rachel Ochoa, a 57-year-old Redding resident who teaches English as a second language. ‚ÄúAll we hear is him attacking the opponents and others.‚Äù Trump has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists across the U.S. border and has promised to build a wall between the two neighboring countries and make Mexico pay for it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna build that wall, folks,‚Äù Trump said on Friday as the crowd chanted its support. Trump also lamented the loss of American jobs to other countries, a key theme in his campaign. The message resonated in Redding, which residents say has been hit hard by the economic downturn. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a lot of people here out of work,‚Äù said Joyce Tausch, a 78-year-old retiree who lives in Redding. ‚ÄúTrump is gonna do things for us.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 "

Trump seizes on U.S. jobs report to target Democratic economic policies,"WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said a U.S. jobs report on Friday that showed the weakest hiring in more than five years proved that Democratic economic policies are pushing the country in the wrong direction. The report gave Trump his biggest opening yet to target Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on the economy, after months of mostly solid economic indicators. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going the wrong way folks. They‚Äôve been kidding themselves, they‚Äôre playing games. It‚Äôs going the wrong way,‚Äù Trump told a rally in Redding, California. Clinton, the front-runner to be the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has credited President Barack Obama for reviving the U.S. economy after the 2008 recession but has also said that the recovery is not over. In a CNN interview, Clinton acknowledged the figures were ‚Äúdisappointing to anybody.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think President Obama inherited a terrible situation and I‚Äôve said that repeatedly over the past year and we‚Äôve come a long way out of the ditch we were dropped into by failed Republican policies,‚Äù Clinton told CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper. The unemployment rate in May fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent, the lowest level since November 2007, but that was in part due to people dropping out of the labor force. Overall, nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs in May.  If disappointing jobs reports continue, Trump could use Clinton‚Äôs pledge to build on Obama‚Äôs work against her to woo working-class voters in states such as Ohio. The state has lost well-paying manufacturing jobs and is also a key presidential battleground - closely competitive because it does not lean heavily Republican or Democratic. Clinton, a former secretary of state, is likely to finally clinch the Democratic nomination over challenger Bernie Sanders on Tuesday when six states hold nominating contests. One is California, the most populous U.S. state, with the most Democratic delegates of any other state and where both candidates have been campaigning heavily. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, some 46 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton, while 35 percent said they supported Trump, and another 19 percent said they would not support either. The survey of 1,421 people was conducted between May 30 and June 3. Trump, a real estate developer, has already sewn up the Republican nomination. In the general election campaign, job creation plans are expected to be a priority, particularly in states that have been hit hard by manufacturing-sector job losses.  Trump has promised to toss out international trade deals to revive U.S. manufacturing and sweep away a slew of environmental regulations to bolster the ailing energy sector.  Job creation in the manufacturing and construction sectors fell sharply in May, according to Friday‚Äôs jobs report.  Trump has already begun working economic numbers into his stump speeches. He has said he could put 15 states that have voted for Democratic presidents in recent elections in play, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, which have all lost manufacturing-sector jobs. Peter Morici, a conservative economist and professor in the business school at the University of Maryland, said the poor jobs numbers reflected trends that have driven voter frustration and fueled the populist campaigns of both Trump and Sanders.  He said Trump needed to add detail to his economic policies, such as detailing changes to social programs like Medicaid, which provides healthcare for the poor. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just turn around and cut income taxes without doing something about those things,‚Äù Morici said. Republican strategists agreed that Friday‚Äôs jobs report created an opportunity for Trump to differentiate his policies from Obama‚Äôs or Clinton‚Äôs. ‚ÄúIt allows Donald Trump to tout how he would do things differently as president and focus on some of the job-creation plans that he has,‚Äù Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said, adding it would also allow Trump to talk about his record as a businessman.     Trump has been fleshing out his foreign policy ideas and has released a tax plan, but he has been light on other details, such as how he would oversee the U.S. financial system.

Trump defends attacks on Mexican-American U.S. federal judge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump defended his attacks on a Mexican-American judge on Friday, resisting pressure from top Republicans to moderate his tone out of concern he is hurting his chances to win the White House. Trump‚Äôs bomb-throwing rhetoric helped him defeat 16 Republican rivals for the party‚Äôs nomination for the Nov. 8 election. But facing a tough fight with expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, many Republicans want him to present a more disciplined image. Feeling confident his method has been a winner, Trump so far has waved off some of the advice from Republicans who support him but want less loose talk. In a CNN interview, Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the son of Mexican immigrants who is the presiding judge in lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University, the New York businessman‚Äôs defunct real estate training school. Trump suggested Curiel‚Äôs Mexican heritage was influencing the judge‚Äôs opinion about the case because Trump has campaigned on a platform of building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to stop illegal immigration. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs proud of his heritage,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a Mexican. We‚Äôre building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can‚Äôt even believe. This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment,‚Äù Trump said.  The judge a week ago unsealed documents related to the case. Comments from the two top elected U.S. Republicans, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, reflected continued worries among establishment Republicans about Trump. Ryan, who endorsed Trump on Thursday, said the comments from Trump about the judge were ‚Äúout of left field.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe clearly says and does things I don‚Äôt agree with. And I‚Äôve had to speak up ... (from) time to time when that has occurred. And I‚Äôll continue to do that if that‚Äôs necessary. I hope it‚Äôs not,‚Äù Ryan told a Milwaukee radio station. McConnell, speaking on MSNBC, raised concerns about Trump‚Äôs criticism of New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, a rising star in the Republican Party who can appeal to Hispanic voters. After attacking her record last week, Trump on Thursday moderated his tone and said he would like her endorsement. ‚ÄúWe ought to be trying to unify, he ought to be trying to unify the party behind him,‚Äù McConnell said of Trump. ‚ÄúMost of us are committed to supporting him and trying to bring the party together, and I think he needs to play his role on all of that as well.‚Äù  Trump received 32 percent support from Latino voters in an NBC News/Survey Monkey poll this week, a respectable number given his critical comments throughout the campaign about illegal immigrants, most of whom come from Mexico and other Latin American countries. But the specter of Trump as the nominee has worried some Hispanic Republicans. This week, Ruth Guerra, who is a Mexican-American, resigned as the Republican National Committee‚Äôs chief of Hispanic media relations. A source familiar with her departure said she was not comfortable with Trump as the nominee. More broadly, Reince Preibus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been trying to persuade Trump to moderate his tone as a way to heal fissures in the party, at a time when Trump will need to rely on deep-pocketed Republican loyalists to finance a $1 billion campaign. ‚ÄúHe needs one thing and one thing only: discipline,‚Äù said a senior party official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But if a Trump rally in Redding, California, was any indication, the candidate feels his method is working. ‚ÄúTemperament is a very important word,‚Äù Trump said, referring to Clinton‚Äôs charge that he is temperamentally unfit for the White House. ‚ÄúWe need toughness in tone. We need toughness in temperament.‚Äù Stung by attacks on him from Clinton on Thursday, Trump dredged up scandals from the 1990s to hit her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, saying they are dishonest. He cited Bill Clinton‚Äôs affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. ‚ÄúFirst of all, she‚Äôs always got problems: Whitewater (a controversial real estate deal), impeachment, lies. He ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt have sex with that woman,‚Äô‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúThese are lying people. We don‚Äôt need, folks, another four years of the Clintons.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 "
Obama commutes prison terms of 42 non-violent drug offenders,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama commuted the prison terms of 42 non-violent drug offenders, nearly half of whom were serving life sentences, in his latest batch of clemency decisions, the White House said on Friday. The individuals ‚Äúhave more than repaid their debt to society and earned this second chance,‚Äù Neil Eggleston, the White House counsel, wrote in a blog. They were convicted under drug sentencing laws put on the books before Obama became president that were ‚Äúoutdated and unduly harsh,‚Äù Eggleston wrote.  Obama has worked to reform the U.S. criminal justice system to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for drug crimes. It is one of the few areas in which the Democratic president has received support from Republican lawmakers.  Many of the convicts had been serving time for crack cocaine charges. Crack offenders have for years faced stiffer penalties than offenders of powder cocaine, even though the two substances are molecularly similar. Critics have said the disparity has unfairly hurt minority communities.  Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years in April, 2014. The program has struggled under a deluge of thousands of unprocessed cases.  Some legal experts, including Rachel Barkow, faculty director at the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University, have urged Obama to move faster on the program, saying unless he does, the program will remain a ‚Äúlottery‚Äù for thousands of other convicts. Friday‚Äôs commutations bring the total to 348, more than granted by the previous seven presidents combined, the White House said. George W. Bush commuted the sentences of 11 individuals, Bill Clinton granted clemency to 61 and George H.W. Bush granted clemency to three people, the White House said.  ‚ÄúWe are confident that there will be many more commutations in the months‚Äù before Obama leaves office in January next year,  Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general, said in a release. The White House also said Obama is committed to strengthening drug rehabilitation programs. ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 "
Kerry: video cut 'clumsy and stupid and inappropriate',"PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It was stupid, clumsy and inappropriate for someone to edit the video of a State Department briefing in 2013, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday as two U.S. lawmakers demanded information about the incident.  A Republican congressman asked the State Department inspector general to investigate why part of a public briefing that dealt with Iran nuclear talks was cut before it was posted online while another demanded documents about the incident. The excised portion of the Dec. 2, 2013, briefing included a question about whether an earlier spokeswoman for the department had misled reporters about whether the United States was holding secret direct nuclear talks with Iran. The spokeswoman had denied there were such talks, which were later made public. The State Department this week said she did not know about the secret talks when she denied their existence. Speaking to reporters in Paris, Kerry sounded chagrined about the episode, which has drawn Republican criticism. ‚ÄúWhatever happened was both clumsy and stupid and inappropriate,‚Äù Kerry said. Asked if he wanted people who tampered with the historical record working for him, he replied: ‚ÄúOf course not. I just said, it‚Äôs inappropriate.‚Äù The State Department initially said it believed a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù caused the gap but on Wednesday said an internal inquiry found it was a deliberate omission. However, it said no rules were broken because none existed governing the integrity of the briefing video. Rules are now being put in place. U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the technician who excised part of the video told investigators she got a call asking her to do so, discussed the request with her supervisor and concluded it came from a ‚Äúlevel of credibility and authority‚Äù high enough that they should act on the request. The State Department has said the technician does not remember who called her. On Friday the department said it cannot use internal phone records to trace who requested the cut to the briefing video because it keeps such data for only 24 hours. Top officials in the Bureau of Public Affairs in late 2013, including former Assistant Secretary Doug Frantz, former spokeswoman Jen Psaki, former deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, and deputy assistant secretaries Dana Smith, Valerie Fowler and Moira Whelan have all denied asking for the video to be excised. ‚ÄúIn tampering with this video, the Bureau of Public Affairs has undermined its mission to ‚Äòcommunicate timely and accurate information with the goal of furthering U.S. foreign policy‚Äô,‚Äù House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said in a letter released by his office that asked the department‚Äôs inspector general, Steve Linick, to investigate the matter. Separately, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, also a Republican, on Tuesday wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry asking for documents related to the edited video to be turned over to his panel by Wednesday.

"U.S. lawmakers probe Fed cyber breaches, cite 'serious concerns'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee has launched an investigation into the Federal Reserve‚Äôs cyber security practices after a Reuters report revealed more than 50 cyber breaches at the U.S. central bank between 2011 and 2015. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology on Friday sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to express ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù over the central bank‚Äôs ability to protect sensitive financial information. The letter cited the Reuters report, which was based on heavily redacted internal Fed records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. The redacted records did not say who hacked the bank‚Äôs systems or whether they accessed sensitive information or stole money. ‚ÄúThese reports raise serious concerns about the Federal Reserve‚Äôs cyber security posture, including its ability to prevent threats from compromising highly sensitive financial information housed on the agency‚Äôs systems,‚Äù said the letter, signed by House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, and Barry Loudermilk, a Georgia Republican and chairman of the panel‚Äôs oversight subcommittee. A Fed spokesperson said the central bank had received the panel‚Äôs letter and ‚Äúwill respond to it.‚Äù The panel asked the Fed‚Äôs national cyber security team - the National Incident Response Team - to turn over all cyber incident reports in unredacted form from Jan. 1, 2009, to the present. It also asked for incident reports from the Fed‚Äôs local incident response teams. Global policymakers, regulators and financial institutions have become increasingly concerned about the security of the international banking system after a string of cyber attacks against banks in Bangladesh, Vietnam and elsewhere linked to fraudulent transaction messages sent across the global financial platform SWIFT. The probe into the Fed‚Äôs security practices followed a separate inquiry by the same committee into the Federal Reserve Bank of New York‚Äôs handling of the cyber theft of $81 million from one of its accounts held by the central bank of Bangladesh. The committee said it has jurisdiction over the Fed‚Äôs cyber security because the panel is tasked with oversight of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency responsible for developing federal cyber security standards and guidelines, under a 2014 federal information technology law. The panel also requested a ‚Äúdetailed description of all confirmed cyber security incidents‚Äù from 2009 to the present, all documents and communications referring or relating to ‚Äúhigher impact cases‚Äù handled by the Fed‚Äôs NIRT team, all documents and communications with the Fed‚Äôs Office of Inspector General related to confirmed cyber incidents, and an organizational chart detailing the Fed‚Äôs top cyber security personnel. The committee requested a response to its inquiry by June 17. (Click here to read the letter: tmsnrt.rs/1VBXvSz) The Fed‚Äôs computer systems hold confidential information on discussions about monetary policy that drives financial markets. The central bank‚Äôs staff suspected hackers or spies were behind many of the breaches, the records obtained by Reuters show.  The Fed had declined to comment on the records, which represent only a slice of all cyber attacks on the central bank because they include only cases involving the Washington-based Board of Governors, a federal agency that is subject to public records laws.

Clinton attacks Trump's foreign policy as a threat to U.S. safety,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lambasted  Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy platform as ‚Äúdangerously incoherent‚Äù in a speech on Thursday that cast her Republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure. In remarks that at times resembled a comedy roast, Clinton unleashed a torrent of polished zingers and one-liners to attack Trump‚Äôs policies and character, suggesting Trump might start a nuclear war if elected to the White House simply because ‚Äúsomebody got under his very thin skin.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs ideas are not just different, they are dangerously incoherent,‚Äù she said to a room of supporters in San Diego, California. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.‚Äù Clinton, the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee, delivered her speech as she seeks to shift her attention to the Nov. 8 election against likely rival Trump and away from Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, who is continuing his long-shot bid for the nomination. Clinton was speaking in San Diego ahead of California‚Äôs June 7 primary election. Democratic Party leaders have fretted about how to best oppose Trump, who managed to knock out all 16 rivals for the Republican nomination in part with his uninhibited style of assailing them with personal insults. Trump revels in referring to Clinton as ‚ÄúCrooked Hillary‚Äù and dredging up the infidelities of her husband, Bill Clinton, the former president. Clinton‚Äôs remarks were intended in part to show she would not be cowed and that she could go toe-to-toe with him in scornful put-downs. ‚ÄúHe says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,‚Äù she said as the crowd guffawed, and she suggested Trump would run the U.S. economy ‚Äúlike one of his casinos.‚Äù During her speech, Clinton predicted Trump, who has been deeply critical of Clinton‚Äôs foreign policy record, would take to his Twitter account to insult her, and he did. ‚ÄúBad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton!‚Äù ran one posting during the speech, which included a typo. ‚ÄúReading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn‚Äôt even look presidential!‚Äù Trump has said previously that Clinton is distorting his actual policies. Amid the laugh lines, Clinton cited her own experience as secretary of state, in particular her role advising President Barack Obama during the mission to kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, to suggest her approach to foreign policy was the more serious. ‚ÄúHe praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends, including the British prime minister, the mayor of London, the German chancellor, the president of Mexico and the pope,‚Äù Clinton said, listing some of the allies with whom Trump has verbally sparred in the last year. Obama, who has also been repeatedly mocked by Trump, has criticized Trump as being ignorant or cavalier about world affairs and has said that Trump‚Äôs rise has ‚Äúrattled‚Äù foreign leaders. Trump has talked tough on foreign policy. He has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by Obama. Trump has also vowed to renegotiate trade deals, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, and said he would ask members of the 28-nation NATO alliance to ‚Äúpay up‚Äù or ‚Äúget out.‚Äù He has said he would sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang‚Äôs nuclear program. Clinton derided these and other positions, promising she would do a better job keeping the United States safe. Standing in front of a backdrop of 19 large U.S. flags, an unusual abundance even by the standards of presidential campaign events, Clinton painted the election as a choice between ‚Äútwo very different visions.‚Äù ‚ÄúOne that‚Äôs angry, afraid and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline,‚Äù she said, summing up Trumpism. ‚ÄúThe other is hopeful, generous and confident in the knowledge that America is great, just like we always have been.‚Äù Trump has criticized Clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her 2009-2013 stint as secretary of state, including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. He cites Clinton‚Äôs support for the war in Iraq, launched by former Republican President George W. Bush, as another example of her shortcomings. Democratic challenger Sanders echoed Clinton‚Äôs concerns about Trump after her speech, though he also criticized Clinton‚Äôs foreign policy. ‚ÄúI agree ... that Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy ideas are incredibly reckless and irresponsible,‚Äù Sanders said in a statement. In criticizing Clinton, Sanders cited her vote for the war in Iraq, calling it ‚Äúthe worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history,‚Äù and said ‚Äúshe has been a proponent of regime change, as in Libya, without thinking through the consequences.‚Äù In assailing each other‚Äôs suitability for the White House, Clinton and Trump are reflecting a negative voter mood ahead of next month‚Äôs party conventions that will choose the presidential nominees. Both Clinton and Trump are facing record-low favorability ratings. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Friday through Tuesday shows half of Trump supporters say the primary reason they are going to vote for him is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want Hillary Clinton to win,‚Äù while 41 percent of Clinton supporters cite their primary reason as not wanting Trump to win.

NATO's top soldier says Trump comments play into hands of Putin,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - NATO‚Äôs top military officer, General Petr Pavel, denounced U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday for criticizing the alliance as obsolete and said such comments played to the hands of its opponents. In unusual criticism of a presidential candidate, Pavel, chairman of the NATO Military Committee, said in an interview that Russian ‚ÄúPresident (Vladimir) Putin and some others may be pleased by this approach‚Äù. ‚ÄúTo take such an approach would be a great mistake,‚Äù he said. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, has criticized the decades-old NATO alliance with mainly European nations - a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy - as obsolete and too costly for the United States. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was set up in a different era, Trump has said, when the main threat to the West was the Soviet Union. It was ill-suited to fighting terrorism. Pavel, a former Czech Republic army chief, said the NATO alliance formed in 1949 was not perfect but it had great potential as well as the chance to be improved. ‚ÄúStatements like these are not necessarily damaging, but they are not useful,‚Äù Pavel said in Singapore on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia‚Äôs biggest security summit. On Thursday, Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton also lambasted Trump‚Äôs foreign policy platform as ‚Äúdangerously incoherent‚Äù. Trump‚Äôs emergence as a strong presidential candidate has been a talking point at the Shangri-La Dialogue. Carl Thayer, an Australian security expert, said the prospect of Trump in office would have to be dealt with realistically. Australia‚Äôs experience had shown that ‚Äúyou damn well have to work with the U.S. president‚Äù, he told a news conference. At the meeting, Pavel was to discuss regional issues, including rival claims in the South China Sea and rising tension in Northeast Asia, where North Korea has been stepping up its testing of nuclear capabilities. China and the United States have traded accusations of militarizing the South China Sea, which is claimed almost entirely by Beijing. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have claims to parts of the waters, through which trade worth trillions of dollars is shipped every year. ‚ÄúFreedom of navigation in this region, through the South China Sea, is crucial for any further development in the region and it‚Äôs difficult to imagine that without this freedom, there will be stability and peace in this region,‚Äù Pavel said. NATO could not act on the issue using military means, but mainly political means, he added. North Korea, which conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and followed that with a satellite launch and tests of various missiles, was a great concern for NATO, Pavel said. Western sanctions have not been successful in deterring Pyongyang from developing its nuclear capabilities. ‚ÄúThe only country which may change the equation is China,‚Äù Pavel said, pointing to the fact that 90 percent of North Korea‚Äôs trade is with its big neighbor. Pavel also said he hoped an upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw would agree cyber as an operational domain of war, along with air, sea, land and space. ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 "

Trump escalates attacks on judge in Trump University suit: WSJ,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his attacks on the federal judge presiding over lawsuits against Trump University, saying the judge had ‚Äúan absolute conflict‚Äù because of his Mexican heritage, the Wall Street Journal reported. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, is fighting lawsuits that accuse his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaire‚Äôs real estate investment strategies. In an interview with the newspaper, Trump said U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had ‚Äúan absolute conflict‚Äù in presiding over the litigation given that he was ‚Äúof Mexican heritage‚Äù and a member of a Latino lawyers‚Äô association. Trump said the background of the judge, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants, was relevant because of his campaign stance against illegal immigration and his pledge to seal the southern U.S. border, the Journal said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm building a wall. It‚Äôs an inherent conflict of interest,‚Äù Trump said, according to the newspaper. The New York businessman also alleged the judge was a former colleague and friend of one of the Trump University plaintiffs‚Äô lawyers, the newspaper said. The judge and the lawyer once worked together as federal prosecutors, but the lawyer, Jason Forge, in an interview with the Journal, said he had never seen the judge socially. ‚ÄúNeither Judge Curiel‚Äôs ethnicity nor the fact that we crossed paths as prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office well over a decade ago is to blame‚Äù for Trump‚Äôs actions, Forge told the Journal. An assistant in Curiel‚Äôs chambers said he was not commenting on the matter, the newspaper said. At a rally in San Diego last week, Trump lashed out at Curiel.  ‚ÄúI have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He‚Äôs a hater,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama,‚Äù Trump said, adding he believed Curiel was Mexican. Legal scholars said Trump could face consequences for slamming the judge, although many have speculated that Curiel was unlikely to sanction him formally. Trump has drawn criticism for his comments about immigrants from Mexico, some of whom he has said were criminals and rapists. He has proposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration and requiring Mexico to pay for it. ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 "
U.S. election's anti-trade tone 'concerning': Union Pacific CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rhetoric against free trade from both likely U.S. presidential nominees poses a risk to the economy and consumers who would lose out if international trade is restrained, the chief executive of the largest U.S. railroad said on Thursday. ‚ÄúGlobal trade is not getting a fair shake in the dialogue,‚Äù Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) CEO Lance Fritz said during a discussion with Reuters journalists. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve devolved to a form of populism in the rhetoric and that strikes me as having a lot of negative consequences.‚Äù Free trade agreements and their impact on U.S. workers have been a major theme in the 2016 campaign for the presidential election on Nov. 8. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and promised to rip up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has criticized the partnership deal, which was signed in February but has not yet won congressional approval.  Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific has a growing business serving cross-border trade with Mexico, and over the past decade has reported increased shipments of containers full of consumer goods, many of which come from Asia. Fritz said both candidates are arguing that NAFTA is ‚Äúa bad thing,‚Äù even though Trump has been more vocal than Clinton in warning about losing jobs to foreign competition and threatening to slap tariffs on imported goods. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs concerning to me,‚Äù Fritz said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs telling the U.S. public that free trade is a bad idea, and that‚Äôs patently not in the interest of the U.S. consumer.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are worried and thinking about what-ifs,‚Äù Fritz said when asked how his company would deal with a Trump or Clinton administration. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm hoping is we get a little more clarity as we get closer (to the election) and it starts making sense and we can plan around it.‚Äù Fritz, who has served as Union Pacific CEO since February 2015, also noted that despite low fuel prices, U.S. consumers still have not taken up the slack in the broader economy. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen a strong consumer in a little while,‚Äù he said. Fritz said he did not know when the railroad would meet its target of an operating ratio, a measure of efficiency, of 55 percent. The ratio expresses operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, so the lower the figure the better.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get there as soon as we can in a reasonable fashion,‚Äù he said. Union Pacific posted a first-quarter operating ratio of 65.1 percent. U.S. railroads generally have a significantly higher operating ratio than the 58.9 percent reported in the first quarter by Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) and Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO). Fritz also said Union Pacific would have an anti-collision system mandated by Congress in place by the deadline of 2018. But the company would need the two one-year extensions allowed to ‚Äúdebug‚Äù the Positive Train Control (PTC) system, he added. Last year, Congress extended the deadline for the system‚Äôs implementation beyond 2015, despite opposition from some lawmakers following a fatal Amtrak crash in Pennsylvania in May 2015.

"Lawsuit filed over Baltimore primary election, citing irregularities","(Reuters) - Activists have filed a federal lawsuit asking for a new primary election in Baltimore, alleging irregularities during the tight April 26 mayoral vote. The lawsuit was filed by Voters Organized for the Integrity of City Elections, or VOICE, late on Wednesday against the city and state election boards. It asks the U.S. District Court to declare the primary election results invalid, order a new election and appoint federal observers to oversee the procedure. State Senator Catherine Pugh narrowly won the Democratic mayoral primary, defeating former Mayor Sheila Dixon. Pugh had backed law enforcement reform as Baltimore recovers from unrest in April 2015 sparked by a black man‚Äôs death from an injury suffered while in police custody. An investigation by the state election board found that Pugh won the nomination by 2,400 votes. About 1,700 ballots cast in the primary were handled improperly, the probe found. Dixon said on Wednesday that she would not file a lawsuit challenging the election outcome. Spokesmen for the two election boards did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit alleged improper handling of the ballots.

"India's Modi goes to Washington as U.S. partner, but not yet full ally","NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two years ago there were questions over whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could get a visa to enter the United States. Next week he visits Washington as one of President Barack Obama‚Äôs closest international partners. Obama invited Modi for one of the last big visits by a world leader before his term ends in January. Although the trip won‚Äôt feature a lavish state dinner, the Indian leader will address both houses of Congress, considered a rare honor. This will be their seventh meeting since Modi became prime minister in May 2014, an impressive tally for a U.S. president and a leader who is not a formal ally, said Ashley Tellis at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ‚ÄúThe personal relationship between the president and the prime minister ... is really one of the unanticipated surprises of the past two years,‚Äù said Tellis, an expert on India. The developing relationship is seen as an Obama foreign policy success. Washington views India as an important part of its rebalance to Asia and as a counterweight to China. ¬†¬†¬† The two countries are finalizing agreements that would make it possible for their militaries to cooperate more closely, and for U.S. defense manufacturers to both sell and make high-tech weaponry in India. A deal on logistics would govern issues such as how the two countries account for costs of military exercises. Another involves encrypted communications and geospatial data transfer. A history of colonial rule followed by decades of non-alignment has, however, made New Delhi wary of an embrace by the more powerful United States, which has overtaken Russia as India‚Äôs top arms supplier. ‚ÄúIt is neither a strategic partnership nor an alliance,‚Äù said Nitin Gokhale, founder of defense portal Bharat Shakti. ‚ÄúIt can be a long-term arrangement, but to call it a strategic partnership would be premature.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬† There are frustrations, too, on the U.S. side. The two countries reached a civil nuclear agreement in 2005, but it has yet to yield any contracts for U.S.-based companies. Only now is Westinghouse, a unit of Japan‚Äôs Toshiba, approaching the finish line on a deal to build six reactors in India. The visit gives Modi a chance to network with U.S. lawmakers who may feature in a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton administration but, as it coincides with the California primary, he is not expected to meet either. Modi is generally popular with U.S. lawmakers, who extended his invitation to address Congress. But they criticize what they see as lingering unfriendliness to U.S. firms and a stifling bureaucracy, and question New Delhi‚Äôs record on human rights. ‚ÄúThe economic engagement between our two countries should increase and it should be more accessible for U.S. companies,‚Äù Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a telephone interview.  Obama and Modi are expected to discuss India‚Äôs desire to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a 48-member club of nuclear trading nations. India was shut out for decades because of its weapons program, and the civil nuclear agreement with the United States gave it access to foreign suppliers without giving up its arms. Obama administration officials have said they backed India‚Äôs desire to join the group, but the idea faces resistance among some on Capitol Hill, as well as from China, an ally of India‚Äôs arch-rival Pakistan. ‚ÄúExisting NSG guidelines were established to guard against nuclear proliferation, and we should not create exceptions for particular countries,‚Äù Corker said. There is lingering concern in Washington over Modi‚Äôs handling of communal riots in 2002 that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, in Gujarat. Modi was chief minister of the state at the time and, though a court-ordered inquiry found insufficient evidence to prosecute him, the issue prevented him from getting a U.S. visa for years. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised human rights on a visit to New Delhi this week, saying the two largest democracies had ‚Äúspecial obligations‚Äù to set the highest standards. Congress‚Äô Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission has scheduled a hearing on India for June 7, the day Modi arrives in Washington and the day before his address to the combined House of Representatives and Senate. He leaves the United States on June 8. Corker promised to asked Modi about India‚Äôs record on human trafficking, which he brought up recently in an emotional Senate hearing with Obama administration officials. ‚ÄúThe country we believe has 12-14 million slaves, which is close to half the number we believe exists worldwide,‚Äù Corker said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously a very significant issue and when he‚Äôs here, it‚Äôs one I certainly plan to raise.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 "
Republican House Speaker Ryan backs Trump after long courtship,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican, ended a long period of soul-searching and endorsed Donald Trump for president on Thursday, a step toward unifying party loyalists behind the insurgent candidate despite concerns about his candidacy. Ryan had been a high-profile holdout to supporting Trump for the Nov. 8 presidential election out of concern about the presumptive Republican nominee‚Äôs bellicose rhetoric and break with party orthodoxy on issues including trade and immigration. The House of Representatives speaker announced his support in a column for the Janesville Gazette newspaper in his home state of Wisconsin. It surfaced in the middle of a speech by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in which she launched a far-reaching attack on Trump‚Äôs foreign policy credentials. Ryan did not specifically use the word ‚Äúendorse‚Äù in his column, but his spokesman, Brendan Buck, made clear that Ryan‚Äôs move should be seen as an endorsement. The speaker had criticized the Republican candidate several times, including Trump‚Äôs proposal in December to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States because of national security concerns. The 46-year-old Ryan was the only member of the Republican congressional leadership who had not formally embraced Trump. In a tweet, Trump responded: ‚ÄúSo great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs backing of Trump could give cover to more reluctant Republicans to get behind the billionaire businessman as their best chance to win the White House. ‚ÄúI think the endorsement is significant because it shows the falling in line of the establishment Republicans from the top,‚Äù said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. It should also help Trump make the case that he can bring the party together as he girds for a Republican nominating convention in July that many party leaders plan to skip. It also represents a blow to Republicans who have been trying to organize a third-party bid to give party loyalists who cannot abide Trump someone else to support. The ‚Äúnever Trump‚Äù crowd includes 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. Ryan was Romney‚Äôs vice presidential running mate. While Ryan‚Äôs decision could push some Republican leaders off the fence, many holdouts remained, such as two former rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Aides to both said their positions had not changed. Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid described Ryan‚Äôs move as ‚Äúabject surrender,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúThe GOP is Trump‚Äôs party now.‚Äù Ryan met Trump in a high-profile meeting last month and they have since had a number of telephone calls. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no secret that he and I have our differences. I won‚Äôt pretend otherwise,‚Äù Ryan wrote. ‚ÄúAnd when I feel the need to, I‚Äôll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.‚Äù Ryan said he and Trump had spoken many times in recent weeks about how, ‚Äúby focusing on issues that unite Republicans, we can work together to heal the fissures developed through the primary.‚Äù ‚ÄúThrough these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people‚Äôs lives. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll be voting for him this fall,‚Äù Ryan said. Announcing he will vote for Trump should make it a bit more comfortable for Ryan to chair the party‚Äôs nominating convention in Cleveland. While Ryan‚Äôs endorsement was significant for Trump, there remain many concerns about him within the party. Longtime Republican financier Fred Malek drew attention to worries about Trump in a column in the Washington Post on Thursday. He cited Trump‚Äôs criticism last week of New Mexico‚Äôs Republican governor, Susana Martinez, considered a rising star in the party with the ability to appeal to Hispanics. ‚ÄúThese attacks on fellow Republicans must stop as we move closer to the general election,‚Äù Malek wrote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, who has said he will support Trump, told CNN that Trump‚Äôs proposed Muslim ban was a bad idea and that his criticism of Martinez was ill-advised. Ryan said he too still had concerns about Trump‚Äôs tone. ‚ÄúIt is my hope the campaign improves its tone as we go forward and it‚Äôs all a campaign we can be proud of,‚Äù Ryan told the Associated Press.

Sanders to offer Puerto Rico debt bill that would protect pensioners,"(Reuters) - Three days before Puerto Rico‚Äôs Democratic presidential primary, Bernie Sanders leveled a blistering attack on a restructuring bill moving through the U.S. Congress and offered a radically different approach to fixing the territory‚Äôs $70 billion debt problem. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who is giving front-runner Hillary Clinton a tougher-than-expected challenge for the Democratic Party‚Äôs presidential nomination, will formally introduce his legislation next week, a spokesman said on Thursday. Unlike a bipartisan House of Representatives bill that would establish a federal oversight board to renegotiate the massive debt with investors, Sanders‚Äô bill would create a ‚ÄúReconstruction Finance Corporation of Puerto Rico‚Äù that would protect public pensioners from cutbacks and ‚Äúconcentrate losses among vulture funds,‚Äù according to a summary. ‚ÄúIt is morally reprehensible that Wall Street vulture funds are demanding that Puerto Rico fire even more teachers, close more schools, cut pensions and slash the minimum wage so that they can reap huge profits off the misery of the people of Puerto Rico,‚Äù Sanders said in a statement. The term vulture funds is a derogatory reference to specialized investing in deeply discounted or distressed assets, typically bonds, by buying them up on the cheap in hopes of profiting on the expectation of a credit restructuring Clinton has backed the House bill. Last week, a House committee with oversight of Puerto Rico approved a debt restructuring measure that backers hope will be enacted into law before July 1, when the island is faced with making good on $1.9 billion in debt payments. Sanders‚Äô proposal comes as the nominating contests for the presidential election are winding down. Along with Puerto Rico, California and a handful of other states are holding their nominating contests in the coming days. Sanders‚Äô bill sets out to strip the ability of hedge funds to profit off their investments in an attempt to protect pensions ahead of creditors. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation would consist of seven members, all full-time residents of Puerto Rico and mainly chosen by the Puerto Rican legislature and governor. The House bill, by contrast, would give Republicans in the U.S. Congress a say in recommending the majority of the proposed oversight board members. While the House bill boasts no cost to U.S. taxpayers, Sanders wants $10.8 billion for infrastructure improvements in Puerto Rico. He proposes raising federal reimbursements for the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programs for the poor, elderly and disabled. Sanders also wants elections by Jan. 31, 2018, in Puerto Rico to decide whether it should become a state, an independent country or reform its current status. ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 "

"Some officials worry about briefing Trump, fearing spilled secrets","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some U.S. intelligence officials are concerned that Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúshoot from the hip‚Äù style could pose national security risks as they prepare to give him a routine pre-election briefing once he is formally anointed as the Republican presidential nominee. Eight senior security officials told Reuters they had concerns over briefing Trump, whose brash, unpredictable campaign style has been a feature of his rise as an insurgent candidate. Despite their worries, the officials said the ‚ÄúTop Secret‚Äù briefing to each candidate would not deviate from the usual format to avoid any appearance of bias. Most of the officials asked for anonymity to discuss a domestic political issue. Current and former officials said that the scandal over Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of emails also raises concerns about her handling of sensitive information. The likely Democratic nominee is facing an FBI probe into whether security was compromised and laws were broken by her use of a private email server for government business while she was Secretary of State. ‚ÄúThe only candidate who has proven incapable of handling sensitive information is Hillary Clinton,‚Äù said Michael Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ‚ÄúIf there is anyone they should be worried about it is Hillary Clinton.‚Äù¬† But Trump‚Äôs lack of foreign policy experience, his volatile style, and his little known team of foreign policy advisers make him a unique case, the officials said.   ‚ÄúPeople are very nervous,‚Äù said one senior U.S. security official.  Intelligence and other security and foreign policy officials are also trying to determine ‚Äúwho on (Trump‚Äôs) team are trustworthy, the official added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never had a situation like this before. Ever.‚Äù A spokesperson for Trump‚Äôs campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Other officials downplayed such worries, noting that the traditional briefing, while classified as Top Secret, is mostly a broad overview of national security issues and does not include the most sensitive government secrets about intelligence sources and operations.  In the post-Second World War era, confirmed U.S. presidential nominees have traditionally received the briefing from intelligence officials ‚Äî including spy agency chiefs ‚Äî covering a broad range of national security issues. The nominees are usually briefed shortly after their party nominating conventions, and are allowed to include one or two aides who must undergo security checks. Current and former officials say the nominees are explicitly warned not to share the contents of the briefing, which includes detailed intelligence assessments.  After election day, presidents-elect receive the same Presidential Daily Brief, or PDB, that the sitting president gets, complete with material on the intelligence agencies‚Äô sources, methods, and covert operations. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told Reuters that he shared some of the concerns over how Trump, who has never held public office, might use information from the briefing.     ‚ÄúI would be very concerned with Mr. Trump‚Äôs ability to know what he can and can‚Äôt discuss‚Äù publicly about the contents of an intelligence briefing, said Schiff, who has endorsed Clinton for president. Schiff said one consequence of intelligence agencies‚Äô worries about Trump‚Äôs reputation as a loose cannon could be that briefers circumscribe some of the information they provide to Trump and Hillary Clinton, his prospective Democratic opponent. Trump has tended to make broad-brush statements on foreign issues rather than delve into policy nuances. He drew criticism from some former national security officials last month when, without evidence, he quickly tweeted that the downing of an EgyptAir flight appeared to be a terrorist attack.   Clinton is honing in on national security as a key potential weakness for Trump, and is set to deliver a foreign policy speech on Thursday designed to portray the billionaire businessman as unfit for the White House.  Officials familiar with the views and policy of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper‚Äôs Office, which will give the in-person briefings, say it will do its utmost to avoid any suggestions of political favoritism or bias.  Officials say the spy agencies‚Äô intend to follow past practice and give identical briefings to both nominees. One former intelligence official said Clinton could have an advantage in the briefing because she would likely ask more probing questions than Trump, a newcomer to foreign policy. The briefings provide an ‚Äúoverview of pressing issues and hot spots around the world,‚Äù said former CIA officer David Priess, who briefed attorneys general and FBI directors, but not presidents. One U.S. intelligence official said that Trump‚Äôs style may not be such a risk because the briefings are general in nature and often track publicly available information. ‚ÄúIf he reads the papers every day, he won‚Äôt hear much that will surprise him,‚Äù the official said. Current and former officials said that covert operations and the intelligence agencies‚Äô ‚Äúsources and methods,‚Äù which are among the nation‚Äôs most tightly guarded secrets, are never discussed in the pre-election briefings.

Use it or lose it: Occasional Ohio voters may be shut out in November,"CINCINNATI (Reuters) - When Larry Harmon tried to vote on a marijuana initiative in November in his hometown of Kent, Ohio, the 59-year-old software engineer found his name had been struck from the voter rolls. Two hours south in Zanesville, restaurant worker Chris Conrad, 37, was also told he was no longer registered. Both men later found out why: they had not voted often enough. As the Nov. 8 elections loom, officials in Ohio have removed tens of thousands of voters from registration lists because they have not cast a ballot since 2008.  All U.S. states periodically cleanse their voter rolls, but only a handful remove voters simply because they don‚Äôt vote on a regular basis. And nowhere could the practice have a greater potential impact in the state-by-state battle for the White House than Ohio, a swing state that has backed the winner in every presidential election since 1960. Voters of all stripes in Ohio are affected, but the policy appears to be helping Republicans in the state‚Äôs largest metropolitan areas, according to a Reuters survey of voter lists. In the state‚Äôs three largest counties that include Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus, voters have been struck from the rolls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods. That‚Äôs because residents of relatively affluent Republican-leaning neighborhoods are more likely to vote in both congressional elections and presidential contests, historical turnouts show. Democrats are less likely to vote in mid-term elections and thus are more at risk of falling off the rolls.  In the three biggest counties, at least 144,000 voters have been removed, the Reuters analysis found. The statewide total is unclear. Each of the state‚Äôs 88 counties manages its own voter rolls, which generally are not made public.  Unlike other voting-rights disputes that have sparked protests and lawsuits, the practice doesn‚Äôt appear to be driven by one specific party. Both Republican and Democratic officials in Ohio have purged inactive voters over the past 20 years. But neighborhoods that have a high proportion of poor, African-American residents are hit hardest, the Reuters analysis found. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely unfair,‚Äù said Donna Porter-Jones, an organizer at Amos Project, an interfaith group that aims to register 30,000 voters from some of Cincinnati‚Äôs poorest neighborhoods ahead of November.  Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, says canceling registrations for voters who missed three straight federal elections helps keep voting rolls current. Since 2011, the state has cleared out more than 2 million records of people who have moved or died, he said.  Those who don‚Äôt vote over a six-year stretch or respond to a postcard mailed to their address have only themselves to blame, he said. ‚ÄúIf this is really important thing to you in your life, voting, you probably would have done so within a six-year period,‚Äù he said in an interview. People who don‚Äôt respond to the postcard can be removed from voting lists if they sit out the next two federal elections. Many other states only remove voters from the rolls if they have died or moved to a new address. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be struck of your right to vote because you skipped an election,‚Äù said Kathleen Clyde, a Democratic state representative who has been fighting the practice. Four civil liberties groups sued to end the practice last month, arguing that it violates federal law and unfairly targets low-income and minority voters.   Voting-rights advocates say they are concerned that many infrequent voters who helped drive turnout to a record in the 2008 presidential election won‚Äôt be able to vote in this year‚Äôs likely matchup between Democrat Hillary Clinton, vying to become the first female president, and Republican Donald Trump, the celebrity billionaire. The Ohio lawsuit is one of a number being fought across the country. Photo ID requirements and other efforts to tighten voting laws have spurred fierce partisan battles and protests in recent months. They follow a Supreme Court decision in 2013 that struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, a signature achievement of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. The Ohio dispute, by contrast, centers on a practice that has been in place for decades but is receiving new attention from civil liberties groups and Democrats ahead of November.  ‚ÄúWe are pleased the courts are reviewing the state‚Äôs actions,‚Äù said Pratt Wiley, national director of voter expansion at the Democratic Party in Washington. Republican party officials at the local and national level, as well as the Trump campaign, did not respond to requests for comment. But Tom Fitton, the head of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that has pushed Ohio and other states to keep their voting lists up to date, described the lawsuit as a ‚Äúpower play‚Äù by civil liberties groups ‚Äúto ensure that candidates they like are able to steal elections if necessary.‚Äù  Federal law prohibits states from removing voters solely because they haven‚Äôt voted, but it also requires them to keep voter lists up to date. Ohio residents who are removed from voting lists must re-register at least 30 days before an election.  Harmon, the software engineer, backed President Barack Obama in 2008 but has sat out presidential and congressional elections since then. He says he initially thought he had done something wrong to get kicked off the voting rolls. ‚ÄúI felt embarrassed and stupid at the time,‚Äù said Harmon, who is involved in the Ohio lawsuit. ‚ÄúThe more I think about it, the madder I am,‚Äù he said. In Cleveland‚Äôs Cuyahoga County, 5 percent of voters in neighborhoods that backed Obama by more than 60 percent in 2012 were purged last year due to inactivity, according to the Reuters analysis of the voter lists. In neighborhoods where Obama got less than 40 percent of the vote, 2.5 percent of registered voters were removed for that reason. In Franklin County, home to the state capital Columbus, 11 percent of voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods have been purged since 2012 due to inactivity. Only 6 percent of voters in Republican-leaning neighborhoods have been purged.¬†  The disparity is especially stark in Hamilton County, where affluent Republican suburbs ring Cincinnati, which has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the country. In the heavily African-American neighborhoods near downtown, more than 10 percent of registered voters have been removed due to inactivity since 2012. In suburban Indian Hill, only 4 percent have been purged due to inactivity.  Overall, 30,000 voters have been removed due to inactivity since 2012, a larger figure than Obama‚Äôs margin of victory that year. ¬† On a recent rainy afternoon, Amos Project canvasser Marcia Mackey tried to get some of those voters back in the system. Wielding a clipboard and a smile, Mackey asked pedestrians in the Over the Rhine neighborhood north of downtown Cincinnati when they last cast a ballot. If they couldn‚Äôt remember, she encouraged them to register again. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt know they‚Äôve been purged until they go to the election site and get turned away,‚Äù Mackey said. ‚ÄúWe need to make sure that people have voices.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 "
Obama's Supreme Court lawyer to step down,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration‚Äôs top Supreme Court lawyer is leaving office at the end of June having won a string of major cases including fending off challenges to President Barack Obama‚Äôs signature healthcare law and legalizing same-sex marriage. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has served in the Justice Department post since June 2011. He also held two other positions in the Obama administration. Verrilli‚Äôs deputy, Ian Gershengorn will take over, the Justice Department said in a release announcing Verrilli‚Äôs departure. ‚ÄúFor five years, Solicitor General Don Verrilli has fought in our nation‚Äôs highest court for a better future, winning landmark cases that moved America forward,‚Äù Obama said in a statement. Verrilli twice successfully defended the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, against conservative challenges. In 2012, the court ruled 5-4 to uphold the law against a broad legal attack. Three years later, the justices rejected a second challenge on a 6-3 vote. ‚ÄúThanks to his efforts, 20 million more Americans now know the security of quality, affordable health care,‚Äù Obama said. In other major victories, Verrilli urged the justices to strike down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which barred the recognition of same-sex marriages for the purposes of federal benefits. The 5-4 ruling striking down the law in June 2015 helped pave the way for the court‚Äôs 5-4 landmark 2015 decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide, which Verrilli also advocated for.  In another case, Verrilli successfully persuaded the court in 2012 to strike down provisions of a harsh anti-immigrant law in Arizona on a 5-3 vote. ‚ÄúThrough these and many other cases ‚Äì and through his thoughtful counsel and principled advocacy ‚Äì Don has built a legacy of inclusion, expanding opportunities and civil rights for all Americans and moving our country forward,‚Äù Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement. Setbacks included the court‚Äôs 2013 ruling on a 5-4 vote striking down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, a law enacted to protect minority voters. He also lost a case 9-0 in which a company challenged Obama‚Äôs authority to appoint members of the National Labor Relations Board when the Senate was in recess. The court has yet to rule in several major cases Verrilli argued this year, including a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law and his defense of Obama‚Äôs executive action that would protect more than four million immigrants from deportation.

Native Americans move to frontlines in battle over voting rights,"BELCOURT, North Dakota (Reuters) - Elvis Norquay, a member of the Chippewa Indian tribe, has lived most of his 58 years on North Dakota‚Äôs remote Turtle Mountain reservation and says he‚Äôs never had a problem voting. That was before 2014, when he hitched a ride with a friend to cast a ballot in local and congressional elections and was turned away. Embarrassed, he asked why he couldn‚Äôt vote. He was told he lacked proper ID under new state requirements. He has no phone, no current driver‚Äôs license and his tribal ID lacks a street address. ‚ÄúWhen we left, my friend said, ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not right‚Äô,‚Äù said Norquay, who has lived on disability since 2002 in a rural county near the Canadian border. Norquay is among a growing number of Native Americans embroiled in court battles over changes to voting laws that could influence the outcome of some tight races in the November 2016 presidential and congressional elections. While the Native American population is small nationally, lawsuits involving tribes over voting problems have proliferated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. North Dakota is one of 17 states that have new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Many of these changes have sparked lawsuits and accusations that black, Hispanic and other minority voters could be disenfranchised. Five federal lawsuits involving Native Americans have been filed since the Supreme Court decision, including three this year alone. Suits in North Dakota, Utah, South Dakota and Arizona claim new voting rules passed in majority Republican states are discriminatory and could reduce voting by tribal members, who tend to back Democrats. A suit in Alaska, for example, claimed the state violated federal rules by failing to translate voting materials for tribal voters. The tribes say changes to voting rules in those states disproportionately affect Native Americans, an allegation the states and counties deny. The Native American vote is not big enough to flip a safe Republican state such as North Dakota into the Democrat column in this year‚Äôs presidential election, but Native Americans are a growing proportion of the population and a majority in some counties where increased voter turnout in recent years has tipped the balance in some congressional races. In many states, the number of Native Americans is growing faster than the population as a whole. Between 2000 and 2010, the Native American population rose by 26.7 percent to 1.1 million, compared to 9.7 percent growth in America‚Äôs overall population, census data showed. Recent changes to voting laws, such as North Dakota‚Äôs new voter ID law, are part of ‚Äúa much broader, deliberate, and concerted effort by Republicans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters on election day,‚Äù said Pratt Wiley, head of voter protection issues at the Democratic Party in Washington. ‚ÄúThose voters are more vulnerable today than they were before the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013,‚Äù he said of Native Americans. Republicans deny that voting law changes passed by Republican-dominated legislatures are discriminatory and say they are intended to reduce fraudulent votes. ‚ÄúThese are popular common sense laws to protect elections from fraud,‚Äù said Lindsay Walters, national spokeswoman at the Republican National Committee. At issue in North Dakota are revisions pushed largely by Republican state legislators in 2013 and 2015 to a 2003 state elections law that eliminated a provision that had allowed people without proper identification such as Norquay to vote if they were recognized by a poll worker or if they signed an affidavit swearing to their identity. Norquay and six other members of his tribe sued the secretary of state in January in U.S. District Court in North Dakota. They said they were refused the right to vote in November 2014 because many old tribal IDs such as Norquay‚Äôs don‚Äôt list a current residential address.  It says some tribal members can‚Äôt afford a new tribal ID or struggle to obtain proper identification because there are no state offices that provide driver‚Äôs licenses on the reservations.  Richard McCloud, chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, said widespread unemployment and poverty among tribal members meant that some struggle to afford the $10 needed to obtain a new tribal card.  ‚ÄúTen dollars is three pounds of hamburger and some macaroni for a family,‚Äù said McCloud at the tribe‚Äôs headquarters on the reservation of about 4,274 people a few miles (km) south of the Canadian border. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs no big deal if you work, but it‚Äôs a big deal to people that don‚Äôt have access to $10,‚Äù he said. North Dakota‚Äôs secretary of state, Al Jaeger, the only defendant in the suit, said in an interview that the law is not discriminatory and simplifies the voting process in the only state in the country that does not require voters to register ahead of an election. He said his office has spent heavily on ad campaigns to educate voters about what IDs are accepted. Jaeger‚Äôs deputy, Jim Silrum, said the ID requirements are not a barrier for the 97 percent of state residents with driver‚Äôs licenses, an accepted form of ID, so the number of people affected by the changes is miniscule. Those with no driver‚Äôs license, can get a non-driver state ID allowed at the polls from the motor vehicle department for free. Jaeger and Silrum said they could not respond directly to an assertion in the lawsuit that residents on reservations have to travel long distances to obtain a state ID. Republican state Representative Jim Kasper from Fargo repeated his party‚Äôs argument that the changes were aimed at reducing the risk of voter fraud, but Silrum said there was little evidence of such irregularities. In the 2012 presidential election, there were only nine cases of people voting twice, but that was because they used the same ID rather than a lack of proper identification, he said. State Representative Kylie Oversen, a Democrat from Grand Forks, said the changes could alter tight elections in favor of Republicans. She said Republicans pushed for the bill after Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012 by less than 3,000 votes. In sparsely populated states such as North Dakota, with just 739,000 people, congressional elections have been decided by just a few thousand votes. Rolette County, surrounding Norquay‚Äôs reservation, is one of two counties in the state where about 75 percent of the population is Native American. Those two counties were the only places in North Dakota that gave President Barack Obama more than 70 percent of the vote in 2012. After the changes in the ID law were implemented in North Dakota, voter turnout in Rolette County dropped by more than 12 percentage points between the 2010 and 2014 mid-term elections, more than any other county in the state, election data from the secretary of state‚Äôs office shows. ‚ÄúWhat has happened is the Native American vote has become something that can tip elections,‚Äù said Jean Schroedel, a professor at Claremont Graduate University in California who studies Native American voting. The Native American Rights Fund, a non-profit law firm representing Norquay and other members of his tribe in the lawsuit against the state, plans to file a motion by June 30 requesting that the court invalidate the changes to the ID law ahead of November‚Äôs election, according to court documents.

Thousands of voters in limbo after Kansas demands proof they're American,"WICHITA, Kansas (Reuters) - After moving to Kansas, Tad Stricker visited a state motor vehicle office to perform what he thought was the routine task of getting a new driver‚Äôs license and registering to vote. It was a familiar procedure for Stricker, 37, who has moved from state to state frequently in his work as a hotel manager. He filled out a voter registration form and got his driver‚Äôs license. He was not asked for more documents, he said. So he was stunned when he tried to cast a ballot in November 2014 and was told he was not on the voter rolls. A month later, a letter from the state said why: His registration had been placed ‚Äúin suspense‚Äù because he had failed to meet a state requirement he did not know about - proving he was an American. Spurred by Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a national leader in pushing for anti-immigration and voting changes, more than 36,000 Kansas residents have joined Stricker in limbo since early 2013 under a state law that raises a new and higher barrier to voting in the United States: proof of citizenship. While you must be a U.S. citizen to vote in American elections, most states allow those wishing to register to simply sign a statement affirming they are citizens and provide a driver‚Äôs license number, Social Security number, or other proof of residency.¬† A Reuters analysis of the Kansas suspense list shows the law disproportionately hits young voters, who often do not have ready access to the needed documents, as well as unaffiliated and Democratic voters in the Republican-controlled state. ‚ÄúWhat a shock,‚Äù said Stricker, who was born in Missouri and moved to Kansas with his wife from Illinois. ‚ÄúI was under the impression I had registered to vote, I had done everything I needed to. I just thought, ‚ÄòThis can‚Äôt be happening.‚Äô‚Äù While the law won‚Äôt affect its status as a safe Republican state in November‚Äôs presidential election, it thrusts Kansas into a national debate over voting restrictions that has accelerated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. Kobach‚Äôs involvement has raised the stakes in the fight against the Kansas law. Democrats and voting rights advocates say his influence with conservatives could help spread the concept to other states. His critics scored a victory on May 17 when a federal judge weakened the law. Kobach quickly appealed. The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, and Stricker was a plaintiff in the case. Photo identification laws and other voting measures have proliferated in recent years in Republican-held states, but ‚Äúthe one that gets me most nervous‚Äù is the proof of citizenship requirement in Kansas, said Pratt Wiley, director of voter expansion for the Democratic National Committee. ‚ÄúWhat you will see is that what is learned in one state, or doesn‚Äôt work in one state, there is a small adjustment and then it‚Äôs applied in a different state,‚Äù Wiley said, calling Kansas ‚Äúpatient zero‚Äù in that process. Kobach has gained a national reputation for pushing a series of voting and anti-immigration measures across the country, leading one Democratic congressman to dub him ‚Äúthe dark lord‚Äù of the anti-immigration movement - a label he wears proudly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I would call it a badge of honor but it reflects that I‚Äôm moving the ball in what I think is the right direction,‚Äù Kobach said in an interview in his Topeka office across from the state Capitol. Three other states have adopted proof of citizenship laws championed by Kobach, although officials said two of them had not implemented them. Bills have been introduced in at least nine other states to create a similar law since 2012, although none have advanced very far, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The law Kobach spearheaded in Kansas requires registrants to prove their citizenship by providing one of a series of documents, including birth certificates and passports. They are placed on the suspense list if they can‚Äôt. Since late last year, those who did not complete the requirements for registration have been purged from the voter rolls after 90 days and had to begin the process over again. About 14 percent of Kansans who tried to register between the law‚Äôs onset in 2013 and late 2015 failed to meet the requirement and went on the suspense list, according to documents filed in a lawsuit challenging the requirement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs created a system that is needlessly complex and very discouraging, particularly for young people,‚Äù said Steve Lopes, head of the Johnson County Voting Coalition, which helps register voters. ‚ÄúNow people just say, ‚ÄòForget it, I‚Äôm not going to vote‚Äô.‚Äù Kobach rejects accusations the law is designed to suppress voter turnout, particularly among minority and low-income voters who tend to back Democrats. He says it is aimed at stopping what he describes as a rampant problem of non-citizens voting in U.S. elections - even though there is little evidence of the problem. ‚ÄúEvery time an alien votes, it cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen. That‚Äôs real disenfranchisement, it‚Äôs happening every election and it‚Äôs happening in every state,‚Äù Kobach said, estimating thousands of non-citizens are on voting rolls in big states with large immigrant populations. Citing that threat, Kobach convinced the Kansas legislature in 2015 to give him the power to prosecute voter fraud. But he has won just four misdemeanor illegal voting convictions, mostly involving people who owned at least two properties and cast votes in both locations. None involved non-citizens voting, although Kobach said more complaints will be filed. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson, who issued a May 17 order that Kansas begin to register more than 18,000 voters kept off the rolls by the proof of citizenship law, noted Kansas could identify only three non-citizens who voted between 2003 and the onset of the law in 2013. ‚ÄúThe court cannot find that the state‚Äôs interest in preventing non-citizens from voting in Kansas outweighs the risk of disenfranchising thousands of qualified voters,‚Äù she wrote. Of the 16,775 people on a late-April suspense list obtained by Reuters, more than half were ages 17 through 21, and more than 60 percent were age 25 or under. They were clustered in the high-population areas of Wichita, Topeka and the Kansas City suburbs, and the college towns of Lawrence and Manhattan. About 41 percent were unaffiliated, more than the approximately 30 percent of registered Kansas voters who are unaffiliated. About 35 percent of those on the list were Democrats, compared to 24 percent of registered voters. Twenty-three percent were Republicans, compared to 45 percent of registered voters, according to a Reuters analysis of the data. Younger voters, who are more likely to register as unaffiliated or Democrats, have a harder time getting the documents needed and have less patience with what has become an unwieldy process, said Michael Smith, a professor at Emporia State University who has studied the Kansas suspense list. Kobach said it was ‚Äúnatural‚Äù that young people were heavily represented on the suspense list because they are the majority of new registrants. He rejected criticism that a proof of citizenship requirement created a higher barrier for registrants. ‚ÄúIf you define a barrier to voting as just having to do something before you vote, every state has that barrier, virtually every state requires proof of address,‚Äù he said.  In her court ruling, Robinson said the Kansas requirement conflicted with a federal law designed to make it easier to register while getting a driver‚Äôs license. She ordered Kansas on June 14 to begin registering Stricker and other residents who had submitted voter applications through state motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of citizenship. They will be able to vote in federal elections for the presidency and U.S. Congress.   But Robinson‚Äôs ruling did not end the proof of citizenship requirement for Kansans who register by mail or at locations other than motor vehicle offices, and it left even those registering while getting a driver‚Äôs license ineligible to vote for state and local offices. For now, that has created a chaotic two-tier system where some Kansans can vote in state elections and some cannot, some need to provide proof of citizenship and others do not, and many county election officials are uncertain how to proceed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a complete mess,‚Äù said Marge Ahrens, co-president of the nonpartisan Kansas League of Women Voters.

Commentary: How long before North Korea can nuke a U.S. city?,"It‚Äôs the near future, and North Korea‚Äôs regime is on the brink of collapse. As rumors swirl of palace coups, forces on both sides of the world‚Äôs most militarized border are on heightened alert. The U.S. military faces a much bigger problem. Somewhere in the Pacific, a North Korean submarine is believed to be carrying nuclear warheads and the missiles to deliver them. And nobody knows where it is.  It sounds like the plot of a ‚ÄúHunt for Red October‚Äù-style technothriller. But if Pyongyang‚Äôs technicians continue at their current pace, experts say it is becoming ever more likely.  One thing is certain: North Korea is plowing considerable resources into building its nuclear capability. And it is clearly making progress ‚Äì even if Tuesday‚Äôs failed missile test shows it still has a long way to go.  Japanese officials said what appeared to be a conventional Musudan rocket, which theoretically has the ability to reach Japan and the U.S. territory and military base of Guam, exploded either as or shortly after it left its launcher. North Korea is estimated to have some 20 to 30 of the missiles ‚Äì first deployed in 2007, but yet to be launched successfully.  What North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wants, most analysts believe, is simple ‚Äì a rocket that can fire a nuclear warhead at least to regional targets. His ultimate ambition, however, is to be able to hit U.S. cities on the West Coast, most likely from a submarine that could hide itself at sea.  North Korea has been steadily improving its rockets ‚Äì which can also carry conventional explosives ‚Äì for decades. It detonated its first nuclear device in 2006 but most experts believe it has yet to build one small enough to be placed on a missile. Having the credible ability to do all of that and get the missiles to sea could take well over a decade, perhaps considerably more.  Once it happens, however, it will be a strategic game changer. At worst, U.S. cities on the West Coast would have to deal with the prospect, however remote, that they might be struck by a North Korean atomic weapon. At the very least, a North Korea armed with nuclear submarines would hugely complicate the calculus for any U.S. president handling a crisis on the Korean peninsula itself.  That, of course, is exactly the plan.  The fact that Pyongyang has conducted so many tests this year, some experts believe, suggests Kim is pushing his scientists harder than ever to deliver working rockets and warheads. North Korea is believed to have tagged the expertise of Russian Cold War-era scientists, and while its capabilities on both fronts lag well behind established nuclear states such as Russia and China, it is already believed to be well ahead of Iran.  In April, South Korean and U.S. officials said a North Korean submarine successfully launched a ballistic missile that traveled some 18 miles ‚Äî a major step forward.  Technical experts say TV footage appeared to show a solid fuel rocket successfully launching from underwater, essentially the same system used by Western forces to achieve the same goal.  When she testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in April, the incoming head of the U.S. Northern Command ‚Äì responsible for defending the mainland United States ‚Äì delivered a stark warning.  ‚ÄúThe North Korean threat is real,‚Äù U.S. Air Force General Lori Robinson ‚Äì previously head of U.S. air forces in the Pacific ‚Äì told lawmakers. ‚ÄúFor now, it‚Äôs a medium range but they are trying very hard to be able to hit the homeland.‚Äù  It‚Äôs impossible to know exactly how much money and expertise the North Koreans are expending. The scale of the effort, however, is seen as large ‚Äì in many ways, the same level of commitment the United States gave to the Manhattan Project to build the world‚Äôs first atomic bomb during World War Two. Pyongyang‚Äôs reason is clear: building that kind of credible ability to strike is seen as central to the long-term survival of the Kim dynasty and its ruling party.  Earlier this month, at the first meeting of its ruling party in 36 years, Kim said North Korea was a responsible nuclear weapons state and would never use its weapons ‚Äì unless it were threatened. That seemed a clear warning to outside powers, particularly Washington, to steer clear of any attempts to destabilize or attack the regime.  Getting a submarine-based deterrent would be a very big deal ‚Äì and not just because it might allow the North Koreans to move the launch point much closer to the target. Submarines are central to what nuclear weapons states call a ‚Äúsecond strike‚Äù capability, the ability to launch missiles even in the aftermath of an overwhelming and perhaps surprise preemptive attack.  The United States, Russia, Britain and France all retain what they call a ‚Äúcontinuous at sea deterrent,‚Äù at least one submarine offshore at all times ready to fight back even if the homeland and all other military forces are completely taken out. Israel is also believed to have the ability to mount nuclear cruise missiles on its Dolphin-class conventional submarines, while China is now moving quickly towards new ballistic missile submarines for its own at sea deterrent.  This technology isn‚Äôt new ‚Äì the United States and Russia developed it in the late 1950s based in part on plans originally developed to hit Nazi German U-boats in the dying days of World War Two. There is no good reason it should not eventually work for North Korea, too.  If and when it does, Pyongyang is likely to try to keep its submarines very close to its coasts‚Äîand its home defenses‚Äîat first. Still, once the first nuclear-armed submarine exists, Japan and the United States might feel political pressure to destroy it.  That would come with considerable risks. The North is known to have huge volumes of conventional artillery based along the South Korean border, much of it in range of Seoul and its 10 million residents. The risk of those weapons inflicting massive casualties is one of the key factors that has deterred multiple U.S. administrations from considering the kind of preemptive strike on Pyongyang‚Äôs weapons programs that the United States has threatened against Iran.  The Korean War ‚Äì frozen by its 1953 cease-fire but never otherwise resolved ‚Äì may not be over yet.  ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 "
"North Korea says Trump isn't screwy at all, a wise choice for president"," SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has backed presumptive U.S. Republican nominee Donald Trump, with a propaganda website praising him as ‚Äúa prescient presidential candidate‚Äù who can liberate Americans living under daily fear of nuclear attack by the North.  A column carried on Tuesday by DPRK Today, one of the reclusive and dynastic state‚Äôs mouthpieces, described Trump as a ‚Äúwise politician‚Äù and the right choice for U.S. voters in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.  MORE FROM REUTERS: Tesla gets vote of confidence from a top investor at Fidelity Breakingviews:¬†Banking ghosts haunt Clinton in Philadelphia How oil traders fell for Yahoo It described his most likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, as ‚Äúthick-headed Hillary‚Äù over her proposal to apply the Iran model of wide sanctions to resolve the nuclear weapons issue on the Korean peninsula.  Trump instead has told Reuters he was prepared to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang‚Äôs nuclear program, and that China should also help solve the problem.  North Korea, known officially as the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK), is under U.N. sanctions over its past nuclear tests. South Korea and the United States say its calls for dialogue are meaningless until it takes steps to end its nuclear ambitions.  DPRK Today also said Trump‚Äôs suggestion that the United States should pull its troops from South Korea until Seoul pays more was the way to achieve Korean unification.  ‚ÄúIt turns out that Trump is not the rough-talking, screwy, ignorant candidate they say he is, but is actually a wise politician and a prescient presidential candidate,‚Äù said the column, written by a China-based Korean scholar identified as Han Yong Muk.  DPRK Today is among a handful of news sites run by the isolated North, although its content is not always handled by the main state-run media.  It said promising to resolve issues on the Korean peninsula through ‚Äúnegotiations and not war‚Äù was the best option for America, which it said is ‚Äúliving every minute and second on pins and needles in fear of a nuclear strike‚Äù by North Korea.  The North has for years called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the South as the first step toward peace on the Korean peninsula and demanded Washington sign a peace treaty to replace the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.  Its frequently strident rhetoric also often threatens nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States.  ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 "
U.S. expects to continue strong Philippines alliance despite Duterte signal,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The United States expects to maintain its strong security relationship with the Philippines, including a recent accord on the rotational stationing of U.S. forces, U.S. officials said on Thursday, despite signals from the incoming Philippine president that he will chart a more independent course. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, speaking en route to a security conference in Singapore at which a case over disputed South China Sea territory brought by the previous Philippine government against China will be a key talking point, said Washington took its treaty alliance with the Philippines ‚Äúvery seriously.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs long standing, it is, we say, ironclad,‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúThey have a new government there and we look forward to working with them, talking with them about our alliance, about security affairs in the region.‚Äù Asked about an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) he signed in Manila weeks ago giving the United States rotational access to five bases in the Philippines, Carter replied: ‚ÄúOur plans for EDCA and implementation are on track; we haven‚Äôt changed our plans at all.‚Äù On Tuesday, Philippines President-elect Rodrigo Duterte, who is due to take over on June 30, signaled greater independence in dealing with China and broader security issues, when he told reporters future policy would ‚Äúnot be dependent on America.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have this pact with the West, but I want everybody to know that we will be charting a course of our own,‚Äù Duterte said, when asked if he would push for bilateral talks with China. On Wednesday, Duterte‚Äôs incoming foreign minister, Perfecto Yasay, told Reuters Manila would honor treaties with the United States, including the EDCA, but it ‚Äúshould not be a lackey of any nation.‚Äù The outgoing Philippines government has been one of Washington‚Äôs staunchest supporters in its standoff with China over its expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea, a vital global trade route. Washington has been supportive of a case Manila has brought in the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague challenging China‚Äôs claims. Carter is expected to urge regional nations attending the annual Shangri-la Dialogue to rally around the U.S. position that the court‚Äôs ruling, which is expected to go in Manila‚Äôs favor, must be binding. Another U.S. defense official, who did not want to be identified, said Washington expected to continue its strong alliance with the Philippines, but added: ‚ÄúWe certainly understand the Philippine desire to chart their own course and everything we do with respect to our alliance ... is designed to allow the Philippines to chart its own course.‚Äù Asked whether the United States had detected any decrease in desire on the part of the Philippines to take part in joint South China Sea patrols or to commit to more force rotations under the EDCA, the official replied: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early to tell. We‚Äôll get together with the government when they come in and I‚Äôm sure we will have very thorough discussions about all of this when the time comes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe first tranche of forces has rotated out. And we will be discussing with the Philippines possible future (deployments).‚Äù Duterte has yet to name a defense minister and Carter said he had no meeting planned with the Philippines delegation at the Singapore meeting.  Carter also said he did not plan a separate meeting with the Chinese, but looked forward to seeing members of their delegation over the three-day conference from Friday.

U.S. takes further steps to block North Korea's access to financial system,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday declared North Korea a ‚Äúprimary money laundering concern‚Äù and moved to further block its ability to use the U.S. and world financial systems to fund its weapons programs. The U.S. Treasury Department called for a prohibition on certain U.S. financial institutions opening or maintaining correspondent accounts, which are established to receive deposits from or make payments on behalf of a foreign institution, with North Korean financial institutions. Crucially, Treasury also prohibited the use of third parties‚Äô U.S. correspondent accounts to process transactions for North Korean financial institutions. The announcement came days after the latest failed missile launch by the isolated state. Tensions in the region have been high since January when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test and then followed that with a satellite launch and test launches of various missiles, in defiance of UN resolutions. Those efforts have all fueled calls in Washington, and abroad, for a clampdown on Pyongyang. U.S. law already generally prohibited U.S. financial institutions from engaging in transactions with North Korean institutions, but Treasury‚Äôs latest actions would impose additional controls, especially the prohibition on the use of third-country banks‚Äô U.S. accounts to process transactions for North Korea. ‚ÄúThis is meaningful,‚Äù said Victor Cha, Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ‚ÄúThis is designating the entire country, which means essentially that any entity that is interested in interacting with U.S. financial institutions should no longer have any business with North Korea.‚Äù ‚ÄúMost, if not all, entities, if faced with the choice of having access to the U.S. financial system or doing business with North Korea, are going to make the obvious choice,‚Äù Cha added. South Korea‚Äôs foreign ministry on Thursday welcomed the move, which it said in a statement would boost the effectiveness of existing sanctions on the North and have a broader impact than a 2005 U.S. Treasury measure that targeted a bank in the Chinese territory of Macau. But China, North Korea‚Äôs most important backer despite Beijing‚Äôs anger at Pyongyang‚Äôs nuclear program and support for U.N. sanctions, expressed concern. ‚ÄúWe have consistently opposed any county using its domestic law to impose unilateral sanctions on another country,‚Äù Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. About $24 million of North Korean funds was frozen at Macau‚Äôs Banco Delta Asia (BDA) after the U.S. Treasury accused it of helping to channel earnings from the North‚Äôs illicit activities, leading to a frantic attempt by Pyongyang to retrieve the money. The North has since developed tactics to skirt financial restrictions by resorting to informal means to transfer money, including the use of bulk cash hand-carried by officials.      Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said Washington expected other governments and financial authorities to make similar moves to prevent Pyongyang from ‚Äúabusing‚Äù global financial institutions to support its development of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. ‚ÄúThe regime is notoriously deceitful in its financial transactions in order to continue its illicit weapons programs and other destabilizing activities,‚Äù Szubin said in a statement. The Treasury was required to assess North Korea‚Äôs status as a money laundering jurisdiction under the ‚ÄúNorth Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act,‚Äù passed nearly unanimously by the U.S. Congress in February. A U.N. Security Council resolution in early March also required member states to sever correspondent banking relationships with North Korean financial institutions within 90 days.

Trump blasts PGA Tour for plan to move golf tournament to Mexico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a golf resort developer who has railed against Mexico in the 2016 campaign, lost an important golf tournament to that country on Wednesday when the PGA Tour said it would leave his Trump Doral course in Miami. Although the PGA Tour said it was not a political decision, Trump said in a statement the move was akin to decisions by some U.S. companies to move jobs to Mexico, which has been a refrain of his presidential campaign. ‚ÄúThe PGA Tour has put profit ahead of thousands of American jobs, millions of dollars in revenue for local communities and charities and the enjoyment of hundreds of thousands of fans who make the tournament an annual tradition,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis decision only further embodies the very reason I am running for president of the United States.‚Äù The PGA said the World Golf Championship event would move from Trump National Doral to a site in Mexico City and be sponsored by the Grupo Salinas conglomerate. PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said the move was necessary ‚Äúonce it became apparent that we would not be able to secure sponsorship at levels that would sustain the event and help it grow at Trump National Doral.‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom a golf standpoint, we have no issues with Donald Trump. From a political standpoint, we are neutral. The PGA Tour has never been involved or cares to be involved in presidential politics,‚Äù Finchem told a news conference in Dublin, Ohio. Cadillac has been the title sponsor for the event in recent years including this year‚Äôs tournament in March. Cadillac representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Trump‚Äôs son Eric Trump said Cadillac had been willing to continue. ‚ÄúCadillac is ready, willing and able to continue as title sponsor for the tournament,‚Äù he told Reuters. ‚ÄúAnd I also can say that Cadillac is an amazing company and a longtime partner to the Trump Organization and we have an impeccable relationship.‚Äù The Doral tournament is one of the biggest pro golf events of the year, drawing top golfers from around the world competing for a $6 million purse. The Doral course has hosted a PGA tournament since 1962. Trump, whose golf empire includes 18 courses, purchased the golf resort in 2012 and led a $250 million renovation of its Blue Monster course where the PGA tournament has been played. The news about Doral surfaced on the same day that Trump announced he would step away from the campaign trail later this month to travel to Scotland for the reopening of the Turnberry golf resort, which he bought in 2014.

Obama says transgender bathroom directive based on law,"ELKHART, Ind. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday the decision to direct public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice was based on the law and the best interests of the children. Speaking at a town hall event broadcast by the PBS television network, Obama, a Democrat, said the federal government waded into the controversial issue after school districts asked the Education Department for guidance. Republicans have blasted the directive as executive branch overreach, and more than a dozen states have sued the Obama administration to block it.     ‚ÄúWhat happened and what continues to happen is you have transgender kids in schools. And they get bullied. And they get ostracized. And it‚Äôs tough for them,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúMy best interpretation of what our laws and our obligations are is that we should try to accommodate these kids so that they are not in a vulnerable situation,‚Äù he said. On May 13, the federal government told public schools they must allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The non-binding guidance contained the implicit threat of cuts in federal funding if it was not followed. It relied on an interpretation of Title IX, which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education initiatives that receive federal financial assistance. The directive came as the Justice Department and North Carolina battled in federal court over a North Carolina state law approved in March that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to the sex on their birth certificates. Other states are weighing similar measures. ‚ÄúWe should deal with this issue the same way we would want it dealt with if it was our child and that is to try to create an environment of some dignity and kindness for these kids,‚Äù Obama said. Obama said there ‚Äúare a lot of things more pressing‚Äù than the transgender bathroom controversy, including Islamic State, the economy and jobs. ‚ÄúSomehow people think I made it an issue. I didn‚Äôt make it an issue,‚Äù he said. ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 "
"Battling to hold off Sanders, Democrat Clinton to assail Trump on foreign policy","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign on Wednesday signaled plans for a big assault on Republican Donald Trump, even as she battles to hold off rival Bernie Sanders in California. Clinton, a former secretary of state, is to deliver what her campaign described as a major speech on Thursday in San Diego to underscore what she feels would be the threat posed by Trump to U.S. national security if he is elected president on Nov. 8. Her language to describe Trump has grown more aggressive by the day. On Wednesday, she seized on testimony released in a lawsuit against Trump University, in which some former workers said they believed Trump‚Äôs for-profit school was fraudulent. ‚ÄúTrump and his employees took advantage of vulnerable Americans encouraging them to max out their credit cards, empty their retirement savings, destroy their financial futures, all while making promises they knew were false from the beginning,‚Äù Clinton told a campaign event in Newark, New Jersey. ‚ÄúThis is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud.‚Äù Lawyers for Trump have said most students were satisfied with Trump University, dismissing the former workers‚Äô testimony as discredited. Trump, anticipating Clinton‚Äôs foreign policy attacks on him, tried to raise doubts about her leadership skills at a rally in Sacramento, Calif. ‚ÄúShe is a person with absolutely no natural talent,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll you have to do is watch her speak.‚Äù Repeatedly referring to Clinton as ‚Äúcrooked Hillary,‚Äù Trump sharply criticized her handling of foreign policy, including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamic militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador. ‚ÄúShe went to sleep,‚Äù Trump added. Clinton‚Äôs effort to define Trump as unfit to be commander in chief comes as she faces fierce opposition from Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who has insisted on staying in the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination despite Clinton‚Äôs nearly insurmountable lead. California‚Äôs primary next Tuesday is shaping up to be pivotal in the Democratic contest, with Clinton holding a 13-point advantage over Sanders, 51 percent to 38 percent, according to the Hoover Institution‚Äôs Golden State Poll in the state. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll gave Clinton a much narrower lead of 49 percent, to 47 percent for Sanders. Clinton, with 2,312 delegates, needs 71 more delegates to reach the required 2,383 for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has 1,545. At stake in the California primary are 548 delegates who are awarded proportional to the vote. Five other states also vote next Tuesday, including New Jersey, which could also turn the tide for Clinton. Despite Clinton‚Äôs perceived advantage, there are lingering concerns among some Democrats about possible weakness, given the protracted battle with Sanders, a democratic socialist whose calls for free college tuition have energized young voters. Doug Schoen, a Democratic pollster, wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that California voters appeared to be leaning toward Sanders in recent days. Sanders has been holding events every day this week in the state. Clinton canceled a New Jersey event planned for Thursday to go to California a day earlier than anticipated and is to stay there until Monday. ‚ÄúThe inevitability behind Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs nomination will be in large measure eviscerated if she loses the June 7 California primary to Bernie Sanders,‚Äù Schoen wrote. ‚ÄúThat could well happen.‚Äù Other Democrats expressed confidence in Clinton‚Äôs position and her move to assail Trump on foreign policy. ‚ÄúI think she has to,‚Äù said Democratic strategist Jim Manley. ‚ÄúLeaving aside California, I think they can‚Äôt just ignore Donald Trump in that they should be spending a majority of time focusing on him instead of Sanders at this point, because based on the math Sanders can‚Äôt win.‚Äù Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has faced criticism for a variety of positions on foreign policy, such as his willingness to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his idea that Japan and South Korea might need to develop nuclear arsenals. On the other hand, past Republican presidents and current Democratic President Barack Obama have, like Trump, said NATO nations should pay more for their defense to ease the U.S. burden. Trump, however, has declared NATO obsolete and in need of reconfiguring. A Clinton aide said Clinton, the wife of former President Bill Clinton, would say Trump had not outlined a coherent foreign policy doctrine and had proven himself to be temperamentally unfit to serve as president.

Moynihan was put on the spot by billionaire investor Wilbur Ross at an annual fundraising dinner for the Japan Society in New York when he was asked about a possible Trump presidency. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made it my personal practice‚Äîbecause when you run a big company‚ÄîI do not say ‚Äòcandidate A versus candidate B‚Äô but what I think we need as we think about transition is we need a leader for the whole country,‚Äù Moynihan said.  Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2016 presidential election, has faced criticism on a variety of issues, including his position on trade, immigration and foreign policy. ‚ÄúI have high confidence that the powers of office will be able to shape people into being what‚Äôs good for America. If they‚Äôre really answering that question I think at the end of the day Bank of America will be fine,‚Äù said Moynihan.  Ross, who is Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer at Invesco Ltd subsidiary WL Ross & Co, interviewed Moynihan on stage for 20 minutes as guests ate the first course of cold smoked fish.

California Assembly passes gun control bills,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The California Assembly on Wednesday passed a package of gun control bills, including a measure to ban so-called bullet buttons which allow quick changes in the magazine of a military-style weapon. The bills, which lawmakers are pushing the Senate to consider this month, are among several gun control measures that leaders of both houses want to pass in advance of a gun control referendum headed for the November ballot.  The measures include a ban on so-called bullet buttons which supporters say allow gun manufacturers to bypass the state‚Äôs prohibition on removable ammunition magazines. Weapons owned by the shooters in December‚Äôs San Bernardino massacre were equipped with bullet buttons. The bill passed on the same day that the University of California, Los Angeles campus was shut down in the wake of a murder-suicide shooting.  Also passed was a bill to allow employers, co-workers, mental health workers and school employees to ask a judge to ban someone from possessing a gun for up to a year. The state already allows family members to seek such a ban, known as a gun violence restraining order, against relatives whom a judge rules are at high risk of committing violence against themselves or others with a firearm. A spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition was not immediately available for comment.      Last month, the California State Senate passed its own package of bills, which would prohibit possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, require greater scrutiny of ammunition purchasers and seek to better keep guns out of the hands of violent felons. Led by Senate Democratic leader Kevin de Leon, California senators are rushing to pass the gun control bills in part to defuse a ballot initiative on the same subject backed by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. Democrats in the Legislature fear that Newsom‚Äôs measure, a centerpiece of his campaign so far, along with an initiative to legalize marijuana, will draw Republicans who oppose gun control to the polls, potentially influencing other races. De Leon, who has not endorsed Newsom or announced his own plans for 2018, has said he believes that laws passed by the Legislature are more nuanced and easily adjustable than those instead created through a referendum. Second amendment advocates have steadfastly opposed all of the measures. ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 "
Archived State Department briefing video deliberately cut,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Part of a U.S. State Department briefing video about secret U.S.-Iran nuclear talks was deliberately deleted at the request of an unknown official before it was posted to an online archive, the department said on Wednesday. The excised portion of the Dec. 2, 2013, briefing included a question about whether an earlier spokeswoman for the department had misled reporters about whether the United States was holding secret direct nuclear talks with Iran. The State Department initially said it believed a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù caused the gap but on Wednesday said an internal inquiry found it was a deliberate omission. However, it said no rules were broken because none existed governing the integrity of the briefing transcript and video. Rules are now being put in place. The inquiry was carried out by the department‚Äôs Office of the Legal Adviser at the request of State Department spokesman John Kirby, who is also assistant secretary of the department‚Äôs Bureau of Public Affairs. ‚ÄúIn so doing, they learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,‚Äù Kirby told reporters at his daily briefing. The video editor who received the request by telephone ‚Äúdoes not remember anything other than that the caller was passing on a request from someone else in the (Public Affairs) bureau,‚Äù Kirby added. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. State Department official said the editor discussed the request with her supervisor and concluded that it came from a ‚Äúlevel of credibility and authority‚Äù high enough that they should act on the request. Kirby said the video had been replaced some time ago with a full version that was archived with the Defense Department. He said the transcript of the briefing had always been available online and had not been modified. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 "
Obama slams Trump for promising to roll back Wall Street reforms,"ELKHART, Ind. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama slammed Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal to weaken Wall Street reforms and touted his own economic record on Wednesday during a trip to a city he visited three weeks into his presidency that has recovered from its recession lows. Obama‚Äôs remarks in Elkhart, Indiana, foreshadowed the arguments he is likely to make on the campaign trail this fall against the likely Republican presidential nominee. Obama did not mention Trump by name, but he lambasted the billionaire‚Äôs policy proposals, particularly his promise to dismantle most of the U.S. Dodd-Frank financial regulations. ‚ÄúHow it is that somebody would propose that we weaken regulations on Wall Street? Have we really forgotten what just happened eight years ago?‚Äù Obama said, sounding exasperated. ‚ÄúThe notion that you would vote for anybody who would now allow them to go back to doing the same stuff that almost broke our economy‚Äôs back makes no sense. I don‚Äôt care whether you are a Republican, or a Democrat or an independent, why would you do that?‚Äù Obama, who leaves office in January, is eager to have a Democrat succeed him to ensure his legacy on the economy, healthcare reform and climate change continues. By going to Elkhart, the president sought to illustrate the success of his policies in the face of Republican opposition. His trip to the city in early 2009 came in the middle of a fight for the U.S. Congress to pass a roughly $800 billion economic stimulus package. Elkhart had an unemployment rate as high as 19.6 percent in 2009, the White House said; it is now around 4 percent.  Indiana‚Äôs Republican Governor Mike Pence said the city had recovered despite Obama‚Äôs policies, not because of them. ‚ÄúI believe the people of Elkhart ... have brought our economy back in spite of the burdens that higher taxes, mandates and increasing regulations from Washington, D.C. have placed on them,‚Äù he wrote in an opinion piece published in ‚ÄúThe Elkhart Truth.‚Äù Obama has not endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her race for the Democratic presidential nomination against Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, but he has made his eagerness to campaign for the winner clear. He name checked Clinton‚Äôs husband, former President Bill Clinton, by noting deficits had fallen under both of their administrations, and he said Republicans had helped the rich by blaming poor people, minorities, feminists, and immigrants for squeezing the economic wellbeing of the middle class. ‚ÄúThe primary story that Republicans have been telling about  the economy is not supported by the facts. It‚Äôs just not,‚Äù Obama said to a largely supportive crowd at a local high school. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 "
Former Los Angeles mayor starts anti-Trump campaign,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said on Wednesday he had formed a political action committee and started raising money to help fight Donald Trump‚Äôs Republican presidential campaign in key states with large Latino immigrant populations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm focusing all my efforts from now to November on stopping Trump,‚Äù Villaraigosa said in a conference call with reporters.  Calling Trump a racist and misogynist, Villaraigosa said his committee, called Building Bridges, Not Walls, would focus on organizing immigrants to oppose the presumptive Republican nominee in California, Arizona, Nevada and Florida in the campaign for the Nov. 8 election. Opened with his own $1,000 contribution, the committee would seek donations to pay for its activities, Villaraigosa said.  Villaraigosa, a Democrat who was Los Angeles mayor from 2005 to 2013 and also served as speaker of the California Assembly, is perhaps the state‚Äôs highest-profile Latino leader. He has said he is considering a run for governor in 2018.  His anti-Trump campaign is among the first efforts to formally turn concern among immigrants about the billionaire‚Äôs campaign into political action. Last week, Democrats in San Diego organized an anti-Trump demonstration that drew about 400 people. Trump has made concern over illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign. He has accused the Mexican government of sending rapists and criminals across the border, pledged to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and called for a temporary halt to Muslim immigration amid fears that radicalized immigrants will commit terrorist acts. Last week in the border city of San Diego, Trump called a judge hearing a case against one of his businesses ‚Äúhostile‚Äù and ‚Äúa hater‚Äù and said he believed the judge was Mexican. ‚ÄúBoth Democrats and Republicans are horrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency,‚Äù Villaraigosa said. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 "
Obama says the Democratic nominee will be clear next week: PBS,"ELKHART, Ind (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he expected the winner of the Democratic presidential nominating race would be clear next week after Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders compete in races in California and New Jersey. ‚ÄúI think that there has been a healthy debate in the Democratic Party, and it‚Äôs almost over,‚Äù Obama said during a town hall-style event broadcast by PBS. People will ‚Äúprobably have a pretty good sense next week,‚Äù of who the nominee will be, Obama said. Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, is the front-runner in the Democratic race. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, lags her in the number of delegates needed to wrap up the nomination. California and New Jersey, which both have large numbers of delegates up for grabs, hold their votes next Tuesday.  Obama has not endorsed either candidate in the Democratic race, though he has made clear his affection and admiration for Clinton, who was his opponent in the 2008 Democratic nominating race.

Starr steps down as Baylor chancellor after sex assault scandal,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Former Baylor University President Kenneth Starr resigned as chancellor of the world‚Äôs largest Baptist university on Wednesday after being implicated in a report for not doing enough to probe sexual assaults by athletes. Starr, who rose to prominence for his exhaustive investigation of sex scandals surrounding then-President Bill Clinton, stepped down as chancellor but will keep his post as a professor in Baylor‚Äôs law school. ‚ÄúWith sorrow, earlier this morning, I announced my resignation effective immediately as chancellor of Baylor University as a matter of conscience,‚Äù Starr said in an exclusive interview on ESPN television‚Äôs ‚ÄúOutside the Lines.‚Äù Starr added he was unaware of what was happening but still accepted responsibility. ‚ÄúWe need to put this horrible situation behind us,‚Äù he said.  One of the victims of sexual assault at Baylor, identified only as ‚ÄúSarah,‚Äù told the show she sent a letter to Starr about being raped. She finds it hard to believe that he did not know about other sexual assaults. Baylor‚Äôs board of regents accepted the resignation, the school said. Last week, the central Texas university in Waco removed Starr as president and fired head football coach Art Briles after an independent report found administrators mishandled sexual abuse cases involving football players. The investigation found actions by Baylor administrators directly discouraged students from reporting sexual assaults. In one case, the actions included retaliating against a complainant for reporting a sexual assault. ‚ÄúWe were horrified by what we learned from the investigation and again express our public acknowledgment and deepest apologies,‚Äù the board said in a statement on Wednesday. In March, a former student at Baylor brought a negligence lawsuit in federal court against the school, claiming it acted callously and indifferently after she was raped by a Baylor football player. In a separate scandal, Baylor football player Sam Ukwuachu was sentenced last year to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a fellow student in 2013. Starr became Baylor‚Äôs president in 2010, promising to promote the school‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat tradition in the Christian world.‚Äù A former appeals court judge, Starr was appointed as a special counsel to investigate Clinton over a real estate investment and other matters. His probe widened to include Clinton‚Äôs sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and led to Clinton‚Äôs impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Republicans could not muster the two-thirds majority in the Senate needed to remove Clinton from office. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 "
Kansas is latest U.S. state to challenge Obama transgender directive,"(Reuters) - Kansas vowed on Wednesday to sue the Obama administration over a directive telling U.S. public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identities. The announcement by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt made the state the 13th to wade into an acrimonious debate about the rights of transgender Americans. It comes a day after a federal appeals court refused to reconsider its ruling that gave a Virginia transgender high-school student access to the bathroom of his gender identity. The court‚Äôs decision ‚Äúmeans our only option is to pursue a more direct challenge to the Obama administration‚Äôs unlawful efforts to unilaterally rewrite Title IX,‚Äù Schmidt, a Republican, said in a statement. President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority. The letter relied on an interpretation of Title IX, which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education initiatives that receive federal financial assistance. The letter did not have the force of law but contained an implicit threat that schools that do not abide by the directive could lose federal aid. Schmidt called the directive an attempt to expand federal power. Also on Wednesday, the Kansas Senate passed by 30-to-8 a resolution opposing the Obama administration‚Äôs guidance on transgender students‚Äô bathroom use that said state and local officials, and not federal officials, should decide school policy and that the directive threatens students‚Äô privacy and safety.  Officials from 11 U.S. states - Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin - sued the Obama administration last week, calling its directive ‚Äúa massive social experiment.‚Äù Mississippi‚Äôs Republican governor said on Thursday he planned to join the lawsuit.  Schmidt said he is reviewing whether Kansas will join the lawsuit by the 11 states, led by Texas, or file a separate, similar lawsuit. North Carolina sued the federal government last month, seeking to protect a state law passed in March that bans people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. But while many states have protested the Obama administration directive, others have acted to protect the rights of transgender individuals. Massachusetts lawmakers on Wednesday were voting on a measure that would make the state the 18th to ban discrimination based on gender identity. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 "
"As Puerto Rico government frays, bondholders might get paid","SAN JUAN (Reuters) - As struggling Puerto Rico enters a bitter election season, discord in the U.S. territory‚Äôs ruling party is reaching new heights, which could benefit bondholders. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has pushed to force hedge funds, mutual funds and other investors to take losses on the $70 billion Puerto Rico owes them because it cannot repay the debt in full. He says the island's staggering poverty and lack of money to ensure basic services constitutes a humanitarian crisis. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5) Garcia Padilla, deeply unpopular with exhausted political capital, has dwindling allies among campaigning lawmakers now distancing themselves from him. They may adopt more creditor-friendly policies to counter his populist ideals, experts say.¬† Puerto Rican residents vote in local primaries this Sunday with some members of Garcia Padilla‚Äôs Popular Democratic Party locked in tight battles, including Rep. Rafael ‚ÄúTatito‚Äù Hernandez, who runs Puerto Rico‚Äôs House finance committee. The island‚Äôs election cycle is unique, with all posts decided on the same day every four years, making political campaigns especially heated. Election day, Nov. 8, is a holiday, and voter turnout averages more than 80 percent. The governor will not seek a second term, and financial markets have never given him much credibility. His administration has yet to publish fiscal 2014‚Äôs audited financial results. That has fed a perception of irresponsible government, and spurred PDP members to try to distance themselves from his administration. The dynamic could play into the hands of creditors. Garcia Padilla set aside about $200 million in the fiscal 2017 budget toward the $800 million payment due on GO debt July 1, but Hernandez has said he will lobby to earmark enough to pay it all. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of lobbying here by bondholders, and one of the big issues is whether to include money to pay that debt in next year‚Äôs budget,‚Äù Sergio Marxuach, a San Juan-based economist, said in an interview. A law signed in April, giving the governor authority to issue moratoriums on debt payments, could be scaled back, said Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who follows Puerto Rico. ‚ÄúOur base case has been that the budget will be used as leverage to amend back parts of the moratorium,‚Äù Hanson said.  While these local fights play out, the U.S. Congress has been debating a bill that would pull Puerto Rico‚Äôs finances under federal oversight and allow the government to restructure its bond debt. The governor, though never wildly popular, has had some success pushing his agenda. But lately the wheels have come off, even though his party has controlled the House and Senate since 2013.¬† Key party leaders, like Hernandez and former Secretary of State David Bernier, the PDP‚Äôs gubernatorial candidate, have openly criticized him. Garcia Padilla‚Äôs own economy minister, Alberto Baco Bague, publicly questioned the legitimacy of the humanitarian crisis, telling local media in May the narrative was a political ‚Äústrategy.‚Äù Baco declined to comment for this story. Last week, in a boon for businesses, the legislature repealed a new round of tax hikes on professional services, the same bill it had approved just last year on the strength of Garcia Padilla‚Äôs message of financial desperation. Adding to the chaos, a group of Puerto Rico creditors sued Garcia Padilla‚Äôs administration over the legality of the debt moratorium, despite having signed an agreement barring lawsuits while sides negotiated a restructuring. The move reflected ever-growing acrimony between the government and its creditors, Hanson said. A spokeswoman for Garcia Padilla‚Äôs office had no immediate comment. Like Baco‚Äôs criticism, much of the internal discord turns on whether there is actually a humanitarian crisis. But while that argument may be losing political steam, it should not be disregarded, Marxuach said. The message has resonated with Democrats in Washington, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Rep. Raul Grijalva, who made separate visits to Puerto Rico in May to stress the dire human circumstances on the island.  ‚ÄúPuerto Rico is at a moment of necessity and crisis,‚Äù Lew said May 9 in San Juan.¬† Marxuach said the crisis is not so much a ticking time bomb, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a slow burn.‚Äù¬† Public pensions covering 330,000 beneficiaries are the worst-funded of any state-level U.S. pension this century, set to run out of cash in three years.  Hospitals face staffing shortfalls as doctors flee to better-paying jobs on the mainland. The island‚Äôs poverty rate is at 45 percent; unemployment is near 12 percent, and higher in rural towns.¬† Puerto Ricans‚Äô ability to emigrate to the mainland is an escape hatch that mitigates the economic stress and political pressure to fix it.¬† But for those without the ability to escape the burdens just grow. ‚ÄúThe debt stays the same,‚Äù said Marxuach, ‚Äúbut the economy grows even less.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 "
NY mayor criticizes Trump's closing public atrium for campaign events,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A showdown between New York City and Donald Trump over one of the most potent symbols of Trump‚Äôs candidacy, the glitzy atrium of Trump Tower, intensified on Wednesday as the mayor‚Äôs office criticized his closing of the tower‚Äôs public space for campaign events. Lined with pink marble and indoor waterfalls and a popular tourist attraction, the atrium has become a favorite event backdrop for Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the U.S. presidency, who frequently boasts to voters of his wealthy lifestyle and his success as a building developer. City officials are now investigating whether Trump‚Äôs using the atrium for private campaign events without permission is in breach of a long-standing agreement between Trump and the city‚Äôs planners. Trump had agreed to maintain it as a public space as a zoning concession when the tower was built.  A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, weighed in on Wednesday to register City Hall‚Äôs displeasure, which may yet force Trump to find an alternative setting for his events for the five months remaining before the November presidential election.  ‚ÄúDespite what he may think, the rules and laws of this city apply to everybody, including Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump should honor his agreement with the city to keep the space open to the public,‚Äù Austin Finan, the spokesman, said in a statement. In order to build his flagship Fifth Avenue skyscraper taller than zoning rules would have otherwise allowed, including the penthouse where Trump lives, Trump agreed to keep the atrium open to the public from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day. The atrium, opened in 1983, is one of scores of ‚Äúprivately owned public spaces‚Äù across the city, an effort to balance the wishes of developers to build taller while preserving pockets of space for New Yorkers in crowded neighborhoods. Since launching his campaign by descending an escalator into the atrium last June, Trump has held at least half a dozen campaign events where Reuters reporters have seen his security staff prevent anyone but a few pre-approved journalists from entering parts or all of the atrium.  City officials, whose investigation was first reported by Reuters on Tuesday, say they have no evidence of Trump seeking or getting permission to close the space for a private event, which is allowed to happen up to four times a year.  Michael Cohen, an executive vice president for the Trump Organization, said on Tuesday he could neither confirm nor deny if there had been a violation of the agreement while his staff tried to locate the paperwork. He did not respond to questions on Wednesday. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 "

Congress probes NY Fed's handling of Bangladesh Bank heist: letter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee has launched a probe into the Federal Reserve Bank of New York‚Äôs handling of the cyber theft of $81 million from one of its accounts held by the central bank of Bangladesh, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The letter, addressed to New York Fed President William Dudley and sent Tuesday from the House of Representatives‚Äô Science Committee, requests ‚Äúall documents and communications‚Äù connected to the February heist, the bank‚Äôs oversight of the global financial network SWIFT and the status of any reviews related to the Fed‚Äôs information technology conducted since the attack occurred. The letter follows similar probes launched last month by Tom Carper, the Senate Homeland Security Committee‚Äôs top Democrat, and Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat. The latest inquiry comes as policymakers, regulators and financial institutions around the world increase scrutiny into the heist and related attacks on banks in Vietnam and Ecuador, in which hackers sent fraudulent transaction messages across the SWIFT. ‚ÄúIn light of the recent cyber attacks on our global financial systems, the Committee believes it is imperative to receive information from the NY Fed about its response, its oversight of SWIFT, the status of the investigation, and any remedial steps taken to address vulnerabilities,‚Äù states the letter, signed by House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican. A New York Fed spokeswoman said it intended to respond to the new request for information. The bank has so far denied responsibility for the Bangladesh Bank intrusion. The letter said it was ‚Äúdeeply troubling‚Äù that cyber security experts believe more attacks will be uncovered as banks review their security systems, and that Bangladesh Bank‚Äôs systems appeared to be the ‚Äúweak link‚Äù in the February attack. SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, last week urged banks to bolster their security, saying it was aware of multiple attacks. Banks around the world rely on SWIFT to issue payment instructions to each other. The committee requested a response from the New York Fed by June 14. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 "
New York probing Trump's closing of Trump Tower atrium for campaign events," (This May 31 story corrects atrium‚Äôs opening times in sixth paragraph: ‚Äúbetween 8 a.m. and 10 p.m.‚Äù instead of ‚Äúbetween 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.‚Äù) By Jonathan Allen NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City is investigating Donald Trump‚Äôs practice of closing down the public atrium in Trump Tower for presidential campaign events that are off limits to the public.   In order to add more floors than zoning rules would otherwise allow, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, agreed to create a two-story public atrium on the ground and lower floors of the building, which opened in 1983 on Manhattan‚Äôs Fifth Avenue. But security staff wearing Trump badges spent several hours shooing away a growing crowd of New Yorkers and tourists from the doors on Tuesday morning after Trump decided to hold a news conference in the atrium to discuss his fundraising for veterans groups. ‚ÄúDepartment of Buildings inspectors will be investigating the allegations that the (public atrium) was closed contrary to the building owner‚Äôs agreement with the city,‚Äù Joe Soldevere, a department spokesman, told Reuters on Tuesday. There are scores of ‚Äúprivately owned public spaces,‚Äù or POPS, throughout New York City, intended as a trade-off between developers who want to build taller and preserving space for the public in the city‚Äôs densest neighborhoods. In the case of Trump Tower, the 6,000-square-foot public atrium, which is lined with pink marble, must be open to the public between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. every day, a fact advertised in large gold letters over the building‚Äôs Fifth Avenue entrance. As with other such spaces, it can be closed up to four times a year for a private event after permission from city officials.  Trump has held several events in the public areas of Trump Tower since launching his campaign in the atrium there last June. Officials at the Department of City Planning, which grants permission to close a POPS for an event, and the Department of Buildings, which investigates violations, said they had no record of Trump ever seeking or being granted permission to shut out the public for a campaign event. The investigation was prompted by media reports of the news conference.  Inspectors will seek evidence that the public was denied access without the city‚Äôs permission, including testimony from anyone turned away. Violations carry a $4,000 fine. Michael Cohen, an executive vice president for the Trump Organization, said his staff was trying to locate the text of the agreement with the city, and could not immediately confirm or deny the suggestion that closing the atrium was a violation. Trump lives in a penthouse in the tower with his family and has his main office there. He previously battled with the city over the space, most recently after he replaced a bench there with a kiosk selling Trump merchandise. A city judge ruled the kiosk violated Trump‚Äôs agreement with the city, and Trump agreed to removed the kiosk in January and pay a $4,000 fine. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 "
Trump says to visit UK to open golf resort on June 24,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would visit Britain for the opening of his Scottish golf resort on June 24, his first trip to the UK since a spat with Prime Minister David Cameron over comments he made about Muslims. Relations between Cameron and Trump, whose visit comes the day after Britain holds a referendum on its membership of the European Union, have been tense since the British leader called his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States dangerous and stupid. Trump‚Äôs idea for a boycott of Muslims, mooted last December, also led to calls from some lawmakers for him to be banned from Britain, with almost 600,000 people signing an online petition to keep him out. While Cameron and his ministers rejected that call, the prime minister did suggest that Trump would unite the nation against him if he visited Britain.  Trump responded by saying he was unlikely to have a good relationship with Cameron, although both men have since tempered their language after Trump effectively became the presumptive Republican Party nominee. Cameron has said he would be happy to meet him, although no date had been fixed, and Trump said they could have a good relationship after all. A spokesman for Cameron said there were no firm plans for a meeting, although it was a long-standing practice for a prime minister to meet presidential nominees if they visited Britain. Trump‚Äôs visit will coincide with the result of Britain‚Äôs EU referendum, and while Cameron is leading the campaign for Britain to stay in the bloc, Trump has said he thinks Britons would be better off outside. In a statement, Trump made no mention of any potential Cameron meeting, saying only that his visit to Britain was for the official opening of his golf resort at Turnberry following a 200 million pound ($290 million) refurbishment. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said the date of the opening had been planned long in advance and that it was just a coincidence it came the day after the EU vote. The date would not be changed, she added. The golf course has itself pitted Trump against British politicians after Scotland‚Äôs devolved government approved plans for an offshore wind farm nearby which led Trump to denounce Scottish ministers as ‚Äúfoolish, small minded and parochial‚Äù.

Venezuela's Maduro rooting for 'revolutionary friend' Sanders in U.S. campaign,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela‚Äôs embattled president, Nicolas Maduro, said on Tuesday night he supported Bernie Sanders in the U.S. presidential race, adding that the candidate, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, would win if the vote were ‚Äúfree.‚Äù  Maduro, a socialist who sees himself as the political heir to his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, has long railed against the United States, blaming it for Venezuela‚Äôs economic crisis and accusing Washington of attempting to topple him. ‚ÄúBernie Sanders, our revolutionary friend, ought to win in the United States,‚Äù Maduro said during an hours-long televised broadcast.  ‚ÄúIf the elections were free ...

In an email to supporters in September, Sanders called Chavez a ‚Äúdead communist dictator.‚Äù Venezuela is reeling from a brutal economic crisis that has seen food and medicine running short and spiraling inflation destroying incomes.  The United States and Venezuela have had troubled relations since Chavez became president in 1999, and the countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010.

Illinois ends spring session without a FY 2017 budget,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (Reuters) - The Democrat-controlled Illinois Legislature ended its spring session late Tuesday, failing to produce a full fiscal 2017 budget to tackle financial woes or even a plan to fund schools. Hours before the session ended Republican Governor Bruce Rauner chastised Democrats for their ‚Äústunning failure‚Äù on the budget front. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre like a banana republic. We can‚Äôt manage our money,‚Äù he said at a news conference. A House-passed budget that Rauner vowed to veto for being more than $7 billion short on revenue failed badly in a Senate vote. Illinois has limped through fiscal 2016 as the only U.S. state without a complete budget, operating under court-ordered spending, and continuing and stopgap appropriations.  The governor last year vetoed all but a school funding bill in the Democrats‚Äô budget for the fiscal year that ends June 30.  The impasse between Rauner and Democrats showed no sign of easing and could leave the nation‚Äôs fifth-largest state runningon a similar autopilot as the new fiscal year begins July 1. Vendors, social services providers, state universities, community colleges and others that have received partial or no funding over the last year are reaching breaking point. That in turn could bring widespread operational problems if the state is unable to obtain food, utilities, fuel and other essentials. ‚ÄúReal people are going to suffer. Real people are going to die,‚Äù warned Democratic State Representative Jack Franks. The legislature also failed to approve a stand-alone K-12 education budget. A $15.7-billion bill to ensure schools open in the fall passed the Senate but was soundly defeated in the House.  Its demise leaves the financially struggling Chicago Public Schools (CPS) without an additional $475 million in funding in part to help pay for rising contributions to teacher pensions. CPS officials have warned of ‚Äúdraconian‚Äù spending cuts to deal with a $1 billion budget deficit. Democratic leaders on Tuesday refused to immediately take up Rauner‚Äôs short-term budget plan, shunting it off to a bipartisan working group. Future budget deliberations will be complicated by the fact that a tougher, three-fifths voting majority to pass a bill kicks in on Wednesday.  House Speaker Michael Madigan has made clear his chamber will meet every week during June to work on a budget.  The inability to send Rauner a spending plan exposed an unusual level of dysfunction within the Democratic Party, whose super majorities in both legislative chambers were racked by infighting over how best to confront the 11-month impasse with the governor. The Senate‚Äôs refusal to adopt a budget plan bearing the clear imprint of Madigan, the state party chairman, represented a stinging rebuke to the longest-serving statehouse speaker in America and a setback Rauner allies called a ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù for Democrats. Within the 39-member Senate Democratic majority, some senators complained they were unable to have input in the House-passed plan, which arrived last week as a take-it-or-leave it proposition, one of Madigan‚Äôs legislative hallmarks over the years in his dealings with Illinois‚Äô upper legislative chamber. ‚ÄúThere was a lot of resentment over the way it was passed,‚Äù said Senate President John Cullerton. Without a budget, Illinois, which already has the lowest bond ratings among the 50 states, risks harming its credit standing further. Credit rating agencies have warned of downgrades if the state fails to tackle its $111-billion unfunded pension liability and huge structural budget deficit. The governor‚Äôs budget office has hired consultants to help disengage from interest rate swap pacts that could cost the state more than $100 million if its ratings fall below specified levels.

"Combative Trump says he raised $5.6 million for vets, bashes media","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday detailed $5.6 million in contributions he raised for military veterans, and staged a fiery news conference where he attacked reporters for questioning him for months about the money.                  Appearing at Trump Tower in Manhattan, the billionaire accused the media of failing to give him credit for raising the funds at an event in January in Iowa. His tirade, in which he called one reporter ‚Äúa sleaze‚Äù and sarcastically described another as a ‚Äúreal beauty,‚Äù overshadowed what otherwise should have been an upbeat event for the presumptive Republican nominee. ‚ÄúThe press should be ashamed of themselves,‚Äù he told reporters gathered before him. ‚ÄúYou make me look very bad. I‚Äôve never received such bad publicity for doing a good job.‚Äù While Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media, questions about the donations to veterans touched a raw nerve with him as he tries to build a conservative base ahead of the Nov. 8 general election.     Reporters have been persistently asking whether Trump in fact raised all the money he said he had in January and why it took so long to hand donations over to veterans groups. A number of veterans groups listed by Trump on Tuesday as recipients confirmed they had received the donation as listed, ranging from $25,000 to, in one case, $1.1 million, which went to the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation. Some of the donations arrived in February or March, some as recently as last week around the time a critical article appeared in The Washington Post. The money arrived in the form of a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation. ‚ÄúWe received a $75,000 gift early last week from the Trump Foundation, it was not restricted or earmarked in any way,‚Äù said Katherine Fritz, director of development at America‚Äôs Vetdogs. Trump‚Äôs criticism of the media dashed the hopes of some Republican leaders who want him to tone down his rhetoric and become more magnanimous now that he has sealed the Republican presidential nomination. The Washington Post said Trump only handed over a personal donation of $1 million last week - four months after announcing it - once the newspaper started asking about the money. Trump said the news coverage of his veterans group donations had been close to libelous. Asked whether he would maintain an adversarial stance with reporters if elected president, Trump said: ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs going to be like this.‚Äù A reporter told Trump he seemed resistant to the kind of scrutiny that comes with the office of U.S. president. But Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, said the news media should stop fretting about how Trump treats them. ‚ÄúMy advice to the press: Stop interviewing yourselves about Trump‚Äôs attack on the press. Don‚Äôt worry about it. Just do your jobs and be fair,‚Äù he said. The contretemps took place on the same day documents were disclosed from a lawsuit involving Trump University, a now-defunct education program that ran a real estate training program. Trump has attacked the presiding judge as hostile to him.  The university documents showed Trump University created a special class to teach students how to cash in on U.S. mortgage foreclosures when the United States was struggling with an entrenched housing crisis in 2009. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton sought to take advantage of Trump‚Äôs discomfort over the media scrutiny he has faced. She told CNN that Trump‚Äôs tendency to attack his critics ‚Äúis a recipe for gridlock in Washington.‚Äù Clinton defended her own policy toward dealing with the news media, saying she has conducted 300 interviews this year alone. Unlike Trump, she rarely holds news conferences. Her last one was last December. Clinton leads Trump by 11 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. According to the May 27-31 survey of likely voters, 46 percent support the former U.S. secretary of state while 35 percent back Trump.   California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Clinton for the Democratic nomination, saying it was the only way to ‚Äústop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump.‚Äù            At his news conference, Trump also bristled at the possibility that Republicans opposed to him might run a third-party candidate as an alternative to Trump or the expected Democratic nominee Clinton. He said a leader of that effort, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard magazine, ‚Äúlooks like such a fool.‚Äù ‚ÄúLet me tell you these people are losers,‚Äù said Trump, adding that a third-party candidacy would guarantee Clinton wins the White House and deny Republicans the chance to put conservatives on the Supreme Court. ‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre going to do is lose the election for the Republicans and therefore you lose the Supreme Court,‚Äù he said. Trump read out a list of veterans‚Äô organizations that had received money from the January event, which he attended instead of participating in a Fox News-sponsored candidates‚Äô debate. He said the money was benefiting 41 groups and that the total cash raised could climb as more comes in.  He turned the microphone over briefly to Al Baldasaro, a Trump supporter and a veteran from New Hampshire who also skewered the news media, saying reporters should ‚Äúget your head out of your butt, focus on the real issues.‚Äù             ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 "

Trump University told students how to 'cash in' on housing crash,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs eponymous business seminar program created a class to teach students how to cash in on U.S. mortgage foreclosures during the housing crisis. Trump University promised in 2009 that its ‚ÄúFast Track to Foreclosure Investing‚Äù would teach students how to take advantage of the crisis, according to university documents unsealed last week in a lawsuit against the now-defunct program. ¬†¬†¬† The release will likely stoke criticism from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who last week accused her likely rival in the Nov. 8 presidential election of having cheered on the 2008 housing crash as an investment opportunity. A spokeswoman for Trump‚Äôs campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although Trump reacted to Clinton‚Äôs criticism last week, saying: ‚ÄúWhat am I going to do? I‚Äôm in business.‚Äù A Trump University advertisement released in the case said one of its free investor workshops would explain how to ‚ÄúCash in on one of the greatest property liquidations in history!‚Äù Trump University instructors were to teach students how to ‚Äúcapitalize without harm‚Äù and find ways for ‚Äúsellers to move on without shame,‚Äù according to a December 2008 summary of the seminar. An earlier 2007 memo to enrollment counselors stated that about 1.5 million U.S. homeowners would face foreclosure that year and laid out how they should advise students to seize the ‚Äútremendous opportunity‚Äù to purchase properties at ‚Äúmajor discounts‚Äù in ‚Äúhot markets‚Äù such as Arizona, Florida and Texas. The roughly 400 pages of documents included ‚Äúplaybooks‚Äù on how to recruit students, directions for how instructors should deal with the media and other details about Trump‚Äôs seminar program. They were unsealed on Friday by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom Trump called ‚Äúhostile‚Äù and ‚Äúa hater,‚Äù adding he believed the judge was Mexican. New York‚Äôs attorney general slammed Trump on Tuesday for his comment on the judge‚Äôs ethnicity. Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law. Clinton‚Äôs attack on Trump last week was prompted by recently released audio that Trump recorded in 2006 for Trump University.

NY attorney general slams Trump's comment on judge's ethnicity,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York‚Äôs attorney general, who has filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump‚Äôs education venture, Trump University, slammed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday for his attack on a U.S. district judge‚Äôs ethnicity. Trump, a New York billionaire businessman, is fighting a trio of lawsuits that accuse his education program of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about his real-estate investment strategies. ‚ÄúThis was a fraud from top to bottom. He‚Äôs using every trick he can to delay the release of documents, to delay the trials, attacking the judge for his ethnicity, attacking me and accusing me of conspiring with the president of the United States,‚Äù New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, told CNN. Days after Judge Gonzalo Curiel ordered some documents in one case involving the school to be unsealed, Trump called Curiel ‚Äúhostile‚Äù and ‚Äúa hater‚Äù and said he believed the judge was Mexican. Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law. Schneiderman, re-elected as attorney general in 2014, dismissed a question about Trump‚Äôs allegation that Curiel‚Äôs ruling was politically motivated, saying that in three individual cases against the university, ‚Äúevery judge has said these are valid fraud claims.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking it to New York‚Äôs highest court for one more round of appeals, but no judge has dismissed this,‚Äù Schneiderman said. Asked about Trump‚Äôs efforts to downplay the case,  Schneiderman called it ‚Äúhugely important‚Äù for the way it cast Trump as ‚Äúsomeone who is absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people.‚Äù He blasted some of the university‚Äôs specific tactics, including the way instructors would persuade students to ask their credit card companies for an increased credit limit as a step toward being successful in real estate, and then persuade them to use it to buy more Trump seminars. ‚ÄúIt was shameless, it was heartless, it‚Äôs important information to get out there,‚Äù Schneiderman said.

Massachusetts governor would sign transgender rights bill,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said on Tuesday he is ready to sign a transgender rights bill if it passes in its current form in the state House of Representatives amid an acrimonious debate across the United States about the issue. Baker, a socially liberal Republican, had come under fire this year for refusing to say whether he would approve the bill, which would ban discrimination against transgender people in public restrooms and other public buildings. It passed the state Senate last month. ‚ÄúNo one should be discriminated against in Massachusetts because of their gender identity,‚Äù Baker said in a statement. ‚ÄúI would sign the House version in its current form should it reach my desk.‚Äù The Massachusetts House is due to vote on the measure on Wednesday. It is expected to pass by a wide margin in the Democratic-controlled chamber. The House version of the bill differs from the version passed by the Senate in that it directs the state attorney general to issue guidelines to law enforcement on how to handle people who claim transgender rights ‚Äúfor an improper purpose.‚Äù That language is a nod to one of the main concerns of opponents of people using bathrooms or locker rooms that do not correspond with their birth gender - that sexual predators will claim transgender status to access potential victims. The measure would make liberal-leaning Massachusetts the 18th U.S. state to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. The issue of transgender rights has become the latest front in America‚Äôs culture wars. Some supporters of the Massachusetts measure described it as a rebuke to a law put in place in March in North Carolina prohibiting people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to the sex on their birth certificates.

Justice Department asks for hold on court sanctions in immigration case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday filed an emergency motion to stop sanctions imposed by a federal judge in Texas that  included mandated ethics classes for federal prosecutors, as part of ongoing litigation over immigration policy. The sanctions were ordered on May 19 by District Judge Andrew Hanen, who ruled in February 2015 that President Barack Obama‚Äôs executive actions on immigration were outside the bounds of the president‚Äôs authority. Hanen also ordered the Department of Homeland Security to prepare a state-by-state review of immigrants who were given three years of safeguards from deportation under Obama‚Äôs previous immigration action instead of two.  The case has been brought before the U.S. Supreme Court.  The Justice Department asked Hanen to put a hold on the sanctions while it seeks a review from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department will ask the Fifth Circuit for an appeal of the decision, a mandamus order or both to block the sanction order.  In the court filing, in Houston, the Justice Department said it ‚Äútakes with utmost seriousness the public trust committed to it to represent the interests of the American people in the courts of the United States, and insists that its attorneys adhere to the high standards of ethical conduct and professionalism required to carry out that critical mission.‚Äù     ‚ÄúThe court‚Äôs order to turn over immigration records would undermine trust in the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs ability to maintain the confidentiality of personal information, which is essential to its mission,‚Äù said Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for the Justice Department, in connection with the review ordered by Hanen.

Supreme Court rejects union appeal over Trump casino bankruptcy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a union‚Äôs appeal of a lower court‚Äôs ruling that allowed Atlantic City‚Äôs Trump Taj Mahal casino, founded by Donald Trump but now owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, to break its contract with union workers to secure a bankruptcy rescue deal. The high court‚Äôs decision not to hear the appeal by Unite Here Local 54 leaves in place a January decision by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that cleared the way for the casino to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The struggling casino has since emerged from bankruptcy and is now owned by Icahn Enterprises LP. It was the New Jersey city‚Äôs largest casino when Trump opened it in 1990 but it later fell on hard times along with other Atlantic City casinos. Trump, the billionaire real estate developer and presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee, founded the casino and it bears his name, but he has said he no longer has a stake in it. In 2014, the casino‚Äôs owner, Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc, filed for bankruptcy. Last year, it convinced a U.S. bankruptcy judge that it had to impose a new lower-cost contract on unionized workers in order to secure Icahn‚Äôs rescue deal. The union appealed, arguing that because the collective bargaining agreement expired before the bankruptcy, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction. The appeals court sided with Trump Entertainment, saying a bankruptcy judge must be free to evaluate a labor contract that may determine the fate of a business. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 "
Supreme Court rejects constitutional challenge to death penalty,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to hear an appeal asserting that the death penalty violates the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs ban on cruel and unusual punishment filed by a Louisiana man convicted of fatally shooting his pregnant former girlfriend. Two of the eight justices, liberals Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said they would have accepted the case, repeating concerns about the death penalty‚Äôs constitutionality they raised in a different case last year. The justices, who have sharply disagreed among themselves over capital punishment, declined to consider the appeal brought by Lamondre Tucker, who was sentenced to death for the 2008 murder of 18-year-old Tavia Sills in Shreveport. Sills, nearly five months pregnant, was shot three times and her body was dumped in a pond. Tucker, who is black, had argued in part that black males had an increased likelihood of being convicted of murder and sentenced to death in Louisiana‚Äôs Caddo Parish due to endemic racism. At the time of Tucker‚Äôs conviction, a Confederate flag, symbol of the pro-slavery Southern states that lost the U.S. Civil War that ended in 1865, flew outside the county courthouse, his lawyers said in court filings. Breyer wrote that Tucker ‚Äúmay well have received the death penalty not because of the comparative egregiousness of his crime, but because of an arbitrary feature of his case, namely geography.‚Äù ‚ÄúOne could reasonably believe that if Tucker had committed the same crime just across the Red River in, say, Bossier Parish, he would not now be on death row,‚Äù Breyer said. Breyer‚Äôs comments echoed similar remarks he made in June 2015 when the court upheld Oklahoma‚Äôs lethal injection procedures.  The shorthanded court has steered clear of taking major cases since the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but even at full strength may not have accepted this one. There is no indication the court is any closer to taking a case that would challenge the death penalty directly, with the court‚Äôs two other liberals, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, not joining Breyer‚Äôs opinion. Four votes are needed for the justices to hear a case.  The pregnant Sills had told Tucker she believed he was the father. Later testing showed Tucker, 18 at the time of the murder, was not the father. The fetus did not survive. The Supreme Court left in place a September 2015 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that rejected Tucker‚Äôs legal arguments and upheld his conviction and death sentence. In the United States, 31 states have the death penalty and 19 do not. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 "
Pressure rises on Marco Rubio to run for Senate re-election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday joined a chorus of Republican stalwarts publicly urging Marco Rubio to run for a second Senate term in Florida, as the party faces an uphill fight to maintain its control of the Senate. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything to encourage him to run,‚Äù McConnell said during an interview on MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorning Joe‚Äù program. Some political strategists and Senate Republican aides see a potentially weak field of Republican candidates for the Florida Senate seat and think Rubio could help Republicans hold their Senate majority if he entered the race. He has until June 24 to decide if he wants to run in the Aug. 30 Republican primary. Josh Holmes, a former McConnell chief of staff, said in a telephone interview that unlike many of the current Republican candidates for the seat, Rubio ‚Äústill enjoys pretty high favorability and very high name ID ratings in Florida and the ability to raise a lot of money.‚Äù Republicans now hold 54 of the chamber‚Äôs 100 seats. There are 44 Democrats and two independents who align themselves with the Democrats.

Last week, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said in a statement that he had ‚Äústrongly encouraged‚Äù Rubio to enter the race. Rubio, a freshman senator elected in 2010, decided to retire from the Senate and instead seek the U.S. presidency. But his effort came to an end in March after he was soundly defeated in the Florida Republican primary by Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election. In a CNN ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù interview that aired on Sunday, Rubio was asked he if would ever seek public office in the future. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a safe assumption,‚Äù he said, without elaborating.

Supreme Court to hear State Farm case over Hurricane Katrina fraud claim,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear an appeal by State Farm contesting a jury finding that the insurance company defrauded the federal government when assessing damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 along the Gulf of Mexico coast. The court will review a 2015 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the verdict in a suit brought under the federal False Claims Act, which lets people sue over allegations that the government has been defrauded. The court will consider a lawsuit brought by sisters Cori and Kerri Rigsby, former claims adjusters who worked with State Farm after the hurricane. People win a portion of the damages if such a False Claims Act suit is successful. The jury found that the U.S. government had been defrauded of $250,000 over a house that had sustained Katrina-related damage in Biloxi, Mississippi. The Rigsbys said the damage was caused by wind, which would be covered by the owners‚Äô policy with State Farm. But State Farm concluded that the damage was flood-related, which was covered by the federal government‚Äôs flood insurance program. The court said State Farm would have to pay $758,000 in damages. The Rigsbys were awarded $227,000 under the False Claims Act. State Farm argued in part that the lawsuit should have been thrown out because the Rigsbys‚Äô former lawyer, Dickie Scruggs, had distributed information about the lawsuit to members of the media. False Claims Act lawsuits are required to be filed under seal and remain private for 60 days. In 2008, Scruggs was convicted of conspiring to bribe a judge in a different case. He was sentenced to five years in prison. The court will hear oral arguments and issue a ruling in the case during its next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2017.

"California governor endorses Clinton, calls Trump dangerous","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, saying it was the only way to keep Republican Donald Trump out of the White House. ‚ÄúI have decided to cast my vote for Hillary Clinton because I believe this is the only path forward to win the presidency and stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump,‚Äù Brown said in a letter to California Democrats and independents posted online. Brown, a popular Democrat who has steered the nation‚Äôs most populous state on a centrist path, praised Clinton‚Äôs rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but noted that she had won about 3 million more votes and hundreds more delegates. ‚ÄúIn other words, Clinton‚Äôs lead is insurmountable and Democrats have shown ‚Äì by millions of votes ‚Äì that they want her as their nominee.‚Äù California is the biggest prize of the six states that hold presidential nominating contests on June 7, with 475 delegates.

State lawmakers override bill veto to ease Chicago pension payments,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago will be able to spread out state-mandated higher payments to its police and fire pensions after the Illinois Legislature on Monday overrode the governor‚Äôs veto of a bill that became entangled in a political impasse. The Senate voted 39-19 and the House voted 72-43 to undo Republican Governor Bruce Rauner‚Äôs veto on Friday that the city claimed would lead to a $300 million property tax hike. The bill gives Chicago short-term budget relief but will add to the city‚Äôs big pension funding gap.  The override bolsters Democrats, who control the legislature, as they battle with Rauner over state assistance for Chicago and its public school system, which is seeking state money for its teachers‚Äô pensions. The political impasse had left Illinois without a complete budget 11 months into fiscal 2016. Rauner called the bill ‚Äúterrible policy,‚Äù while Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel accused him of using the city as a political pawn. Rauner‚Äôs spokeswoman Catherine Kelly released a statement reiterating the governor‚Äôs contention that the measure would end up costing Chicago taxpayers $18.6 billion over time. The measure alters a 2010 state law that boosted Chicago‚Äôs payments to its public safety workers‚Äô pensions in order to reach a 90 percent funded level by 2040. Under that law, Chicago‚Äôs contribution will jump to nearly $834 million this year from $290.4 million in 2015, according to city figures. The new law reduces the payment to $619 million and allows for smaller increases through 2020 than under the 2010 law. It also gives the police and fire funds until 2055 to become 90 percent funded. The police system is 26 percent funded and the fire system 23 percent funded. Chicago‚Äôs fiscal 2016 budget assumed the bill‚Äôs enactment by lowering the city‚Äôs contribution to police and fire pensions by about $220 million. The city council also approved a $543 million phased-in property tax to exclusively cover higher contributions to the two retirement systems. House Speaker Michael Madigan was clearly delighted as he addressed reporters after budget talks with Rauner. ‚ÄúI think it was interesting the governor had nothing to say about the override. I was raised not to cause embarrassment for people so I didn‚Äôt raise it,‚Äù Madigan said. The city must still deal with underfunding problems for its municipal and laborers‚Äô retirement systems after the Illinois Supreme Court in March tossed out a 2014 law that cut benefits and increased contributions to keep the pension funds from insolvency.

As a midnight Tuesday deadline to pass legislation approaches, Rauner and his Democratic rivals who control the state legislature reported no headway toward ending the 11-month long dispute that has left Illinois as the only state without a full operating budget for the current fiscal year. The second-year governor says the budget is $7 billion short on revenues. He has insisted that the budget should be tied to a series of labor-weakening, business-friendly changes that Democrats argue will harm the state‚Äôs working class. In recent weeks, legislative working groups convened by Rauner have tried to bridge differences between the governor and top Democrats. Rauner and the Democratic legislative leaders met for less than a half hour on Monday with House Speaker Michael Madigan declaring plans to keep his legislative chamber in session during June, when a tougher three-fifths majority vote is required to pass a budget. ‚ÄúMy view is that if there‚Äôs no agreement (Tuesday) night, I would ask the governor to keep his working groups functioning on a regular schedule because the House is going to be in continuous session,‚Äù Madigan told reporters after the meeting. Senate President John Cullerton signaled his chamber could vote on a budget bill passed by the House last week, or on an alternative plan he declined to outline. He also said he was trying to round up votes for the House budget bill. ‚Äú[Tuesday] would be a good day to call it,‚Äù Cullerton said. Republican legislative leaders slammed Democrats for their refusal to accept pieces of Rauner‚Äôs non-budgetary agenda or offer revenue sources to pay for their spending plan. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just forcing a tax increase. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing,‚Äù said Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno, adding that Democrats plan a post-November election tax hike vote. Contained within the Democratic spending package is a $760 million increase in funding for Illinois‚Äô public-school system for the fiscal year that begins July 1. A complete Rauner veto of the package would mean schools would be left without adequate state funding in August when schools are set to open for the fall, a gambit Cullerton predicted the governor could not risk.

Judge criticized by Trump unseals documents in Trump University case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge, called a ‚Äúhater‚Äù by Donald Trump for his handling of a lawsuit related to the businessman‚Äôs Trump University real estate school, has unsealed documents related to the case. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, is fighting a lawsuit that accuses his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaire‚Äôs real estate investment strategies. In an order signed on Friday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said that materials, including Trump University procedures on dealing with students and the media, should be unsealed.  He noted they had already been published by the media organization Politico and that a magistrate judge described them previously as ‚Äúroutine‚Äù and ‚Äúcommonplace.‚Äù At a rally in San Diego on Friday, Trump criticized Curiel for his handling of the Trump University case. ‚ÄúI have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He‚Äôs a hater,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama,‚Äù Trump said, adding he believed Curiel was Mexican. Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law. Legal scholars said Trump could face consequences for slamming the judge, although many speculated that Curiel was unlikely to sanction him formally.  ‚ÄúMr. Trump‚Äôs conduct could be subject to sanction for indirect criminal contempt of court,‚Äù said Charles Geyh, a legal ethics expert at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law. ‚ÄúHe has impugned the honesty of the judge in a pending case, and has done so in the context of a political rally that seems calculated to intimidate by inciting anger among his supporters,‚Äù he said. Arthur Hellman, an expert on federal courts and judicial ethics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, said the judge was in a difficult position. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt respond directly. He‚Äôs not supposed to talk out of court about proceedings before him. Judges have gotten into trouble defending themselves from attacks. The judge‚Äôs hands are really tied,‚Äù he said. Trump has drawn criticism for his comments about immigrants from Mexico, some of whom he has said were criminals and rapists.  He has proposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration and requiring Mexico to pay for it. Hispanics are a critical voting bloc in U.S. presidential elections. Last week, Trump knocked one of the highest-profile Hispanic women in the Republican Party, criticizing New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez for her handling of the state‚Äôs economy.  Her office said his criticisms were not substantive. Martinez has been touted as a potential vice presidential pick for a Republican ticket. ",politicsNews,"May 29, 2016 "
"Illinois governor blasts House budget, Chicago mayor","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (Reuters) - Just days before the end of the Illinois legislature‚Äôs spring session, the governor said on Sunday he would veto a House-passed budget, which includes school funding, and fired back at an angry Chicago mayor. Lawmakers face a midnight Tuesday deadline to pass a fiscal 2017 budget and adopt a 2016 spending plan that has remained elusive for the past 11 months, leaving Illinois as the only state without a complete budget for the fiscal year ending June 30.  The impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature showed strong signs of extending into fiscal 2017, with Bruce Rauner pushing for pro-business and anti-union reforms and Democrats in the House of Representatives last week passing a spending plan short about $7 billion in revenue.  Adding fuel to the fire was Rauner‚Äôs veto on Friday of a bill allowing Chicago to spread out payments to its public safety workers‚Äô retirement systems as the city struggles with a structural budget deficit and other pension woes. Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Sunday chastised the governor‚Äôs ‚Äúcallous decision,‚Äù saying it would lead to a $300 million city property tax hike at the same time Rauner wants local property taxes capped. Rauner, who needled Emanuel for not coming to the capital, Springfield, to address the city‚Äôs pension-driven financial woes, called the bill ‚Äúterrible policy,‚Äù saying it would cost Chicago taxpayers $18.6 billion more over the next 30 years by not fully funding pensions.  ‚ÄúWhere is the mayor? He‚Äôs not here, He‚Äôs not asking for real reforms,‚Äù Rauner told reporters outside his office. He also confirmed previous statements from his staff that he would veto the House-passed budget if it was approved by the Senate. He urged lawmakers not to hold schools ‚Äúhostage,‚Äù by sending him a clean bill to fund K-12 public schools. He also asked Democrats to break from longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan. ‚ÄúThe speaker is perfectly fine having deficit spending and borrowing. He‚Äôs perfectly fine crushing the economy, crushing our taxpayers. He‚Äôs been fine with it, and we need his members to say: ‚ÄòNo, Mr. Speaker, no more,‚Äô‚Äù Rauner said. Madigan said his members were prepared to be in continuous session through the summer, blaming Rauner for injecting non-budget demands into the process. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be here (Monday), Tuesday and through the remainder of the summer,‚Äù he said. Passing a budget beyond Tuesday‚Äôs deadline will require tougher-to-get three-fifth majority votes in each chamber. ",politicsNews,"May 29, 2016 "
"Against a backdrop of motorcycles, Trump pledges to help veterans","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a move to bolster support among veterans, Republican Donald Trump joined a leather-jacket-wearing, motorcycle-riding crowd in Washington on Sunday to honor fighters who served in foreign wars and advocate for those still missing in action. Riders from across the country converged on the National Mall near the Lincoln Memorial for the annual ‚ÄúRolling Thunder‚Äù rally and to listen to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who hopes to be commander in chief next year. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to rebuild our military and we‚Äôre going to take care of our veterans,‚Äù Trump told the crowd of thousands, many of whom wore leather vests, veterans‚Äô hats and biker insignia. Trump, the billionaire businessman who has promised to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico if he becomes president, said illegal immigrants in many cases got better care in the United States than military veterans. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to allow that to happen any longer,‚Äù he said. Trump, 69, who did not serve in the military, upset veterans last year when he said Senator John McCain of Arizona was not a war hero.  McCain, a Navy fighter pilot who went on to become the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was imprisoned and tortured after being shot down during the Vietnam War. Trump made no mention of McCain during his remarks on Sunday, and the crowd cheered him enthusiastically, with some waving signs including ‚ÄúBikers for Trump‚Äù and ‚ÄúMake America Great Again.‚Äù Supporters cheered when Trump mentioned veterans and booed at the mention of Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if he can fix (veterans‚Äô issues), but he‚Äôs the only one I think will try,‚Äù said Leonard Westberry, 68, of Richmond, Virginia, a U.S. Army veteran who served in Vietnam in 1967. Westberry said he planned to support Trump in the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs awesome that Trump is here. ... That‚Äôs a good thing,‚Äù said Ralph Giannola, 65, who said he had not decided whether to support Trump in November. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to see any rioting. I mean, protests are OK. I don‚Äôt want to see anybody get hurt,‚Äù he said. There were no protest interruptions during Trump‚Äôs nearly 20-minute address on Sunday, a rarity for similar events. ‚ÄúI know one thing, you‚Äôre going to all behave yourselves, right?‚Äù Trump said to positive affirmations from the crowd. ‚ÄúAnd I know another thing - there won‚Äôt be any paid agitators in this group,‚Äù he added to cheers.

"Rubio warms to Trump, but won't be his vice president","WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Sunday ruled out becoming Donald Trump‚Äôs vice presidential running mate, but said he‚Äôd be ‚Äúhonored‚Äù to play some kind of a role in helping him win the White House. Rubio, who clashed bitterly with Trump in the brutal race for the Republican nomination, said his policy differences with the real estate mogul were too great for Rubio to join the ticket. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be the right choice for him,‚Äù Rubio said in an extensive interview with CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù program. ‚ÄúDonald deserves to have a vice president - he‚Äôs earned the nomination - and he deserves to have a running mate that more fully embraces some of the things he stands for.‚Äù Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, ended his White House bid in March after an embarrassing loss in his home state. Trump, who has practically ensured he will emerge as the nominee from the Republican convention in July, derided Rubio as a lightweight and dubbed him ‚ÄúLittle Marco.‚Äù  Rubio called the real estate mogul a con artist and quipped about his small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood. Rubio and Trump differed sharply on policy issues, with Trump eschewing the interventionist approach favored by Rubio and Rubio criticizing Trump‚Äôs call for temporarily banning the entry of Muslims into the United States. Ahead of the July 18-21 Republican convention, Trump has sought to unify the party behind him and gain the backing of other prominent party figures. Rubio said he expected to attend the convention and did not rule out a speaking role. He said he wanted to be helpful to Trump‚Äôs presidential run because he wants to see likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton defeated in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want Hillary Clinton to be president. If there‚Äôs something I can do to help that from happening and it‚Äôs helpful to the cause I‚Äôd most certainly be honored to be considered for that,‚Äù Rubio said. In another olive branch to Trump, Rubio said he regretted making the ‚Äúsmall hands‚Äù remark about his former foe. ‚ÄúI actually told Donald at one of the debates. I forget which one - I apologized to him for that,‚Äù Rubio said. ‚ÄúI said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry that I said that.‚Äô It‚Äôs not who I am. And I shouldn‚Äôt have done it.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 29, 2016 "
"Bashing Trump not enough for Democrats to win Latino vote, advocates warn","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Latino groups have criticized the Democratic Party for relying too heavily on Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs inflammatory comments on illegal immigration to drive Hispanic voters to the polls, calling instead for the party to do more to address Latino concerns, according to meeting notes seen by Reuters. ‚Äú(W)e cannot rely on Trump as that will set us up for failure,‚Äù according to notes summarizing a meeting on May 2 between Democratic Party officials and representatives of several Hispanic advocacy groups. ‚ÄúOur values‚Ä¶ need to be uplifted,‚Äù they continued. Hispanics make up around 17 percent of the U.S. population, making them a critical voter group in what is expected to be a tight race between Trump and the Democratic nominee.  Democratic operatives have called Trump an ideal spur for getting out the Latino vote because of his hard-line approach to illegal immigration, with some canvassers even using his picture to help encourage Hispanics to register..  The New York billionaire and now presumptive Republican nominee made waves early in his campaign by saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers over the border. He has vowed to make Mexico pay for building a wall to block them and promised to round up and deport the millions of undocumented immigrants now in the United States. By contrast, Democratic contenders for the White House, front-runner Hillary Clinton and rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have both promised to provide undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. The have also promised to nominate Latinos to key posts in their prospective administrations. At least two Hispanics are also considered candidates to be the running mate to the eventual Democratic presidential nominee: Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.   ‚ÄúWhile Latinos appear to be a solid part of the Democratic base right now, that can certainly change,‚Äù said Brent Wilkes, the treasurer for the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda and the national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, who was present at the meeting.  In the last election in 2012, Latinos constituted 10 percent of the electorate and voted for President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney by 71 percent to 27 percent, according to an analysis of exit polls by the Pew Hispanic Center. Many Latino advocates also stressed to the Democratic Party that, as members of nonpartisan organizations, their concerns are in addressing issues within their communities, such as education and the economy, rather than backing any one party or candidate. The Democratic delegation at the meeting, which according to the notes included the new Hispanic outreach director, Bridgette Gomez, assured the advocates their Latino outreach strategy was not merely Trump-focused, one participant said.  ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs candidacy fits into a much longer term and more thoughtful approach than just one election cycle,‚Äù Democratic National Committee spokesman Pablo Manriquez said on Friday. He added that the party is focused on broader issues such as voting rights and the concerns of Latino families for this election and beyond.    Participants at the meeting also told the party they didn‚Äôt see enough Latinos in the pipeline for future leadership positions, including elected office around the country, according to the meeting notes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just infrastructure for political participation, but how to get people to run for office, how to teach people to run their own campaigns,‚Äù said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, which had a representative at the meeting.

Cleveland officials to outline security for Republican Convention,"(Reuters) - The mayor and police chief of Cleveland next week will outline what security measures they would take for the Republican National Convention, officials said after a civil rights group and a police union criticized aspects of the preparations.   Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has drawn intense protests at campaign stops this year. At times the demonstrations have resulted in violence between his supporters and opponents. Officials in Cleveland are gearing up for the thousands of demonstrators expected outside the convention, scheduled from July 18 to 21. The event will culminate with the party anointing the billionaire real estate developer as its nominee for the November general election. Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson will join the police chief and other city officials on Tuesday to present a ‚Äúcomprehensive overview of security preparations‚Äù for the convention, the mayor said in a statement. ‚ÄúDespite rumors, the Division of Police is prepared and is on track with its planning goals,‚Äù the statement said. The announcement comes after the American Civil Liberties Union on May 19 accused the city of taking too long to issue permits to protesters planning demonstrations at the convention.  The city has since said it will allow application for permits starting on Tuesday, the same day officials will outline security plans. The Cleveland Police Patrolmen‚Äôs Association also has objected to certain parts of the city‚Äôs plan. The union filed a grievance over an order prohibiting officers from taking vacations for several days before and after the convention. That prompted an arbitrator to order the city to pay overtime to officers who would lose out on vacation time, according to a copy of the ruling posted at news website Cleveland.com. Cleveland officials are marshalling a force of about 5,000 officers, including police from other law enforcement agencies, to provide security for the convention, City Council members have said. Council members earlier this month raised questions about the lack of transparency in Cleveland‚Äôs plans for the convention. But Police Chief Calvin Williams has said the city must withhold certain information to stymie anyone seeking to disrupt the convention. He has declined to say how many officers will be assigned to the event. Protests against Trump dogged his appearance on Friday in San Diego, where more than 1,000 demonstrators turned up and 35 were arrested, and on Tuesday night in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters threw rocks and bottles at police.

"Trump's San Diego rally draws more than 1,000 chanting protesters","SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Donald Trump brought his message of walls and deportations to the doorstep of America‚Äôs busiest border crossing on Friday as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee greeted supporters in San Diego, amid one of the largest counter-protests organized against him. The scene inside the San Diego Convention Center during Trump‚Äôs speech was relatively placid, while outside demonstrators opposed to his controversy-ridden White House bid marched and chanted, carrying signs criticizing his rhetoric against illegal immigration.  Waving U.S. and Mexican flags, more than 1,000 people turned out for anti-trump rallies in San Diego, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border whose San Ysidro port of entry sees nearly 300,000 people a day cross legally between the countries. San Diego is considered a binational city by many who live and work on opposite sides of the border, and about a third of the city‚Äôs population is Latino. During Trump‚Äôs speech on Friday, some protesters outside the convention center scaled a barrier and lobbed water bottles at police. One man was pulled off the wall and arrested as others were surrounded by fellow protesters and backed away from the confrontation.  After the convention center emptied, clusters of Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators began to mix in the streets, many exchanging shouted epithets and some throwing water bottles at one another.  Police in riot gear declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and ordered the crowd to disperse, herding the crowd out of the city‚Äôs hotel and restaurant-filled Gaslamp Quarter. San Diego police said on Twitter that 35 arrests were made during the protest. No property damage or injuries were reported, police said.  ‚ÄúFantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally,‚Äù Trump tweeted to police afterwards.  Trump has weathered months of blowback from all ends of the political spectrum for his immigration policy, which calls for the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants who reside in the United States. Critics have said his plan is needlessly cruel and impossible to implement. At Trump‚Äôs campaign stops, attendees often chant ‚Äúbuild the wall.‚Äù While Trump is running unopposed in the June 7 California Republican primary, his stance on border control and deportation seems unlikely to resonate with the electorate at large in a state where political fallout from a Republican-backed crackdown on illegal immigrants 20 years ago cost the party dearly.     Friday was not the first time Trump has been greeted by civil unrest in California, which is home to the largest Latino population in the country. Late last month, a visit to the California Republican convention set off days of protests in the area, leading to several arrests.  Shortly before taking the stage in San Diego, Trump issued a statement ruling out a one-on-one debate with second-place Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, who was also in California, killing off a potentially high-ratings television spectacle. The suggested debate, an idea first raised during a talk show appearance by the New York billionaire, would have sidelined likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but given Sanders a huge platform ahead of California Democratic primary.     A day after saying he would welcome a Sanders debate, Trump called the idea ‚Äúinappropriate,‚Äù declaring that he should only face the Democrats‚Äô final choice. ‚ÄúI will wait to debate the first-place finisher in the Democratic Party, probably Crooked Hillary Clinton,‚Äù Trump said in a statement. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, expressed disappointment on Friday, and sought to goad Trump into reconsidering. ‚ÄúWell, Mr. Trump, what are you afraid of?‚Äù he said in a video clip posted on ABC News‚Äô Twitter account. Trump suggested broadcast networks were unwilling to go along with his demand that at least $10 million raised from the encounter be donated to charity. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to debate Bernie,‚Äù he told a rally in Fresno, California. ‚ÄúBut the networks want to keep the money for themselves.‚Äù     Sanders is trailing Clinton in the race to secure their party‚Äôs nomination, but opinion polls show he is slicing into her lead in California. Clinton has shown no interest in debating Sanders before the California primary, which will be part of a final slate of nominating contests. It is possible she will clinch the nomination by winning New Jersey earlier that day, making the outcome in California superfluous.  The former U.S. secretary of state has said she is looking forward to debating Trump later this year ahead of the Nov. 8 general election. Clinton leads Trump by 4 percentage points in the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. Democrats nationally remain evenly split between Clinton and Sanders.     ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 "
U.S. deportation raids target Central American families: lawyers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials have kicked off a new round of raids intended to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children who have entered the country illegally, according to a legal group that works with the immigrants. Immigration enforcement officers as of Friday had arrested about 40 women and children encompassing at least 18 Central American family groups in Texas, North Carolina, South Dakota and possibly other states, said Laura Lichter, an immigration lawyer and a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Reuters reported on May 12 that the raids were planned for May and June and likely would be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of President Barack Obama this year after similar raids in which 121 people were arrested over two days in January. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea declined to confirm that the new round of raids had begun but defended the administration‚Äôs deportation operations as a whole. ‚ÄúWe stress that these operations are limited to those who were apprehended at the border after January 1, 2014, have been ordered removed by an immigration court, and have no pending appeal or pending claim for asylum,‚Äù Elzea said. The immigrants arrested in the latest raids have been sent to two ICE detention centers in Texas, according to Belle Woods, a spokeswoman for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The deportation operations are intended to deter illegal immigration from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and curb crossings of the U.S.-Mexican border by Central Americans, U.S. officials have said. Lichter said ICE was not following its own policy in the raids. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same thing we saw in January. These people deserve asylum, but didn‚Äôt get a proper chance to have their cases heard,‚Äù Lichter said. The issue of illegal immigration has figured prominently in the U.S. presidential campaign, with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump promising to deport all roughly 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. The White House on May 13 defended its deportation policy after complaints from Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and congressional leaders that the sweep targeting Central American illegal immigrants is inhumane. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities,‚Äù Clinton said at the time.

Bathroom lawsuit could send transgender rights to Supreme Court,"(Reuters) - A lawsuit brought by Texas and other states against the Obama administration‚Äôs policy on bathroom access may move the United States closer to a resolution on transgender rights by putting the issue on a trajectory for the Supreme Court. Conservative officials from 11 states sued the federal government on Wednesday to overturn a directive that transgender students be allowed to use the bathroom matching their gender identity instead of being forced to use one corresponding to gender assigned at birth. The governor of a 12th state, Mississippi, said he planned to join the lawsuit. The country‚Äôs high court has never ruled on a main question of the lawsuit: Do federal legal protections against sex discrimination apply to transgender people? The plaintiffs picked a path that could get them two quick wins in lower courts. The lawsuit is expected to be heard first by an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush and if there is an appeal by a conservative federal appeals court covering Texas. If that appeals court ruled against the Obama administration, the Supreme Court may feel compelled to take up the matter because of a likely conflict with a ruling last month from a federal appeals court in Virginia. That ruling revived a transgender teen‚Äôs lawsuit against his school district.  The Supreme Court is more likely to agree to hear a case when there is a split among different federal appeals courts, and such a conflict does not yet exist on transgender rights.  The plaintiffs have accused the administration of President Barack Obama of overreaching its authority and said the U.S. Congress, or individual states, should set policy.  At least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which covers employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  When lawmakers passed the education amendments, they did not consider that the law could one day be applied to gender identity, said Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. ‚ÄúThe (administration‚Äôs) lawless interpretation ignores the will of Congress in enacting Title IX,‚Äù Tedesco said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a clear case of federal overreach.‚Äù The Obama administration has argued that the education amendments encompass discrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status. It said in a letter to school districts this month that their access to federal money depended on their compliance. The states that sued have two paths to victory, Tedesco said: a ruling that the Obama administration did not follow proper procedure for making new regulations, which would leave the larger issue unsettled, or that its interpretation of Title IX is inconsistent with the law. Without clear guidance from the courts, the question of transgender rights would remain open to interpretation by federal agencies, meaning a future president could take the opposite view of Obama. The Republican-controlled Congress has the power to end the dispute immediately, either in favor of transgender rights or against them, but it has shown few signs of acting, especially with a Democrat, Obama, in the White House. A series of decisions suggests courts are coming around to a more expansive definition of sex discrimination, said Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders. Federal agencies clearly have the authority to interpret civil rights law when its application is unclear, she said. ‚ÄúTo characterize (the administration‚Äôs position) as extraordinary or overreaching shows a complete misunderstanding of what these agencies do,‚Äù Levi said. The states countered in their lawsuit that the federal agencies went beyond mere interpretation of civil rights law and in effect created new regulations that should have gone through a notice-and-comment procedure. A court could also find that the states‚Äô lawsuit was premature because the Obama administration has not yet moved to cut off funding to any state or school district, said Arthur Leonard, a professor at New York Law School and an expert on LGBT law.

Senators want Obama to impose sanctions on Congo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators called on President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration on Friday to impose targeted sanctions on officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo responsible for violence and rights violations amid rising political tensions. Hoping to increase pressure on the government of President Joseph Kabila, three of Obama‚Äôs fellow Democrats, senators Richard Durbin, Edward Markey and Christopher Murphy, said on Friday they had introduced a Senate resolution this week calling on Kabila‚Äôs government to fulfill its constitutional mandate for a democratic transition of power late this year. They called for targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, until Kabila publicly commits to a peaceful transition of power. Their action reflected growing international worry over the situation in the African nation. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday voiced concern about reports of rising political tension due to uncertainty about the presidential election.  Dozens of Kabila critics have been arrested since last year as part of what the United Nations and rights groups say is an escalating crackdown on political dissent ahead of a presidential election scheduled for November. Kabila is ineligible to stand for re-election after serving two elected terms, but opponents accuse him of trying to delay the poll to hold onto power. Congo‚Äôs highest court ruled last week that the president could stay in power if elections did not occur by the end of his mandate. On Thursday, a protester and a police officer were killed in Goma, in the eastern part of the country, during protests against a possible elections delay. The United Nations said dozens of people were arrested. Opposition leaders accuse Kabila of stalling the vote in order to extend his 15-year rule, which the president denies. Democratic congressional aides said they expected to add more co-sponsors for the resolution after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess on June 6. There is bipartisan support for U.S. action to address the situation.  Republican Senator Jeff Flake, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee‚Äôs Africa subcommittee, told Reuters in a brief interview this week that he felt sanctions would be appropriate and had discussed them with U.S. State Department officials. ‚ÄúHopefully we‚Äôre together on this,‚Äù Flake said. ‚ÄúI think we will be.

N.J.

The bills will help reform the city‚Äôs ‚Äúoverblown municipal government‚Äù while protecting state and local taxpayers, Christie said in a statement while continuing to take shots at local officials. ‚ÄúWe all agree that Atlantic City‚Äôs government has not demonstrated the competence to properly manage the people‚Äôs money without state guidance and oversight,‚Äù he said.  The legislation ‚Äúembraces my demand that Atlantic City immediately account for every dollar it receives and spends, and triggers a series of strict conditions and rigorous requirements the city must meet immediately,‚Äù Christie said. Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Friday, Guardian marked the opening of summer beach season for the seaside resort city. The bills provide a $60 million, six-month bridge loan from the state to the city and establish $120 million of payments annually from casinos in lieu of property taxes, a move aimed at stabilizing the city‚Äôs volatile, eroded tax base. In return, the city must prepare a balanced budget for fiscal 2017, which begins Jan. 1, and a five-year recovery plan. If it falls short, the state can move to take over operations and throw out collective bargaining agreements, among other powers. The package could prove positive for the city‚Äôs credit rating, which is deep in junk territory at Caa3, because it provides much-needed financial relief and removes the immediate threat of default or bankruptcy, Moody‚Äôs Investors Service said after the governor announced his signature.

"Trump tower in Canada close to sale, future of name in question","TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto‚Äôs Trump tower is close to being sold, a lawyer for its owner said on Friday, adding that the buyer could choose to drop the name, which has become more controversial since billionaire Donald Trump became the presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee. The Trump organization disagreed, saying the building must continue to carry the name. Symon Zucker, who represents Talon International Development Inc, said the 65-story hotel and condominium tower in the city‚Äôs financial district has found a potential buyer and the sale will conclude ‚Äúhopefully shortly.‚Äù The building is operated for Talon by the Trump Hotel Collection, presided over by Trump and his children.  Zucker said the current contract with Trump Hotel is ‚Äúexclusive with Talon‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe new owner can if he wishes retain a different manager and change the name of the hotel.‚Äù Zucker declined to comment on the potential new owner‚Äôs intentions or the specifics of the deal. Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten disagreed, saying the agreement is valid for ‚Äúanother 16 years‚Äù and calling Zucker‚Äôs view ‚Äú100 percent false.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe management‚Äôs agreement between Trump and the condos would remain in full force and effect,‚Äù he said in an email. ‚ÄúWe are not going anywhere.‚Äù  Garten said if the new owner wants to change the name of the tower, the Trump Organization would take ‚Äúswift and appropriate action to prevent it and hold them liable for damages.‚Äù Talon Chairman Alex Shnaider has been trying to change the building‚Äôs name through arbitration, though the sale is unrelated to that effort, said Zucker, who called the sale a routine business decision. ‚ÄúAlex is moving on to other deals,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is just one more thing he‚Äôs bought that he‚Äôs going to sell.‚Äù Zucker said the deal was done through the real estate firm CBRE, which declined to comment.  The luxury building has had problems, and the intersection around it has been closed several times due to falling or unstable glass. The tower is also the subject of a Canadian lawsuit against Trump and associates by disgruntled investors who say they were misled in their deals.  A judge ruled against the investors, and a Toronto court is scheduled to hear their appeal in June. Zucker called their case ‚Äúfrivolous.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 "
Illinois budget talks fizzle amid partisan entrenchment,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (Reuters) - Bipartisan talks to reach a fiscal 2017 budget for Illinois ahead of a Tuesday deadline have derailed as the state‚Äôs Republican governor and top Democrat refused to budge from their demands. The two sides have been at an impasse since last year, leaving Illinois as the only state without a complete budget for the fiscal year that ends on June 30. Bipartisan, rank-and-file working groups pushed by Governor Bruce Rauner have been meeting, with sporadic reports that progress was being made on a budget for the new fiscal year. But following a short meeting on Friday with the governor, legislative leaders made it clear that common ground has not been reached. Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno accused Democrats of pulling the plug on negotiations. ‚ÄúThey want to push the balanced budget issue reforms off into the fall, after the election,‚Äù she told reporters. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear their priority is political and not for the good of the state.‚Äù House Speaker Michael Madigan defended the budget passed by Democrats in his chamber this week, saying he is not willing to hold residents ‚Äúhostage‚Äù while the governor expands his demands for pro-business and anti-union reforms. ‚ÄúThere will be a complaint the state does not have sufficient money to pay for that budget,‚Äù Madigan said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôve said for the last year and a half, I‚Äôm prepared to negotiate with the governor to find the money to pay for those services.‚Äù House Republicans blasted the $14.1 billion general funds budget passed on Wednesday and again on Thursday by Democrats as being $7.2 billion short on revenue because the spending plan does not include big costs like pensions and debt payments. Madigan, who has advocated a so-called millionaires‚Äô tax, said his first revenue choice would be taxing the wealthy through exclusions and deductions in the Illinois income tax code, including the earned income tax credit. Rauner contended negotiations were continuing. But he warned that the fifth-largest U.S. state must stop spending money it does not have.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll never have balanced budgets if we don‚Äôt grow our economy and we need reforms to grow our economy, get more jobs and higher family incomes,‚Äù he said.  House Republicans pleaded with Democrats during Friday‚Äôs session to break with Madigan and continue to work with them. ‚ÄúMy request is that you don‚Äôt give up,‚Äù said House Republican Jim Durkin, who added that a deal was close.

Trump's pro-oil agenda poses dilemma for North Dakota's Indians,"TRENTON, N.D. (Reuters) - When Donald Trump laid out his plan this week to roll back U.S. environmental regulations to boost the ailing energy industry, it raised both the hopes and fears of the American Indians living near the heart of the country‚Äôs richest oil fields. The Republican presidential contender‚Äôs agenda, laid out at an oil industry conference on Thursday in North Dakota, could bring desperately needed jobs to depressed communities that have come to depend on the oil drilling industry, but could also trigger worse pollution of Indian lands.  ‚ÄúWe would like to see more drilling,‚Äù said Gene McCowan, human resources director for the Trenton Indian Service Area, which governs the six counties in North Dakota and Montana where 2,600 Turtle Mountain Chippewa live.  ‚ÄúBut we are caught in a bind because people are concerned about fracking and how that will affect the earth and water,‚Äù he said. The dilemma facing North Dakota‚Äôs American Indians represents the broader tensions at play in the U.S. presidential election between jobs and the environment, as Trump and his likely Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, clash over energy and climate change.  Trump on Thursday announced to a cheering crowd of roughly 7,700 people that he would sweep away initiatives by President Barack Obama to curb U.S. emissions and protect waterways from pollution, as ways to revive drilling and coal mining sectors that are in the middle of a steep downturn.  Clinton and her rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, meanwhile, have advocated a sharp move away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy sources to cut pollution and slow climate change. The split is felt sharply by the Chippewa, people who have been hard hit by both the global oil market crash since 2014, as well as the environmental impacts of the preceding drilling boom that spread drillpads and pipelines across the landscape. ‚ÄúTwenty percent of our people have been laid off or seen cuts in salaries and it‚Äôs going to get worse,‚Äù McCowan said, adding that he will likely support Trump as the best hope of reversing the crisis. Trenton is 14 miles southwest of oil boom town Williston. Until a year or so ago, locals were making $25-$30 an hour. Now, McCowan said, the number of people needing food stamps has risen 40 percent. Residents said Democratic candidate Sanders has the most to say about income inequality and Native Americans issues, but is also most likely to curb fossil fuel development, depriving people of what they see as their economic lifeline.  Trump could be a hard pill to swallow for other reasons, other Native Americans in North Dakota said. Ahead of his speech on Thursday, Nicole Robertson, a 41-year-old Cree Indian and communications strategist for the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara nations - known as the Three Affiliated Tribes - tried to ask Trump if he would recognize tribal sovereignty when it comes to land where oil is produced.¬†Trump said he would have to look into it.  She later interrupted Trump when he launched an attack on Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, repeatedly calling her ‚ÄúPocahantas‚Äù - a reference to her claim she is part Native American. Robertson shouted out that his comments were ‚Äúvery offensive,‚Äù interrupting his news conference. She said afterward that she felt it was important that Native Americans be consulted on oil policy, both because of its economic importance and its environmental impacts. ‚ÄúA lot of opportunities have come with the boom in the Bakken region in North Dakota,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut we as indigenous people are original land stewards. It‚Äôs in our genes.‚Äù She did not say who she would vote for in the election.  American¬†Indians make up around 5 percent of North Dakota‚Äôs population. Kenneth Hall, a tribal councilman for the Three Affiliated Tribes, said he was also rankled by Trump‚Äôs speech - even though it promised a much-needed economic revival. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt even mentioned by Mr. Trump ... and nearly a quarter of oil production in the state comes out of our reservation lands,‚Äù he said. He said the tribes requested a meeting with Trump ahead of his energy speech but that Trump‚Äôs team did not respond. ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 "
"Trump, Sanders explore staging unusual presidential debate","BISMARCK, N.D. (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders on Thursday explored staging an unconventional U.S. presidential debate  that would sideline Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and create a television spectacle that could attract huge ratings. The two men - a billionaire and a democratic socialist - expressed interest in a one-on-one encounter in California even though Republican and Democratic presidential candidates traditionally do not debate each other until the parties have selected their nominees. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to debate Bernie,‚Äù Trump told reporters in North Dakota, after he secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. ‚ÄúI think it would get very high ratings. It would be in a big arena.‚Äù Basking in his newly sealed nomination at a later campaign rally in Billings, Montana, Trump said he expected to put 15 states in play in the general election, compared with three or four for a traditional Republican. He named California, Washington and Michigan among others.  Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email there were no formal plans yet for a debate. But Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN there had been ‚Äúa few discussions‚Äù between the campaigns about the details.         ‚ÄúWe hope that he will not chicken out,‚Äù Weaver said. ‚ÄúWe hope Donald Trump has the courage to get on stage now that he said he would.‚Äù     Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is running far behind Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  But a nationally televised debate with the presumptive Republican nominee would be a big boost to his chances in the California primary on June 7, when Clinton is likely to clinch the nomination.         Trump said a debate with Sanders could raise up to $15 million for charity. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to debate Bernie, but they‚Äôll have to pay a lot of money for it,‚Äù he said. The idea was hatched during an appearance by Trump on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live‚Äù late on Wednesday. Kimmel said he asked Trump about the debate at the suggestion of Sanders. ‚ÄúGame on,‚Äù Sanders tweeted. ‚ÄúI look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.‚Äù Sanders himself appeared on Thursday night on the talk show, where he said Kimmel made it possible for a ‚Äúvery interesting debate‚Äù between ‚Äútwo guys who look at the world very, very differently.‚Äù Sanders added that the goal would be to have the debate in a stadium in California. He then had a warning for Trump.  If I become the Democratic presidential nomination, he said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to beat him and beat him bad.‚Äù Clinton, who backed out of an agreement to debate Sanders before the California vote, said she did not think a Trump-Sanders showdown would happen. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt sound like a serious discussion. I‚Äôm looking forward to debating Donald Trump in the general election. I really can‚Äôt wait to get on the stage with him,‚Äù she told CNN in a phone interview. A Fox News spokeswoman confirmed the network was trying to host a forum with Trump and Sanders. Representatives from other networks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ‚ÄúIf it does come to pass, it would generate enormous ratings,‚Äù said Alan Schroeder, a Northeastern University professor who has written extensively about presidential debates. ‚ÄúThey are from two different planets. You have a real personality contrast. It would dominate media coverage.‚Äù Sanders, who has promised to continue his campaign through the Democratic nominating convention in July, has said he will do everything he can to ensure that Trump does not win the White House.         ‚ÄúSmart and bold move by Sanders,‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said. ‚ÄúThe Clinton people are furious but Bernie wins points for being so aggressive.‚Äù Clinton has tried to woo Sanders supporters as she turns her attention to the general election. But some Democrats worry his supporters - who are largely young, working-class and disillusioned with the Democratic Party establishment - will turn instead to political neophyte Trump, who has championed a populist agenda.     The debate would give Trump a national forum to criticize Clinton and try to win over Sanders supporters ahead of an expected Trump-Clinton general election contest, Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said. ‚ÄúI think Sanders should think long and hard about giving Trump a forum,‚Äù Kofinis said. ‚ÄúIt crosses a line, but apparently in this election there is no line.‚Äù           Dale Ranney, 62, a Trump volunteer who has been to 21 of his rallies, said she would be delighted to see Trump and Sanders debate. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a great idea, any time you can get more information to the people, absolutely,‚Äù Ranney said. ‚ÄúHaving Trump debate a socialist? Absolutely. Go for it.‚Äù    ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 "
Trump vows to undo Obama's climate agenda in appeal to oil sector,"BISMARCK, N.D. (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, promised on Thursday to roll back some of America‚Äôs most ambitious environmental policies, actions that he said would revive the ailing U.S. oil and coal industries and bolster national security. Among the proposals, Trump said he would pull the United States out of the U.N. global climate accord, approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and rescind measures by President Barack Obama to cut U.S. emissions and protect waterways from industrial pollution. ‚ÄúAny regulation that‚Äôs outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers or contrary to the national interest will be scrapped and scrapped completely,‚Äù Trump told about 7,700 people at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in Bismarck, the capital of oil-rich North Dakota. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do all this while taking proper regard for rational environmental concerns.‚Äù   It was Trump‚Äôs first speech detailing the energy policies he would advance if elected president. He received loud applause from the crowd of oil executives. The comments painted a stark contrast between the New York billionaire and his Democratic rivals for the White House, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who advocate a sharp turn away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy technologies to combat climate change. Trump slammed both rivals in his speech, saying their policies would kill jobs and force the United States ‚Äúto be begging for oil again‚Äù from Middle East producers.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to happen. Not with me,‚Äù he said. Trump‚Äôs comments drew quick criticism from environmental advocates, who called his proposals ‚Äúfrightening.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs energy policies would accelerate climate change, protect corporate polluters who profit from poisoning our air and water, and block the transition to clean energy that is necessary to strengthen our economy and protect our climate and health,‚Äù said Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist. But industry executives cheered the stance. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple. If Trump wins, oil field workers will be happy. If Clinton wins, oil workers will be unhappy,‚Äù said Derrick Alexander, an operations manager at oilfield services firm Integrated Productions Services. Trump hit Clinton hard in his speech, saying the former secretary of state would be more aggressive than Obama on regulations. He repeated several times Clinton‚Äôs March comments that her policies would put coal miners out of work. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton‚Äôs agenda is job destruction,‚Äù Trump said. Trump said slashing regulation would help the United States achieve energy independence and reduce America‚Äôs reliance on Middle Eastern producers. ‚ÄúImagine a world in which oil cartels will no longer use energy as a weapon,‚Äù he said. The United States currently produces about 55 percent of the oil it uses, with another quarter of the total coming from Canada and Mexico, and less than 20 percent coming from OPEC, according to U.S. Energy Department statistics. Trump‚Äôs advisers, including U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, have said they suggested Trump examine the role of OPEC in the global oil price slump since 2014, which has contributed to the demise of a handful of smaller U.S. oil companies. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have declined to cut production to support prices.          Until Thursday, Trump had been short on details of his energy policy. He has said he believes global warming is a hoax, that his administration would revive the U.S. coal industry, and that he supports hydraulic fracturing - an environmentally controversial drilling technique that has triggered a boom in U.S. production. Earlier this month, he told Reuters in an interview that he would renegotiate ‚Äúat a minimum‚Äù the U.N. global climate accord agreed by 195 countries in Paris last December, saying he viewed the deal as bad for U.S. business. He took that a step further in North Dakota. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to cancel the Paris climate agreement,‚Äù he said. Trump also promised he would invite Canadian pipeline company TransCanada (TRP.TO) to reapply to build the Keystone XL pipeline into the United States, reversing a decision by Obama to block the project over environmental concerns. ‚ÄúI want it built, but I want a piece of the profits,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to make our country rich again.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs pledge briefly sent TransCanada‚Äôs shares 29 Canadian cents higher to C$54.13 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, but the stock quickly leveled back off and close up 2 Canadian cents at C$53.86. In response to Trump‚Äôs promise that he would seek more profits from the pipeline, TransCanada spokesman James Millar noted the project would create jobs, offer major contracts to U.S. suppliers and provide tens of millions in taxes for state coffers.  ‚ÄúThe pipeline will benefit American workers longer term as the companies they work for have signed contracts to ship and refine oil through Keystone XL,‚Äù Millar said in an email.

Clinton says she understands U.S. voter concerns about emails report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Thursday she was confident voters would make the ‚Äúright decision‚Äù despite concerns over findings by an internal government watchdog that her use of a private email server while secretary of state broke government rules. ‚ÄúI know people have concerns about this, I understand that,‚Äù Clinton said in an interview broadcast on MSNBC, referring to the findings by the State Department inspector general in a report made public on Wednesday. The email controversy and a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into whether laws were broken as a result of Clinton‚Äôs use of a server kept in her New York home have overshadowed the Democratic front-runner‚Äôs campaign.

Push to expand FBI surveillance authority threatens U.S. email privacy bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An effort in the U.S. Senate to expand the Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs authority to use a secretive surveillance order has delayed a vote on a popular email privacy bill, casting further doubt on whether the legislation will become law this year. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday postponed consideration of a measure that would require government authorities to obtain a search warrant before asking technology companies, such as Microsoft  and Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google , to hand over old emails. A version of the Senate bill unanimously passed the House last month. Currently, federal agencies do not need a warrant to access emails or other digital communications more than 180 days old due to a provision in a 1986 law that considers them abandoned by the owner.  But Republican party senators offered amendments Thursday that privacy advocates argued contravened the purpose of the underlying bill and would likely sink its chances of becoming law. Those amendments include one by Senator John Cornyn, the second ranking Republican in the Senate, that would broaden the FBI‚Äôs authority to deploy an administrative subpoena known as a National Security Letter to include electronic communications transaction records such as the times tamps of emails and their senders and recipients. Senators Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee, the Democratic and Republican authors of the email privacy bill, agreed to postpone the vote to give time to lawmakers to review the amendments and other provisions of the bill that have prompted disagreement.  NSLs do not require a warrant and are almost always accompanied by a gag order preventing the service provider from sharing the request with a targeted user.  The letters have existed since the 1970s, though the scope and frequency of their use expanded greatly after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.  In 2015 requests for customer records via NSLs increased nearly 50 percent to 48,642 requests, up from 33,024 in 2014, according to a U.S. government transparency report. The Obama administration has for years lobbied for a change to how NSLs can be used, after a 2008 legal memo from the Justice Department said the law limits them largely to phone billing records. FBI Director James Comey has said the change needed essentially corrects a typo. The Senate Intelligence Committee this week passed a bill to fund the U.S. intelligence community that contains a similar provision that would allow NSLs to be used to gather email records.  Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, voted against the proposal and said it ‚Äútakes a hatchet to important protections for Americans‚Äô liberty.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 "
Vietnam restricted access to Facebook during Obama visit: activists,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Vietnamese government restricted access to Facebook Inc inside Vietnam for several days this week as part of a broader crackdown on human rights and political dissidents during a visit by President Barack Obama, two activist organizations said on Thursday.  Officials of Access Now, a digital rights organization, and Viet Tan, a Vietnamese pro-democracy group, said the social media site was restricted and at times blocked inside Vietnam from Sunday to Wednesday, citing reports from people inside the country on Twitter and to Access Now‚Äôs digital security help service.  The move coincides with a trend toward restrictions on Facebook in countries including China, Uganda and Turkey during politically sensitive times as the 1.6 billion-person social network grows more powerful.  Obama‚Äôs three-day visit to Vietnam ended on Wednesday. Obama largely focused on normalizing relations with Vietnam. But he also promoted human rights and chided Vietnam about restrictions on political freedoms after critics of its communist-run government were prevented from meeting him. The Facebook shutdown was part of a stepped-up campaign by the Vietnamese government to limit use of the social network for political protests, activists said in phone interviews.  Facebook was blocked several times earlier this month as street protests erupted over an environmental disaster that resulted in mass fish deaths, the two groups said. The social media site was also unavailable inside Vietnam ahead of parliamentary elections on Sunday as pro-democracy activists called for a boycott, members of the two groups said. Facebook declined to comment. Vietnamese government officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment submitted via a government website.  Uganda‚Äôs government blocked Facebook and Twitter Inc in February during presidential elections. In March, after a deadly bombing in Turkey, an Ankara court ordered a ban on access to Facebook and Twitter. And during the 2011 Arab Spring in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, social networks were repeatedly shut down.  Facebook is often shut down in Vietnam during politically sensitive times, Angelina Huynh, advocacy director for Viet Tan, which has members around the world, including in Vietnam, said in a phone interview.  ‚ÄúPeople were using Facebook to call for protests. They did not want people to take to the streets,‚Äù Huynh said.  ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 "
California mayors ask for governor's support for highway cameras after shootings,"(Reuters) - Five mayors in northern California on Thursday asked Governor Jerry Brown in a letter to have surveillance cameras installed on state highways in the area after a string of shootings that have gripped their communities.   The request came two days after a man was shot in the leg while traveling eastbound on I-80 in Hercules, California, the 28th such shooting on the state highway system east of San Francisco during the last six months, authorities said.   ‚ÄúThis is of increasing concern to our elected officials and residents who feel as if our communities are under siege,‚Äù said the letter signed by the mayors of Pinole, Richmond and Hercules. The mayors of San Pablo and El Cerrito also signed the letter.  Since November 2015, four people have been killed and 12 wounded in shootings that authorities believe are largely gang related, the California Highway Patrol said in a statement. Local and state law enforcement agencies began targeting known gang members and increased patrols since the shootings began along the freeways, the patrol said.         The mayors asked Brown to support funding for the installation of surveillance cameras with recording capabilities on area freeway ramps and upgrades to current traffic cameras so they would be able to capture and retain images that could be used during investigations.  The mayors wrote the situation is a ‚Äúgrave and growing risk‚Äù  in their communities where freeways have become a ‚Äúbattleground.‚Äù Officials in Brown‚Äôs office were not immediately available for comment. San Pablo Mayor Rich Kinney said in an email to Reuters that the mayors, state transportation officials and governor staff are scheduled to meet to discuss the letter on June 6.  The California Highway Patrol said five suspects have been arrested in connection with the string of shootings, some of whom may have been involved in more than one incident.

Push for encryption law falters despite Apple case spotlight,"WASHINGTON/ SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - After a rampage that left 14 people dead in San Bernardino, key U.S. lawmakers pledged to seek a law requiring technology companies to give law enforcement agencies a ‚Äúback door‚Äù to encrypted communications and electronic devices, such as the iPhone used by one of the shooters. Now, only months later, much of the support is gone, and the push for legislation dead, according to sources in congressional offices, the administration and the tech sector.  Draft legislation that Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Intelligence Committee, had circulated weeks ago likely will not be introduced this year and, even if it were, would stand no chance of advancing, the sources said. Key among the problems was the lack of White House support for legislation in spite of a high-profile court showdown between the Justice Department and Apple Inc over the suspect iPhone, according to Congressional and Obama Administration officials and outside observers. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve dropped anchor and taken down the sail,‚Äù former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden said. For years, the Justice Department lobbied unsuccessfully for a way to unmask suspects who ‚Äúgo dark,‚Äù or evade detection through coded communications in locked devices. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation took Apple to court in February to try to open the iPhone in its investigation of the San Bernardino slayings, the cause gained traction in Washington. The political landscape had shifted - or so it seemed. The short life of the push for legislation illustrates the intractable nature of the debate over digital surveillance and encryption, which has been raging in one form or another since the 1990s. Tech companies, backed by civil liberties groups, insist that building law enforcement access into phones and other devices would undermine security for everyone-including the U.S. government itself. Law enforcement agencies maintain they need a way to monitor  phone calls, emails and text messages, along with access to encrypted data. Polls show the public is split on whether the government should have access to all digital data. The legal battle between the FBI and Apple briefly united many around the idea that Congress - not the courts - should decide the issue. But the consensus was fleeting. Feinstein‚Äôs Democratic colleagues on the Intelligence Committee - along with some key Republicans - backed away. The House never got on board. The CIA and NSA were ambivalent, according to several current and former intelligence officials, in part because officials in the agencies feared any new law would interfere with their own encryption efforts. Even supporters worried that if a bill were introduced but failed, it would give Apple and other tech companies another weapon to use in future court battles. Burr had said repeatedly that legislation was imminent. ¬†¬†¬† But last week, he and Feinstein told Reuters there was no timeline for the bill. Feinstein said she planned to talk to more tech stakeholders, and Burr said, ‚Äúbe patient.‚Äù In the meantime, tech companies have accelerated encryption efforts in the wake of the Apple case. The court showdown ended with a whimper when the FBI said it had found a way to get into the phone, and subsequently conceded privately it had found nothing of value. A week after the San Bernardino attack, Burr told Reuters passing encryption legislation was urgent because ‚Äúif we don‚Äôt, we will be reading about terrorist attacks on a more frequent basis.‚Äù FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee soon after that encryption was ‚Äúoverwhelmingly affecting‚Äù the investigation of murders, drug trafficking and child pornography. A week later, the Justice Department persuaded a judge to issue a sweeping order demanding Apple write software to open an iPhone used by San Bernardino suspect Sayeed Farook, who died in a shootout with law enforcement. Apple fought back, arguing, among other things, that only Congressional legislation could authorize what the court was demanding. Many saw the Justice Department‚Äôs move as a way to bring pressure on Congress to act. President Obama appeared to tacitly support Comey‚Äôs court fight and the idea that there should be limits on criminal suspects‚Äô ability to hide behind encryption. But even as the drive for legislation seemed to be gaining momentum, consensus was dissipating. Senator Lindsey Graham, an influential Republican, withdrew  support in a sudden about-face. ‚ÄúI was all with you until I actually started getting briefed by the people in the intel community,‚Äù Graham told Attorney General Loretta Lynch during a hearing in March. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a person that‚Äôs been moved by the arguments of the precedent we set and the damage we may be doing to our own national security.‚Äù On the Democratic side, Senator Ron Wyden vowed to filibuster what he called a ‚Äúdangerous proposal,‚Äù that ‚Äúwould leave Americans more vulnerable to stalkers, identity thieves, foreign hackers and criminals.‚Äù  Senator Mark Warner advanced a competing bill to form a commission to study the issue.  A half dozen people familiar with the White House deliberations said they were hamstrung by a long-standing split within the Obama Administration, pitting Comey and the DOJ against technology advisors and other agencies including the Commerce and State Departments.[L2N16C1UC] They also said there was reluctance to take on the tech industry in an election year.

Ohio appeals U.S. court decision in favor of early voting,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The state of Ohio filed a federal court appeal on Thursday seeking to restore a Republican-backed limit on early voting and accelerated voter-registration measures that were seen by civil rights groups as boosting minority turnout. U.S. District Judge Michael Watson in Columbus ruled on Tuesday that Ohio violated voters‚Äô rights by reducing the period that ballots could be cast before an election to four weeks   from five weeks. Watson‚Äôs decision also struck down Ohio‚Äôs elimination of a seven-day window during which residents could both register to vote and cast their ballots all in the same week - a period known as ‚ÄúGolden Week.‚Äù Ohio‚Äôs Republican-controlled legislature abolished ‚ÄúGolden Week‚Äù and shortened early voting by seven days in 2014, drawing a legal challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Watson sided with the ACLU and NAACP in finding that both changes, which critics said directly limited opportunities for minority participation in elections, violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and were unconstitutional. On Thursday, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, petitioned the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review Watson‚Äôs decision, which he said scrapped a court-approved settlement the state previously reached with the ACLU and NAACP on early voting. The settlement allowed voters to cast ballots on multiple Sundays leading up to a presidential election and provided for additional evening voting hours, according to ACLU documents. Husted said Golden Week had become an administrative problem for state elections officials and increased the potential for voter fraud, arguing its elimination had broad bipartisan support. The Ohio Democratic Party countered with a statement accusing Republican state officials of ‚Äúdefending a law that clear data showed imposed a stark discriminatory impact on Ohio‚Äôs African-American voters.‚Äù The appeal came a day after the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation that would require any resident or organization to post a cash bond with a local court in order to keep polling stations open later than scheduled on election day.

Flap in Congress over gender identity sinks spending bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The rancorous political debate over sexual identity unexpectedly prompted the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to reject an energy and water spending bill on Thursday after Democrats attached an amendment to protect the rights of transgender people. The legislation, which would provide funds for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, failed on a 112-305 vote, with 130 Republicans and 175 Democrats opposing the legislation. The outcome was such a surprise that the House Appropriations Committee initially announced the bill had passed and was forced to retract the statement.  Democrats blamed Republicans for opposing a Democratic amendment to bar federal contractors from government work if they discriminate against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. Democrats failed to attach the same measure to a separate House spending bill last week. ‚ÄúIn turning against a far-reaching funding bill simply because it affirms protections for LGBT Americans, Republicans have once again lain bare the depths of their bigotry,‚Äù House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. But Republicans accused Democrats of working to sabotage the House appropriations process by voting 6-175 against the bill after they had succeeded in amending it. House Speaker Paul Ryan said his own decision not to keep legislation under tight control had created conditions for ‚Äúmore amendments from both sides of the aisle ... and, yes, more unpredictability.‚Äù   ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what happened here today. It‚Äôs unfortunate, because this is a very good bill,‚Äù Ryan said. He vowed to continue pushing the energy and water bill, along with other appropriations measures. Democrats said they opposed two Republican amendments. One would prevent Washington from witholding federal funds from North Carolina over its law on LGBT bathroom use. The other would have stopped the Democrats‚Äô LGBT amendment from affecting religious workplace exemptions. The White House had already threatened to veto the legislation over other provisions that Democrats said would undermine the Clean Water Act.  ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 "
Mississippi governor to join suit against Obama transgender policy,"(Reuters) - Mississippi‚Äôs Republican governor said on Thursday he planned to join a lawsuit by officials from 11 states to overturn an Obama administration directive that tells schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity. The lawsuit led by Texas, the most significant legal challenge to this month‚Äôs directive, said the federal government and Obama administration officials overreached their authority by taking actions that should be left to Congress or individual states. ‚ÄúOur office has talked to the Texas attorney general‚Äôs office and I intend, as soon as possible, to join the lawsuit against this latest example of federal overreach,‚Äù Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement. As with some of the other states, Mississippi‚Äôs governor and attorney general disagree on the suit, which challenges the administration‚Äôs interpretation that federal civil rights laws against sex discrimination should apply to transgender people. Mississippi‚Äôs attorney general, Democrat Jim Hood, declined to participate in the lawsuit, according to Clay Chandler, a spokesman for the governor. Chandler said Bryant will work with an attorney in the governor‚Äôs office in joining the lawsuit. Hood‚Äôs office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amid a national debate on transgender rights, President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority. Texas was joined by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus Arizona‚Äôs Department of Education and Maine‚Äôs governor. The lawsuit said the administration ‚Äúconspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights.‚Äù Transgender rights advocates criticized the suit as a malicious attack, saying there have never been public safety incidents or invasions of privacy related to¬†protections for transgender people. ‚ÄúWhile the department will review the complaint, the federal government has strong legal foundations to uphold the civil rights of transgender Americans,‚Äù the Justice Department said in a statement on Wednesday.

"Sanders may debate Trump, not Clinton, before California contest","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An unconventional debate between a billionaire Republican and a democratic socialist is shaping up in California after presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders expressed an interest in squaring off against each other. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is still in a primary battle against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, while Trump effectively clinched the Republican Party‚Äôs nomination earlier this month when his two remaining rivals dropped out. In an appearance on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live‚Äù late Wednesday, Trump said he was willing to participate in such an event against Sanders. ‚ÄúIf I debated him, we would have such high ratings,‚Äù the New York developer and reality television star said. ‚ÄúI think I should ... take that money and give it to some worthy charity.‚Äù Sanders appeared to agree in a post on Twitter on Thursday. ‚ÄúGame on,‚Äù he tweeted. ‚ÄúI look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.‚Äù Trump and Sanders have gone through a series of debates against rivals within their parties but Republican and Democratic presidential candidates usually do not debate each other until the parties have selected a nominee. The hashtag #BernieTrumpDebate began trending in the United States with news of the possible debate. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email to Reuters on Thursday there were no formal plans yet for such an event. Representatives for the Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kimmel said he asked Trump about the debate at the suggestion of Sanders, who is scheduled to appear on the show Thursday night. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who was elected to Congress as an independent and has made economic equality a keystone of his campaign, had first challenged Clinton to a California debate. He said he was disappointed when the former secretary of state declined. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to a possible Trump-Sanders debate. Clinton has tried to woo Sanders supporters as she works to secure the party‚Äôs nomination for the Nov. 8 election. But some worry his supporters - who are largely young, working-class and disillusioned with party establishment - will turn instead to political neophyte Trump, who has championed a populist agenda. Sanders has said he will do everything he can to ensure that Trump does not win the White House. ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 "

Oops! Senator's article tells of phantom meeting with Obama nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch wrote in an opinion piece published on Thursday that his meeting with Merrick Garland failed to change his view that the Senate should not act on President Barack Obama‚Äôs U.S. Supreme Court nominee. The problem is that no such meeting had yet taken place. Later in the day, the Utah senator issued a statement announcing that he would meet with Garland on Thursday, calling the appeals court judge ‚Äúan honorable public servant who deserves our respect‚Äù but reiterating that the Senate should not act now. Paul Edwards, executive editor of the Deseret News in Hatch‚Äôs home state of Utah, said by email the article was a draft that was mistakenly published on newspaper‚Äôs website, and apologized to Hatch and the newspaper‚Äôs readers for ‚Äúthis unfortunate error.‚Äù ‚ÄúLike many of my Senate colleagues, I recently met with Chief Judge Merrick Garland,‚Äù Hatch wrote in the piece. ‚ÄúOur meeting, however, does not change my conviction that the Senate should consider a Supreme Court nominee after this presidential election cycle,‚Äù Hatch added. The 82-year-old Hatch, first elected to the Senate in 1976, is the longest-serving Senate Republican and is a long-time and influential member of the Judiciary Committee that considers Supreme Court nominees. Hatch has joined with the Senate‚Äôs Republican leaders in asserting that Obama‚Äôs successor, to be determined in the Nov. 8 presidential election, should fill the vacancy left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February. Democrats have accused Senate Republicans of ignoring their constitutional duties by refusing to consider Garland‚Äôs nomination. A copy of the article was archived by Google after the Deseret News removed it. ‚ÄúThe electronic publication of this version, awaiting edits from the Senator following his meeting with Judge Garland, was inadvertent,‚Äù Edwards added. The article illustrated how unshakeable Republican opposition has been to Obama, a Democrat, appointing a replacement for Scalia. If a Democratic president appoints Scalia‚Äôs replacement, that would likely end decades of a conservative majority on the court. Obama nominated Garland on March 16. Hatch helped break a partisan log jam in the Senate against Garland two decades ago when President Bill Clinton nominated him to an appeals court. Garland won Senate confirmation in 1997.

South Carolina governor to sign ban on abortion past 19 weeks,"CHARLESTON, South Carolina (Reuters) - Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley on Wednesday signed into law a bill banning most abortions after 19 weeks of pregnancy unless the mother‚Äôs life is at risk, a spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.  The South Carolina legislature passed the bill last week, making it the 17th U.S. state to approve such a ban. A signing ceremony will take place on a date to be announced later, said Haley representative Chaney Adams.  The act, proposed last year in South Carolina‚Äôs Republican-controlled legislature, passed after it was stripped of exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest. The law allows abortions at the 20-week mark if the pregnancy endangers a mother‚Äôs life. It also includes a second exception if severe fatal abnormalities will mean the fetus would definitely die at full-term birth.  Sixteen other states have passed similar laws as conservatives have chipped away at the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion. Courts have overturned the bans in three states. ‚ÄúI believe that life begins at conception and every step we can take to get back to that point is important,‚Äù the bill‚Äôs sponsor, Republican Representative Wendy Nanney, told Reuters. ‚ÄúIn my view and many others‚Äô, it‚Äôs inhumane to subject that baby to pain at 20 weeks.‚Äù Critics have said the name of the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act goes against medical evidence showing that a fetus at 20 weeks cannot feel pain. The law also removes necessary medical options in the extremely rare instance that an abortion is recommended after 19 weeks, critics said.  ‚ÄúWe are incredibly disappointed in Governor Haley for signing HB 3114 into law today,‚Äù Jenny Black, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThis dangerous and politically-motivated measure bans abortion after 20 weeks with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest, and no consideration for a woman‚Äôs individual circumstances.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
"Obama: Trump displays ignorance, seeks tweets over solutions","ISE-SHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama disparaged U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday, saying the billionaire seeks tweets over solutions and has ‚Äúrattled‚Äù  foreign leaders with his pronouncements. Obama accused the real estate mogul and former reality TV impresario of making cavalier comments for provocative effect, and he urged all presidential candidates to take the high road in a boisterous and harsh campaign. Weighing in on the race to succeed him with his strongest broadside yet against Trump, Obama said fellow leaders from the Group of Seven nations ‚Äúare surprised by the Republican nominee‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements but they are rattled by them,‚Äù the president told a news conference on the sidelines of a G7 summit in central Japan. ‚ÄúFor good reason, because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines, instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe, secure and prosperous and the world on an even keel.‚Äù  Many U.S. allies fear Trump will feed insecurity in countries worried about China‚Äôs growing power, embolden nationalists and authoritarians, and unravel Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúpivot‚Äù to the Asia-Pacific.¬†¬†¬†¬†  Trump has also been accused of racism and bigotry for saying he would build a wall to keep out illegal Mexican immigrants and would temporarily ban Muslims from the United States. He has also made comments considered demeaning to women. The race between Trump on the one hand and the Democratic candidates, front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Senator Bernie Sanders, for the Nov. 8 election has become increasingly bitter and personal. Trump this week took his use of accusations against Clinton to levels unprecedented in modern U.S. presidential campaigns, making incendiary statements that television networks cannot resist covering, giving him hours of free media and putting his opponents on the defensive. Obama said it was natural for journalists in such a campaign to elevate ‚Äúevery roll, blink, speed bump, conflict, trash talkin‚Äô‚Äù, but urged, instead, that candidates from both sides  stick to the issues. ‚ÄúGrumpiness arises where folks feel that we‚Äôre not talking about issues but personalities or character.‚Äù  Obama, a Democrat, issued his most extensive analysis to date of his own party‚Äôs race, while refusing to take sides. He rejected a suggestion that beating Trump would get more difficult as the two parties‚Äô conventions approach in July, a period when the Democratic victor can focus on fighting Trump instead of the fellow Democrat, adding that the Democrat battle was tough. ‚ÄúArguing against your friends is more draining than arguing against political opponents,‚Äù Obama said. He said there were no big ideological differences between Clinton, an establishment candidate who is a former First Lady and senator, and Sanders, a firebrand populist who identifies as a Democratic Socialist. The president said it was important that the race eventually end in a way ‚Äúthat leaves both sides feeling proud of what they‚Äôve done.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 "
No masking Trump's popularity at Chinese Partytime Factory,"JINHUA, China (Reuters) - There‚Äôs no masking the facts. One Chinese factory is expecting Donald Trump to beat his likely U.S. presidential rival Hillary Clinton in the popularity stakes. At the Jinhua Partytime Latex Art and Crafts Factory, a Halloween and party supply business that produces thousands of rubber and plastic masks of everyone from Osama bin Laden to Spider-Man, masks of Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton faces are being churned out. Sales of the two presidential candidates are at about half a million each but the factory management believes Trump will eventually run out the winner. ‚ÄúEven though the sales are more or less the same, I think in 2016 this mask will completely sell out,‚Äù said factory manager Jacky Chen, indicating a Trump mask. The firm was already beginning to stockpile the Republican candidate‚Äôs mask, he said. Just like with the sales of the $4-$5 masks, Trump is now running nearly even with Clinton among likely U.S. voters ahead of the November election, a Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 11 showed.  That is a big turnaround for the real estate billionaire once considered a fringe figure in the race, but now the Republican party‚Äôs presumptive presidential nominee. Trump has been less than positive in his comments about China, asserting that the world‚Äôs number two economy had waged ‚Äúeconomic war‚Äù against the United States, and used crafty business practices to steal American jobs. China has largely refrained from responding to Trump‚Äôs barbs, but Finance Minister Lou Jiwei described him as ‚Äúan irrational type‚Äù in an interview in April.

Ohio legislature votes to allow limited medical marijuana use,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Ohio on Wednesday approved legislation that would legalize marijuana use for medical purposes under certain circumstances, less than a year after recreational marijuana use was soundly defeated by Ohio voters.   The bill, approved by both chambers of the state‚Äôs Republican-led legislature, heads to Republican Governor John Kasich for his signature as his office said on Wednesday that he will review the bill. During the last few years, state legislatures and voters in the United States have been much more receptive to making the use of marijuana legal for medical purposes than for recreational use.  Some 24 states and Washington D.C. currently allow some type of medical marijuana use while only a handful of states allow for recreational use. It remains illegal on the federal level.  The Ohio legislation is more limiting than some in that it only allows patients with specific medical conditions to use an oil, edible, tincture or vapor form of marijuana prescribed by a physician licensed in the state, starting in 2017.  ‚ÄúThis bill is not perfect, but it‚Äôs what Ohio patients need,‚Äù Ohio Senator Kenny Yuko, a Democrat, said before his house approved the bill.  ‚ÄúMarijuana is not a gateway drug, but a gateway off drugs.‚Äù Medical marijuana users would not be allowed to smoke or grow their own marijuana under the measure, which also would  create a commission responsible for regulating and licensing of all operations of the drug. In November, Ohio voters soundly rejected a measure that would have made it the first U.S. Midwestern state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Lawmakers from both parties voted for and against the bill on Wednesday. Some opponents of the measure have said that the qualifying list of medical conditions is too limited.  The measure was fast-tracked to head off a possible less-restrictive medical marijuana ballot initiative in November.  In a poll released in early May, 90 percent of Ohio voters supported the legalization for medical marijuana.  ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 "
Trump fires his national political director: campaign sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has fired his national political director after six weeks on the job, campaign sources said on Wednesday. Trump told staffers and supporters gathered backstage before a campaign rally in California on Wednesday that political director Rick Wiley ‚Äúshould be fired‚Äù for his handling of a fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee, according to the sources.  The RNC fundraising agreement included 11 states but not Nevada, where Republicans in the state are angling for key victories in the November elections. Three sources confirmed Trump said Wiley should be fired after Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald told Trump that Wiley was responsible for leaving Nevada out of the deal. McDonald did not return calls seeking comment. Wiley did not respond to emails, text messages and phone calls seeking comment. The move is the latest in a tug of war between Trump‚Äôs original campaign team, including press secretary Hope Hicks and  campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and a group of professionals he brought in later to shore up support from more traditional corners of the Republican Party. The new arrivals, led by veteran strategist Paul Manafort, whom Trump hired in late March, have urged Trump to tone down some of his most provocative positions, such as his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. But Trump reprimanded Manafort, according to two sources familiar with the conversation, after Manafort told a gathering of RNC members at an April meeting in Florida that Trump was only ‚Äúacting‚Äù when describing his proposed Muslim ban or his plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Manafort hired Wiley on April 13. A statement issued by the Trump campaign said Wiley had been hired on a ‚Äúshort-term basis as a consultant until the campaign was running full steam‚Äù and it thanked him for ‚Äúfor helping us during this transition period.‚Äù Manafort did not responds to calls and emails seeking comment.

Illinois House Democrats advance FY 2017 budget amid veto threat,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill (Reuters) - Illinois took another step on Wednesday that is bound to lead nowhere in solving its strangled finances, with the Democratic-led House approving a new spending plan and Republican Governor Bruce Rauner immediately vowing to veto it, saying it was $7 billion out of balance. The fiscal 2017 budget, which passed in a 63-53 vote, allocates $14.1 billion for general funds spending against $33 billion in anticipated revenue.  However, the Democrats‚Äô plan does not include billions of dollars the state automatically spends on pensions and debt payments, as well as for court-ordered social services spending under consent decrees, leading Republicans to blast the budget for needing $7.2 billion in additional revenue. The spending plan appeared destined to follow in the path of the Democrats‚Äô fiscal 2016 budget, which was vetoed by Rauner, with the exception of K-12 school funding, on the premise it was $4 billion short on revenue. That has left Illinois the only state without a complete spending plan 11 months into a fiscal year that began July 1, 2015. The state has been relying on ongoing appropriations, stopgap funding bills and court-ordered spending, with a growing pile of unpaid bills as it limps through the fiscal year. ‚ÄúThis is a repeat of last year on steroids,‚Äù said House Republican Leader Jim Durkin during the budget debate. But House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie said lawmakers must act to pass a budget.    ‚ÄúIt is unconscionable this state has failed to do its job during the current fiscal year and it would be even more unconscionable for us to leave this assembly without taking care of our responsibilities for the fiscal year to come,‚Äù she said. The House-passed budget includes an additional $700 million to address funding inequities among K-12 school districts, most notably the cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools, which would also get an additional $100 million for pensions. The budget now moves to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where its fate was unclear. Comptroller Leslie Munger, a Republican, warned of ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù results if the House budget plan is enacted, predicting the backlog of unpaid bills would more than double to $15 billion and payments to schools, hospitals and others would take as long as nine months to process.  A coalition of unpaid social service agencies that sued Illinois for more than $100 million earlier this month filed an emergency motion on Wednesday asking the Cook County Court to order the state to immediately make bill payments that are more than 60 days late.

Eight protesters arrested at Trump rally in California,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (Reuters) - Some 100 people staged a boisterous but largely peaceful demonstration outside a Southern California rally by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, at times taunting his supporters before police moved in and arrested eight people. The activists carried signs such as ‚ÄúStop Nazi Trump‚Äù and ‚ÄúDump Trump,‚Äù and beat a pinata made to resemble the presumptive Republican nominee outside a convention center in Anaheim, just a few blocks from Disneyland, before they were driven from the scene by police on horseback. A spokesman for the Anaheim Police Department said seven adults and one minor were arrested on charges ranging from selling T-shirts without a permit to unlawful assembly. The arrests came one day after a Trump event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, erupted into chaos after hundreds of protesters tried to swarm the convention center where Trump spoke, knocking down barricades, waving Mexican flags and hurling rocks and bottles at police officers in riot gear. Police responded with smoke bombs and pepper spray. Albuquerque police said they made arrests both outside and inside the rally, where demonstrators continually interrupted Trump‚Äôs speech. The police department‚Äôs Twitter feed said officers were treated for injuries caused by thrown rocks. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Trump called the protesters in Albuquerque ‚Äúthugs who were flying the Mexican flag.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!‚Äù he said. In Anaheim, police warned in advance that they would take ‚Äúswift‚Äù action if protests got out of hand, and the roughly 150 officers and sheriffs deputies on hand may have outnumbered the protesters.    Inside, Trump was interrupted by hecklers as he spoke, including one man who waved a Mexican flag. ‚ÄúDo not hurt him,‚Äù Trump said as a man was led out of the arena. ‚ÄúI say that for the television cameras. Even though he is a bad person.‚Äù  Many of those who protested outside the arena expressed anger over Trump‚Äôs views on immigration, at one point ripping apart a pi√±ata resembling the candidate and spearing the paper-mache head on top of a flagpole with a large Mexican flag. Police largely stood by watching the demonstration, which became tense at times when anti-Trump protesters surrounded smaller groups of his supporters. At one point a brief shoving match broke out.  As Trump‚Äôs campaign event neared its conclusion inside, outside a police helicopter circled overhead, ordering the throng to disperse or face arrest. Officers on horseback then drove the crowd from the scene, where several people were taken into custody for failing to disperse.  Trump‚Äôs appearances in the U.S. West in areas with significant Hispanic populations have drawn large protests in response to his remarks that Mexico is sending criminals and rapists to the United States, made when he launched his campaign last year. Trump‚Äôs problems with Latino voters could dampen his Nov. 8 election hopes. A poll by the political research group Latino Decisions found 87 percent of registered Hispanic voters view Trump unfavorably. States like Nevada and New Mexico have growing Hispanic populations that could tip the election. Trump‚Äôs trip west came ahead of the California and New Mexico nominating contests on June 7. He also plans to hold several large fundraising events in California. It is the first high-dollar fundraising event the New York real estate mogul has held after largely self-funding his primary campaign. Mike McGetrick, one of two people carrying ‚ÄúLatinos for Trump‚Äù signs at the Anaheim rally, said he is part of a group called America First Latinos, whose website describes its members as believing in ‚Äúthe rule of law, hard work and the American Dream.‚Äù He said his neighborhood in nearby Orange is ‚Äúbeing overrun‚Äù by undocumented immigrants. ‚ÄúThere are so many of them, and they‚Äôre everywhere,‚Äù said McGetrick, 62, a retired city worker. ‚ÄúI can tell an illegal from a regular person just like that.‚Äù Trump supporters have been hopeful that his likely opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, will be dogged by her own problems to offset his difficulty with some populations. On Wednesday, Clinton faced renewed criticism about her use of a private email server for government business while secretary of state after a report by the State Department‚Äôs inspector general said she had violated agency policies. Trump only briefly addressed the report in his appearance in Anaheim.  ‚ÄúNot good,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúInspector general‚Äôs report, not good.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
Chicago immigrant claims U.S. retaliated over her activism,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A Chicago activist sued U.S. immigration authorities on Wednesday alleging they denied renewal of her immigration status in retaliation for her political activity. Irere Unzueta, 29, who came to the United States from Mexico in 1994 when she was 6 years old, applied for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2013 and was granted immigration relief despite a history of arrests at demonstrations. But when she applied last year to renew her DACA status - which allows undocumented immigrants who entered the country before they were 16 to work legally and be exempt from deportation for a two-year period - it was denied. According to the lawsuit against the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency cited Unzueta‚Äôs civil disobedience in its explanation of the denial, saying that ‚ÄúMs. Unzueta‚Äôs case raised public safety concerns.‚Äù The denial ‚Äúpunishes her for engaging in constitutionally protected, peaceful political actions,‚Äù Mony Ruiz Velasco, a lawyer who represented Unzueta in her application for DACA, said at a news conference on Wednesday. Unzueta told reporters she has lost two job opportunities while fighting to renew her immigration status and said she brought the lawsuit because she is worried that hundreds of other students who spoke up about immigration issues could be targeted. She has never been convicted of any crime. The media office at USCIS said they do not comment on individual cases.  President Barack Obama initiated DACA in 2012, and then tried to expand it in 2014. The Supreme Court is considering challenges by a number of states to the expanded DACA and to a separate Obama program that would have granted immigration benefits to parents of children who are legally in the United States. The DACA designation is not a path to permanent resident status but has been controversial because Obama enacted it unilaterally. Unzueta and her family participated in a wave of campaigns around the country to push for DACA. She attended high school in Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2009.

States ratchet up transgender battle with lawsuit against U.S.,"(Reuters) - Officials from 11 U.S. states sued the Obama administration on Wednesday to overturn a directive telling schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity, decrying the policy as ‚Äúa massive social experiment.‚Äù Ramping up the simmering battles over contentious cultural issues in America, the states, led by Texas and most with Republican governors, accused the federal government of rewriting laws by ‚Äúadministrative fiat.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are willing to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to,‚Äù Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told reporters in Austin.  Amid a national debate on transgender rights, President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority. The states‚Äô lawsuit accused the federal government of overstepping its constitutional powers by taking actions that should be left to Congress or individual states. It also challenged the Obama administration‚Äôs interpretation of federal civil rights law with regard to sex and gender. The lawsuit said the administration ‚Äúconspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights.‚Äù Texas was joined by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus Arizona‚Äôs Department of Education and Maine‚Äôs governor. Paxton said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about parents who are upset, grandparents who are upset. They want to see that the safety of their children is taken care of.‚Äù Transgender rights advocates argued it is transgender people who need protection, particularly transgender women who are disproportionately the victims of assaults and would be forced to use men‚Äôs bathrooms if states succeed in forcing people to use bathrooms matching their sex at birth. Likewise, transgender men, many of whom grow facial hair, would be required to use women‚Äôs bathrooms along with girls. ‚ÄúThis action puts students at risk for the sake of politics,‚Äù said Alison Gill of the Trans United Fund advocacy group supporting transgender rights. Gill said the states‚Äô lawsuit did not reflect the position of most school boards and administrators. The administration‚Äôs letter to the schools said that to get federal funding under existing rules, schools must agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. That includes not treating transgender students differently from others of the same gender identity, officials said. Paul Castillo, a lawyer with Lambda Legal, which supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, said the lawsuit represented an ‚Äúunprecedented attack against transgender people across the United States.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese states are demonstrating the great lengths they will go to in order to discriminate against transgender individuals,‚Äù Castillo said. Nine of the 11 states that sued have Republican governors, including Maine‚Äôs Paul LePage. LePage broke with the Democratic attorney general, Janet Mills, who did not approve of the lawsuit, a spokesman for Mills said. School districts from Texas and Arizona also joined the suit, which names the U.S. government and a host of federal  agencies and officials as defendants. North Carolina sued the federal government on the transgender bathroom issue this month, seeking to protect its state law passed in March that bans people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. Ever since the 1960s civil rights movement, the federal government has asserted its authority to force states to extend equal protection under the law for all. The administration sued North Carolina on May 9, stating that its transgender bathroom law violated the U.S. 1964 Civil Rights Act. The 11 states‚Äô lawsuit accused the administration of taking that argument too far and improperly, widening the scope of interpretation of civil rights law. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The administration‚Äôs interpretation is that the word ‚Äúsex‚Äù extends protection to transgender people, but the issue has not been settled in the courts. ‚ÄúI agree with the Obama administration that ‚Äòsex‚Äô includes ‚Äògender,‚Äô and ‚Äògender‚Äô includes ‚Äògender identity,‚Äô‚Äù said John Pagan of the University of Richmond‚Äôs School of Law in Virginia. Peter Lake of Stetson University College of Law in Florida said the U.S. Supreme Court has taken a narrow view of the meaning of ‚Äúsex‚Äù under the law, but in recent years lower courts have been more likely to defer to the Obama administration‚Äôs broader definition. ‚ÄúMy sense is a certain momentum is building for broader protection of (LGBT) rights, and we might be seeing a moment of federal civil rights law in long-term transition,‚Äù Lake said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
"Clinton email server broke government rules, watchdog finds","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton broke government rules by using a private email server without approval for her work as U.S. secretary of state, an internal government watchdog said on Wednesday. The long-awaited report by the State Department inspector general was the first official audit of the controversial arrangement to be made public. It was highly critical of Clinton‚Äôs use of a server in her home, and immediately fueled Republican attacks on Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in an already acrimonious presidential race.  The report, which also found problems in department record-keeping practices before Clinton‚Äôs tenure, undermined Clinton‚Äôs earlier defenses of her emails, likely adding to Democratic anxieties about public perceptions of the candidate. A majority of voters say Clinton is dishonest, according to multiple polls.  The report concluded that Clinton would not have been allowed to use the server in her home had she asked the department officials in charge of information security. The report said that staff who later raised concerns were told to keep quiet. Several suspected hacking attempts in 2011 were never reported to department information security officials, in breach of department rules, it said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs as crooked as they come,‚Äù Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, said of Clinton at a campaign rally in Anaheim, California, adding that the report‚Äôs findings were ‚Äúnot good‚Äù for her. Clinton‚Äôs campaign disagreed, saying the report rebutted Republican‚Äôs criticism. The inspector general‚Äôs office examined email record-keeping under five secretaries state, both Democratic and Republican. John Kerry, the current officeholder, and predecessors Madeline Albright, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice all agreed to speak to the inspector general‚Äôs investigators. Clinton was the only one who declined to be interviewed, as did her aides. The report contradicted Clinton‚Äôs repeated assertion that her server was allowed and that no permission was needed.  Several other inquiries continue, including a U.S. Justice Department investigation into whether the arrangement broke laws. The inspector general‚Äôs report cited ‚Äúlongstanding, systemic weaknesses‚Äù with State Department records that predated Clinton‚Äôs tenure, and found problems with the email record-keeping of some of her predecessors, particularly Powell, that failed to comply with the Federal Records Act.  But it singled out Clinton for her decision to use a private server in her home in Chappaqua, New York, for government business. ‚ÄúOIG found no evidence that the Secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server,‚Äù the report said, using an abbreviation for the office of inspector general. The report said Clinton should have discussed the arrangement with the department‚Äôs security and technology officials. Officials told investigators that they ‚Äúdid not - and would not - approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business.‚Äù The reason, those officials said, is because it breached department rules and presented ‚Äúsecurity risks.‚Äù State Department spokesman Mark Toner said he would not ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù those findings. He told reporters the department was aware of hacking attempts on Clinton‚Äôs server, but had no evidence that any were successful.  When two lower-level information technology officials tried to raise concerns about Clinton‚Äôs email arrangement in late 2010, their supervisor in Clinton‚Äôs office instructed them ‚Äúnever to speak of the Secretary‚Äôs personal email system again,‚Äù the report said. Their supervisor told them that department lawyers had approved of the system, but the inspector general‚Äôs office said it found no evidence this was true. Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman, said the report rebutted criticisms of Clinton made by her political opponents. ‚ÄúThe report shows that problems with the State Department‚Äôs electronic recordkeeping systems were longstanding and that there was no precedent of someone in her position having a State Department email account until after the arrival of her successor,‚Äù he said in a statement. He did not address the report‚Äôs criticism of Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server, something no other secretary of state has done. Democrats, including fundraisers for Clinton‚Äôs campaign, said the report revealed nothing new. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs digging and digging and digging,‚Äù Amy Rao, the chief executive of data company Integrated Archive Systems and a Clinton fundraiser, said in an interview, comparing the investigation to probes the Clintons faced in the 1990s. ‚ÄúTrust me: There‚Äôs no there there. It‚Äôs Whitewater.‚Äù Current Secretary of State Kerry asked Steve Linick, the State Department inspector general, to investigate after Clinton‚Äôs email arrangement came to light last year. President Barack Obama appointed Linick to the role in 2013.  Republicans have used Clinton‚Äôs email practice to suggest she was trying to hide government records from scrutiny under public-access laws. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that the findings ‚Äúare just the latest chapter in the long saga of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs bad judgment that broke federal rules and endangered our national security.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
Puerto Rico rescue bill advances to full House vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday backed a plan to help Puerto Rico escape crippling debt and expand the economy, a move that could put a rescue before the House of Representatives within days. The House Natural Resources Committee endorsed the plan by a 29-10 vote and left intact most provisions endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. The plan would empower a federal oversight board to negotiate with investors and decide what they would recover from the roughly $70 billion they lent the island. Taxpayer money will not be spent in the rescue which would prevent a bailout, Ryan‚Äôs office said in a statement on Wednesday. Puerto Rico‚Äôs Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla praised the bill for elements to help address insolvency, protect essential services and grow the economy. However, he reiterated reservations about the broad power of the oversight board. ‚ÄúPuerto Ricans are Americans and our democratic rights need to be protected, just like those of American citizens living on the mainland, and the oversight provisions do not meet that obligation,‚Äù he said in a statement, urging Ryan to amend the bill before it goes to the full House for a vote.     Under the plan, investors may not sue Puerto Rico while the oversight board does its work, and all the island‚Äôs creditors could face a loss despite recent lobbying from Wall Street interest groups. Among Republicans who voted on Wednesday, more than half endorsed the rescue plan but a vocal minority warned that it would hurt investor demand for municipal bonds and force issuers to offer higher yields. ‚ÄúTaxpayers across the country will have to pay ... as markets adjust to this new world,‚Äù warned Congressman Tom McClintock of California. The bill, called the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, passed without significant changes. Speaker Ryan and Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, in separate statements on Wednesday touted bipartisan support for the bill. If that holds, lawmakers may guide the rescue past the Senate to President Barack Obama before $1.9 billion in Puerto Rico debt is due on July 1. Republicans may demand more concessions while some Democrats find the oversight board too punitive. Democrats also want guarantees that the island‚Äôs pension system, which has a shortfall of $40 billion, would be protected first. With the House and Senate set to begin a week-long Memorial Day holiday break at the end of this week, debate of the bill by the full House is not expected until sometime in June.

'Little House' star drops bid for U.S. congressional seat,"(Reuters) - Melissa Gilbert, best known for playing Laura Ingalls Wilder in the 1970s television drama ‚ÄúLittle House on the Prairie,‚Äù has dropped out of the race for a U.S. congressional seat in Michigan for medical reasons.  Gilbert, 52, said continued problems from neck and back injuries from a 2012 accident forced her to give up her Democratic candidacy for the Republican-held seat. ‚ÄúWhile I have received the best treatment and therapy I could have asked for, those injuries have only gotten worse,‚Äù Gilbert said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs much as it breaks my heart to say this, my doctors have told me I am physically unable to continue my run for Congress.‚Äù Gilbert, who lives with her husband, actor Timothy Busfield, in Howell, Michigan, about 60 miles (100 km) from Detroit, has no political background but served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild from 2001 to 2005.

"Funding battle begins with House bill on regulators, agencies","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The first shots in a political battle over funding for a range of federal activities rang out during a congressional subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, as Republicans and Democrats took opposing stances on a budget bill for financial regulators and other agencies. The legislation, which covers funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury Department, the judiciary branch and others, passed the House of Representatives Financial Services Subcommittee and now goes to the full Appropriations Committee. It then must win approval from the Republican-dominated House before being reconciled with a Senate version into a single bill for President Barack Obama to sign. Democrats at Wednesday‚Äôs meeting made it clear they will press for changes at every step of the lawmaking process, saying the current bill is loaded with ideological policy ‚Äúriders‚Äù that do not belong and that it could cripple important government work. Republicans, meanwhile, said the bill would reign in spending, make bodies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau more accountable and boost funding for important issues. ‚ÄúWe cut funding for nearly two dozen agencies that can operate with a little less,‚Äù said Republican Ander Crenshaw of Florida, the subcommittee chairman, adding that the cuts helped free up more money for antidrug trafficking efforts, the Small Business Administration, and the Treasury Department‚Äôs Offfice of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. In total, the bill drops funding by 6.5 percent from current levels for all agencies, including the General Services Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, which bear ‚Äúthe brunt of the reduction‚Äù because ‚Äúthey are the largest agencies in the bill and both have a recent history of inappropriate behavior,‚Äù Crenshaw said. Republicans want to shake up the IRS after a 2013 scandal in which it allegedly targeted conservative Tea Party groups. The bill would also shave $50 million from the SEC‚Äôs budget. Representative Nita Lowey, a Democrat from New York, said the lower funding in the legislation ‚Äúwould allow more tax cheats to go undetected‚Äù and thwart the SEC in protecting investors.  ‚ÄúThe long list of riders turns a bad bill into an example of the Republican majority‚Äôs unnecessary culture war,‚Äù she added, citing provisions to block the Federal Communications Commission‚Äôs internet neutrality rule and to limit health coverage of abortions for federal employees. Calling the riders ‚Äúunnecessary, unwarranted, and unhelpful,‚Äù  the senior Democrat on the subcommittee, Jose Serrano of New York, said ‚Äúthey are an effort to appease the right wing of the right wing.‚Äù¬†  ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
House Speaker Ryan says he hasn't decided on Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, on Wednesday continued to withhold his support from Donald Trump for the Republican Party‚Äôs presidential nomination, saying he is not ready to endorse the real estate billionaire, a political neophyte. Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, brushed aside reports that he was ready to endorse Trump during a meeting with reporters in the Capitol. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt made a decision,‚Äù he said, adding that he had no timetable for doing so. The 46-year-old speaker is the only member of the Republican congressional leadership who has not formally embraced the presumptive Republican nominee. Ryan is expected to chair the party‚Äôs nominating convention in July in Cleveland. Ryan and Trump were, however, scheduled to speak by telephone on Wednesday evening, a spokesman for Ryan said. ‚ÄúThis is not an endorsement call,‚Äù spokesman Zack Roday said. Ryan set up the call with Trump to continue discussing the party‚Äôs campaign agenda, a Ryan aide said. Trump‚Äôs ascent has shaken the party establishment and raised concerns among some Republicans over whether they can unify behind him, given his harsh rhetoric and shifting policy positions in a brutal primary fight that once had 17 candidates. Ryan was asked Wednesday about Trump‚Äôs comment this week that New Mexico Republican Governor Susana Martinez, who had declined to attend a Trump rally, was not doing her job.  Ryan said Martinez was a ‚Äúgreat governor‚Äù and ‚Äúa friend of mine,‚Äù and said he would leave it at that. Ryan said his staff and Trump‚Äôs were in contact virtually daily. ‚ÄúI want this to be a sincere deliberative process,‚Äù Ryan said. He dismissed suggestions that the Trump campaign was trying to pressure him, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt worry about that stuff.‚Äù The speaker faces some pressure from inside his party to smooth things over and form a united front against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November. Ryan‚Äôs statement earlier this month that he was not ready to support Trump was unusual and seen as an effort to keep some distance from Trump and protect Ryan‚Äôs own presidential prospects for 2020. Ryan said his staff and the Trump campaign have been discussing a wide-ranging policy agenda for the campaign, covering issues from healthcare to taxes and national security. Ryan said the policy agenda on poverty will be announced in the first week of June, with more details later in the month. He said the agenda was for 2017 and would feature ‚Äúthe kind of things that you can get done only with a Republican president.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
"Trump, aiming to offset money disadvantage, escalates Clinton attacks","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump this week took his use of sordid accusations against Democrat Hillary Clinton to levels unprecedented in modern U.S. presidential campaigns, in the latest example of the Republican‚Äôs unorthodox playbook. The presumptive Republican nominee is working to gain stronger footing and offset a big advantage Clinton is likely to have ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election: a huge campaign war chest that she and her allies intend to use to launch a barrage of attacks against him.  Trump is using the same strategy he used repeatedly during the Republican nomination fight against rivals like Ted Cruz: making incendiary statements that U.S. television networks cannot resist covering, giving him hours of free media and putting his opponents on the defensive.  The strategy may already be working. Trump has raised more than a few eyebrows with his latest round of attacks against Clinton. He has turned history into headlines that play like a virtual reel in the 24-hour news world of cable TV and the internet. Trump‚Äôs campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said the strategy makes sense. ‚ÄúClearly, she‚Äôs going to have massive amounts of money,‚Äù Lewandowski told Reuters. ‚ÄúThe difference is Mr. Trump has funded his campaign. What we‚Äôve been able to do in this campaign cycle is to generate earned media based on Mr. Trump‚Äôs ability to be a straight talker, and genuine and authentic, and I think that‚Äôs what drives the news cycle.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs latest salvos include a rape accusation against former President Bill Clinton dating to the 1970s and the suicide of an aide to the former president in 1993 - events that the campaign links to Hillary Clinton. An online video released by Trump has various women accusing the former president of rape or unwanted sexual advances. Trump accused Hillary Clinton of helping to silence the women. The Clintons and their supporters have dismissed the charges as baseless and politically motivated. Then, in an interview with The Washington Post, Trump suggested that the Clintons may have been involved in the 1993 death of Vince Foster, a former aide to Bill Clinton and a friend of Hillary Clinton, even though more than five investigations, including one conducted by Republican special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, concluded that Foster committed suicide in a Virginia park. Trump was alluding to theories over the years that have been circulated in tabloid publications, in the depths of the internet and in books by the Clintons‚Äô foes. On Wednesday, Trump‚Äôs campaign accidentally sent an email to a reporter at Politico revealing that the Republican plans to next attack Clinton regarding Whitewater, a real estate scandal that plagued Bill Clinton‚Äôs administration. No wrongdoing by the Clintons was ever proven. The attacks have put Hillary Clinton on her back foot. Trump ‚Äújust continues to gobble news cycle after news cycle,‚Äù said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, who ran the Super PACs that backed Senator Ted Cruz in the primary and aggressively attacked Trump. ‚ÄúClinton is spending less time campaigning about the future and more time explaining the past than she would probably like.‚Äù  The barrage puts Clinton in a bind. So far, she has opted to ignore Trump‚Äôs personal attacks and her campaign has offered general pushback. But Clinton risks the negative onslaught dragging down her standing with the public and irreversibly damaging her general election hopes. ‚ÄúI played a lot of hardball in my life, but I don‚Äôt envy what the Clinton campaign is up against here. Trump himself has totally changed the political dynamic,‚Äù said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who supports Clinton. ‚ÄúWhat they can‚Äôt afford to do is get in the gutter with the guy. He has absolutely no morals or scruples. Getting into the gutter with him is an absolute waste of time.‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs campaign and the Super PACs supporting her will not be without funds to try to combat the attacks and launch her own. At the end of April, she had $30 million in her campaign account, compared with Trump‚Äôs $2 million.  And the PAC supporting her, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, had $46 million at the end of April - a total that is likely to grow over the summer. The PAC backing Trump is just getting off the ground. Clinton will also depend on an army of surrogates to try to combat Trump without having to respond to him herself.  Trump has already proven he can dispatch opponents without spending much money by defining them to voters through aggressive appearances on news programs.  Republican rival Jeb Bush had a more than $100 million advantage going into the primary. But Trump painted him as ‚Äúlow energy‚Äù and defined him as inept, a characterization Bush‚Äôs money was never able to overcome. The PACs backing Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz spent millions assailing Trump. Trump was able to leverage extensive coverage of his campaign by the media to combat their attacks while spending little money on advertising. Trump has been proven an expert at raising attack lines that have already been settled, but insisting that questions remain. He spent years demanding that President Barack Obama produce his birth certificate, despite myriad evidence that Obama was born in Hawaii, including government records of the president‚Äôs birth in Honolulu. For Trump, some of the attacks are targeted at young voters - those in their early 20s and 30s were too young to have been immersed in news about the scandals of the Clinton years.   ‚ÄúYou have a whole series of the population who either (a) don‚Äôt know anything about it, or (b) weren‚Äôt paying attention at the time,‚Äù Lewandowski said. A Clinton ally said Trump is simply trying to distract attention from his own liabilities - such as refusing to release his tax returns and his own history of problems with women. ‚ÄúThe more he raises these outrageous and outlandish charges,‚Äù said U.S. Representative Xavier Becerra, of California, a Democratic leader in the House, ‚Äúthe more he keeps you pedaling in a different direction.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "

Obama administration officials warn lawmakers over Iran sanctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Obama administration officials told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday they would oppose new sanctions on Iran if they interfere with last year‚Äôs international nuclear agreement, laying the groundwork for a potential fight over any legislation. ‚ÄúIf legislation were to undermine the deal, by taking off the table commitments that we had put on the table, that would be a problem,‚Äù Adam Szubin, the acting Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told a House of Representatives hearing. ‚ÄúCertainly our allies around the world would see us taking back major chunks of the sanctions relief as bad faith,‚Äù Szubin told a Senate Banking Committee hearing later on Wednesday. House and Senate members are drafting new sanctions measures, accusing Iran of supporting terrorism, human rights abuses and violating its international commitments by testing ballistic missiles. They want to renew the Iran Sanctions Act, a broad U.S. law imposing sanctions over Iran‚Äôs nuclear and missile programs that expires at the end of 2016. Administration officials have urged Congress not to rush to renew the ISA. Lawmakers argue that new sanctions will help send a message that Washington will take a hard line, despite the nuclear pact. Every Republican in Congress and several of President Barack Obama‚Äôs fellow Democrats opposed the agreement. ‚ÄúI feel it‚Äôs not so terrible to have Congress come up with new sanctions if we feel Iran is violating its agreements,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who opposed the nuclear pact. Szubin and Stephen Mull, the State Department‚Äôs lead coordinator for implementing the nuclear deal, told lawmakers that, so far, the deal announced in July 2015 was being fully implemented. They said the administration was tightly tracking Iran‚Äôs compliance. ‚ÄúWe believe that we and our allies in the region are considerably safer,‚Äù Mull said.  Members of Congress recently accused the administration of allowing sanctions workarounds that might provide Iran direct or indirect access to the U.S. financial system. Szubin reiterated the administration‚Äôs assurances that it had no such plans. Despite the easing of nuclear sanctions under the international agreement, Tehran‚Äôs hopes of rapidly ending its economic isolation have been complicated by companies‚Äô concerns that doing business with Iran might violate non-nuclear sanctions that remain in place.

Congress moves to revamp toxic chemical law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation with bipartisan support that would revamp U.S. chemical safety law for the first time in decades is advancing in Congress, winning overwhelming passage in the House of Representatives as backers sought quick Senate action. Senate leadership aides said the timing was still being worked out for a Senate vote on the first update of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in about 40 years. The House‚Äôs 403-12 vote to pass the measure updating the regulation of toxic chemicals aided the bill‚Äôs chances, with the Senate also expected to strongly embrace the bill, according to leadership aides. ‚ÄúBy removing 40-year-old barriers and modernizing procedures, we reduce the risk to consumers. This means the chemicals and products we use every day will be safer for Americans,‚Äù Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Lawmakers have complained that under current law, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been unable to effectively regulate chemicals, including those that can be found in hardware stores for home improvements. ‚ÄúUnder current law, it‚Äôs become harder for the EPA to ban even substances that are known to cause cancer, such as asbestos,‚Äù said Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, in calling for passage of the bill on Tuesday. According to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, ‚ÄúAbsent EPA action under TSCA, some states, litigants and even consumer product retailers have been increasingly taking steps to restrict certain chemicals, not always relying on objective scientific analysis to make these decisions.‚Äù Under the bill, the government would evaluate risks posed by chemicals without considering the cost of taking action. If there are indications that a chemical‚Äôs use presents an unreasonable risk, the EPA would attempt to manage the risk, under the bill. Steps could range from labeling the product to banning it. Under the compromise bill hammered out by Republicans and Democrats, the EPA would have to consider the impact of a chemical on health and the environment, the chemical‚Äôs benefits and the economic impact of regulation.

Senators urge House to move on aviation security bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top members of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have urged their counterparts in the House of Representatives to move forward on Senate legislation to boost aviation security and authorize the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration. In a May 24 letter released on Wednesday, the senate panel‚Äôs Republican chairman, John Thune of South Dakota, and its top Democrat, Bill Nelson of Florida, cautioned House lawmakers that Congress has only six weeks left to approve legislation before a temporary FAA funding patch expires in mid-July. The letter, addressed to House Transportation Chairman Bill Schuster of Pennsylvania and that panel‚Äôs top Democrat, Peter DeFazio of Oregon, urged movement on a Senate bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support last month. ‚ÄúWe believe that this legislation represents a model for House action, which is essential to avoiding another round of funding extensions that will be disruptive to the aviation industry and only delay much-needed reforms,‚Äù Thune and Nelson said.  House lawmakers have not taken up the Senate bill but have focused instead on their own multi-year measure that stalled due to disagreement over a controversial plan to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system.

But DeFazio said he agreed with the senators about the need to move forward.  ‚ÄúWe could pass comprehensive legislation with broad bipartisan support today if the Republicans drop their divisive scheme to privatize air traffic control,‚Äù the Oregon Democrat said in a statement issued by his office.   Thune and Nelson described the Senate bill as ‚Äúthe only viable opportunity this year‚Äù to deliver comprehensive legislation to President Barack Obama for his signature.

Protesters chanted anti-Trump slogans, held anti-Trump signs and waved Mexican flags before the demonstration descended into chaos with some protesters standing on top of police cars.   Television footage showed officers responding by using pepper spray and smoke bombs to disperse the crowd. Police said they made arrests both outside and inside the rally, where protesters continually interrupted Trump‚Äôs speech.  No one at the police department was immediately available for comment. Protests have become common outside rallies for Trump, the party‚Äôs presumptive nominee, who has polarized opinion with his rhetoric against illegal immigration. He abandoned a rally in Chicago in March after clashes between his supporters and protesters. He has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists across the U.S. border and has promised to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. According to CNN, his supporters chanted ‚Äúbuild that wall‚Äù during his rally on Tuesday in Albuquerque where a little less than half of the population is Hispanic or Latino.     ‚ÄúWatching thugs (and) punks in Albuquerque - en route to California. They don‚Äôt even know what they are protesting,‚Äù Trump aide Dan Scavino said on Twitter.  Trump heads on Wednesday to a rally in Anaheim, California, which has a growing Latino minority.

Obama to Asians worried about U.S. election: It's going to be OK,"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama sought on Wednesday to ease growing Asian worries about the raucous election campaign to succeed him which has been dominated by the incendiary rhetoric of  mogul Donald Trump, now the Republican Party‚Äôs nominee. ‚ÄúI think other people sometimes look at our election system and say ‚Äòwhat a mess‚Äô,‚Äù Obama told a townhall meeting with young leaders in Vietnam‚Äôs Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. ‚ÄúBut usually we end up doing okay because the American people are good people ... Sometimes our politics doesn‚Äôt express all the goodness of the people,‚Äù he said, without referring specifically to any of the presidential candidates. Obama made the comments just before ending a three-day trip to Vietnam, whose high point was an announcement that Washington‚Äôs ban on sales of lethal weapons to the country - a vestige of the Vietnam War - would be completely lifted. Obama repeatedly insisted that lifting the embargo was not a response to Beijing‚Äôs assertiveness in the South China Sea.  Critics accused Washington of throwing away a powerful lever it had to press communist-ruled Vietnam for improvements in human rights. White House officials say the arms move was a natural step to take with a country that, once an enemy, is now a key part of Obama‚Äôs strategic ‚Äòrebalance‚Äô towards Asia and an important trade partner as its economy grows apace. Obama also announced the Peace Corps would begin operating in Vietnam for the first time. Across Asia, policymakers have been startled by Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúisolationist‚Äù foreign policy pronouncements, which have challenged much of the status quo in Washington‚Äôs relations with the region. Many fear Trump will feed insecurity in nations worried about China‚Äôs growing power, embolden nationalists and authoritarians, and unravel Obama‚Äôs ‚Äòpivot‚Äô to the Asia-Pacific. At the townhall in Ho Chi Minh City, a young woman who had been an exchange student in Montana asked Obama what he thought of the prospects that Trump or Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders following him to the White House. ‚ÄúUsually, eventually the voters make good decisions and democracy works,‚Äù replied Obama, whose criticism of Trump has sharpened since he all but clinched the Republican nomination. ‚ÄúThings are going to be ok. I promise.‚Äù Thousands of people lined the streets of Ho Chi Minh City for a second day to cheer enthusiastically and wave mini-flags of Vietnam and the United States as Obama drove by on his way to the airport for a flight to Japan.  At his freewheeling townhall, where he was greeted with a standing ovation, Obama noted that two-thirds of the country‚Äôs population were born after 1975, when the war ended with North Vietnamese tanks rolling into Saigon to bring U.S.-backed South Vietnam under communist rule. Obama prodded Vietnam‚Äôs leaders on political freedoms during his visit after critics of the government were prevented from meeting him. When a woman rapper at the townhall asked him¬†about supporting arts and culture, he segued into an appeal for people to be allowed to express themselves. However, his unusually long one-country visit was warm and mostly about strengthening diplomatic and economic relations. Annual U.S.-Vietnam trade has swelled from $450 million when ties were normalized in 1995 to $45 billion last year. Washington is a big buyer of Vietnam‚Äôs televisions, smartphones, clothing and seafood. Obama repeatedly touted the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, of which export-led Vietnam will be one of the biggest beneficiaries, if it survives opponents in Washington concerned about competition and a loss of U.S. jobs. He also talked about the challenges of climate change when asked about the drying-up of the Mekong River in the rice-bowl delta of southern Vietnam, urging Southeast Asian countries to work together. The Mekong River, which sustains 60 million livelihoods as it flows through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, is under threat from at least 39 hydro-electric dams being built or under development upstream of Vietnam, most of them in China. Low river levels have allowed seawater to penetrate inland, ruining vast swathes of cropland in the fertile delta. Obama did not name any of the upstream countries but said the United States would provide smaller member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with technical assistance and evaluations of what needs to be done. ‚ÄúHopefully ... that information can be used to negotiate on an international level to try to prevent some projects that might have very bad effects,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne of the things that we‚Äôve seen in ASEAN is that when small countries band together as a unit, then the power magnifies.‚Äù   Japan is the final stop on Obama‚Äôs swing through Asia, where he is attending a summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations starting Thursday.

"Trump advisers push him to target OPEC, regulations in big energy speech","WILLISTON, North Dakota (Reuters) - Two energy advisers to Donald Trump want him to call out members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for driving down world oil prices when he delivers a major energy policy speech this week.  The advisers, who said they had been asked by Trump‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign to contribute ideas for the speech, told Reuters they had also suggested he mention cuts to regulations and a streamlining of the federal tax code to make U.S. energy companies more competitive. The advisers, U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and another who asked not to be identified, said they had urged Trump to criticize the OPEC cartel for contributing to a crash in world oil prices by producing full throttle, a factor that has helped push many U.S. oil companies into bankruptcy. ‚ÄúWe have to look at the global playing field and see which of our partners - OPEC, Iran, Russia - are playing fair in the global marketplace,‚Äù Cramer said about the advice he had been giving Trump. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not shied from targeting OPEC‚Äôs top producer, Saudi Arabia, in the past. He has said the United States should consider halting oil purchases from the kingdom if it does not provide troops to fight Islamic State militants who control swaths of Syria and Iraq. Trump‚Äôs speech on Thursday at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in North Dakota, the heart of U.S. drilling country that has been hard hit by the oil price slump, may reveal for the first time how he will approach the energy sector if elected. A spokeswoman for Trump‚Äôs campaign declined requests for comment and it was unclear whether Trump would use any the ideas provided by the advisers.      Trump has so far been mostly mute on details of his energy policy. He has dismissed climate change as a hoax, promised to renegotiate the U.N. global climate accord, and vowed a revival in the U.S. coal industry, which has been hobbled by low prices and rules that limit pollution emissions.   Environmental advocates and Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, have criticized his stance for underplaying the economic and social risks of climate change. Cramer, who cosponsored a bipartisan bill to investigate OPEC‚Äôs influence in the oil market, said Trump should examine Saudi and Venezuelan ownership stakes in U.S. refineries that import foreign oil instead of using domestic supply, if he is elected president.  ‚ÄúOne-third of (U.S.) refining capacity is owned by OPEC countries. How does this fit into (Trump‚Äôs) America first policy?‚Äù Cramer said. Cramer‚Äôs suggestions, and those of the second adviser Reuters interviewed, have been sent to Trump senior policy advisers including John Mashburn, who is expected to help draft Trump‚Äôs speech, according to sources familiar with the campaign. Mashburn could not be reached for comment. The organizer of Thursday‚Äôs conference, North Dakota Petroleum Council President Ron Ness, said 7,700 people were expected to attend, many probably hoping for assurances from Trump that he will help the oil industry be more competitive.  ‚ÄúWe can manage the cyclical nature of the market but what we are struggling with is the daily onslaught of punitive regulations,‚Äù he said.    Cramer has suggested to Trump that he ease regulations like the Clean Power Plan, which is aimed at curbing emissions scientists believe contribute to global warming. He also wants Trump to consider the scope of waterways protected under the Clean Water Act. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
Tennis: Halep keeps her wits to reach round three,"PARIS (Reuters) - Former finalist Simona Halep survived a first-set wobble to reach the third round of the French Open for only the second time in her career with a 7-6(5) 6-2 win over Kazakhstan‚Äôs Zarina Diyas on Wednesday.  The Romanian sixth seed surrendered her serve twice in the opening four games to trail 4-1 but delved into her wealth of experience to finally subdue her 90th-ranked opponent 7-5 in the tie break. More exchanges of breaks followed in the second set before Halep finally found her groove to take a 5-2 lead and set up three match points on Diyas‚Äô serve. The first one went begging but Halep‚Äôs gritty baseline play paid off in the next point as Diyas bowed out after flicking a forehand long to end a 10-shot rally. ‚ÄúThe first set was very tough and I was very nervous as I seemed to be fighting for every point,‚Äù Halep said in a court side interview. The good news for Halep is that the only previous time she reached the last 32, she made it all the way to the 2014 Roland Garros final. Halep and her bizarre black and white zebra print dress will be back on court on Friday when she takes on Japan‚Äôs Naomi Osaka for a place in the fourth round. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
Pro-EU group unveils Soviet-style mural of Trump kissing ex-Mayor Johnson,"LONDON (Reuters) - A giant mural of Donald Trump locked in a kiss with former London mayor Boris Johnson in the style of a legendary Soviet-era image has been unveiled by a group campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union. Painted on the side of a building in Bristol, southwest England - home of the celebrated graffiti artist Banksy - the image reprises a 1979 photograph of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and East German President Erich Honecker kissing, which was later turned into a mural on the Berlin Wall.  It was commissioned by pro-EU campaign group ‚ÄúWe are Europe‚Äù as what they call a warning of things to come if Britons vote to leave the 28-member bloc on June 23, as advocated by both Johnson and Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate in November‚Äôs U.S. presidential election. Johnson is the ‚ÄúOut‚Äù campaign‚Äôs best-known leader and Trump has said Britain would be ‚Äúbetter off without‚Äù the EU, which he has blamed for Europe‚Äôs migration crisis. The 15-foot (4.5 meter) mural is accompanied by the slogan ‚ÄúNot #IN for this?‚Äù and a plea for people, especially the young, to register to vote by a June 7 deadline. ‚ÄúPeople need to look at this image and think - is this the future I want,‚Äù said Harriet Kingaby, a spokesperson from We Are Europe. Galvanizing the youth vote is a key issue for the ‚ÄúIn‚Äù camp. Surveys show young people are far more likely to be in favor of remaining in the EU but also much less likely to bother to vote. A survey of 2,000 students this month found that 63 percent did not know the exact date of the referendum, while 54 percent were not aware it was being held in June. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
Trump unlikely to be able to renegotiate climate deal: U.N. climate chief,"COLOGNE (Reuters) - Donald Trump would be ‚Äúhighly unlikely‚Äù to be able to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected U.S. president, the U.N.‚Äôs climate chief said on Wednesday, as doing so would require the agreement of 195 countries.  Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told Reuters earlier this month he was ‚Äúnot a big fan‚Äù of the climate accord and would seek to renegotiate elements of the deal. ‚ÄúAs we all know, Donald Trump relishes making very dramatic statements on many issues, so it is not surprising, but it is highly unlikely that that would be possible,‚Äù Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, told journalists at the Carbon Expo event in Cologne. The accord, struck in Paris last December, saw countries agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 with the aim of limiting the rise in the global average temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius. ‚ÄúAn agreement that has been adopted by 195 countries would require 195 countries to agree to any new negotiation,‚Äù she said. She added the current U.S. administration was a strong supporter of the deal because it benefits the country. Many of the accord‚Äôs backers say it is in U.S. interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions, partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels would also mean less air pollution, a big cause of disease.  Trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business. The Paris Agreement will formally enter into force when 55 nations representing at least 55 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it. China and the United States, representing 38 percent, say they will join this year. Figueres said if this happens the agreement could come into force as early as 2017. It would then be even harder for the U.S. to pull out, as rules state any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of the agreement‚Äôs entry into force - the length of a U.S. presidential term.

Democratic presidential candidate Sanders seeks recount in Kentucky,"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Tuesday requested a recount in the close Kentucky presidential primary against front-runner Hillary Clinton, state election officials said on Tuesday. The recanvass will take place at all 120 county boards of election on Thursday, according to the Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Grimes. Clinton won Kentucky by just 1,924 votes, according to the unofficial totals posted on the secretary of state‚Äôs elections page. She won Jefferson County, which includes Louisville and is the largest by far of the state‚Äôs 120 counties, by nearly 10 times that amount In his filing on Tuesday, Sanders requested a full check and recount of every voting machine and absentee ballot from all precincts in the counties, according to Grimes‚Äô website. ‚ÄúMy office is notifying all county boards of elections that Sen. Sanders has requested a recanvass, and we are reminding them of the laws and procedures to be followed,‚Äù Grimes said in a statement. Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, narrowly defeated Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, in the May 17 presidential nominating contest in Kentucky, a state she had not been expected to win.  A Sanders campaign representative said the recount request was important for the integrity of the Democratic presidential contest, in which Sanders is continuing to challenge Clinton despite her formidable lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the nomination. ‚ÄúI think the point is just transparency, it‚Äôs not just about Kentucky,‚Äù Sanders aide Larry Cohen said on CNN. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about trying to create a context, now and at the (Democratic) convention, that these primaries and caucuses need transparency, they need to be authentic, they need to build confidence among voters, particularly younger voters, that this is not rigged.‚Äù  Sanders has generally drawn more support from young voters than Clinton.

Obama prods Vietnam on rights after activists stopped from meeting him,"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama chided Vietnam on political freedoms on Tuesday after critics of its communist-run government were prevented from meeting him in Hanoi, a discordant note on a trip otherwise steeped in amity between the former foes. Tens of thousands turned out to welcome Obama on the second leg of his visit, Ho Chi Minh City, which was called Saigon until April 1975 when North Vietnamese tanks rolled in to bring U.S.-backed South Vietnam under communist rule. Many in the crowds lining the streets chanted ‚ÄúObama, Obama,‚Äù some held handwritten signs reading ‚ÄúObama, we love you,‚Äù and one woman held a boy dressed in a Captain America costume, complete with shield. Underlining the importance of the growing economic ties between the countries, Obama held an open forum with young  entrepreneurs and laid out the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact between 12 Pacific Rim countries. The high point of his visit came on Monday, with an announcement that Washington was scrapping its embargo on the sale of lethal arms to Vietnam. That clears the biggest hurdle remaining between two countries drawn together by concern over China‚Äôs military build-up. Critics said that by removing the ban, a vestige of the Vietnam War, Washington had put concerns about Beijing‚Äôs assertiveness in the South China Sea first and given up a critical lever to press Hanoi for improvements in human rights. One prominent intellectual, Nguyen Quang A, told Reuters that about 10 policemen had come to his house at 6:30 a.m. and put him in a car that was driven out of the capital until Obama was about to leave. An outspoken lawyer, Ha Huy Son, said he was also stopped from joining Obama‚Äôs meeting with six other civil society leaders. Human Rights Watch said a journalist who was also invited had been arrested on Monday. Quang A, a former IT entrepreneur, was one of more than 100 Vietnamese who tried to run as independents for last weekend‚Äôs election to the parliament, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party. Almost all failed to get on the ballot. Before he was taken away, Quang A posted on Facebook a photograph of himself dressing for the meeting with Obama, with the message: ‚ÄúBefore going. May be intercepted, arrested. Advising so people know.‚Äù Vietnam‚Äôs foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Obama noted that several activists had been blocked from meeting him and said this was an indication that, despite some ‚Äúmodest‚Äù legal reforms ‚Äúthere are still folks who find it very difficult to assemble and organize peacefully around issues that they care deeply about.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are still areas of significant concern in terms of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, accountability with respect to government,‚Äù he said. U.S. officials said that lifting the arms embargo would make it easier for Washington to engage with Vietnam on such issues. In Washington, members of the U.S. Congress, including Republicans as well as some of Obama‚Äôs fellow Democrats, criticized the policy shift alongside about a dozen Vietnamese human rights activists. ‚ÄúThis is the definition of a bad deal,‚Äù Republican Representative Chris Smith said at a news conference. ‚ÄúThis is not smart diplomacy, it is surrender of U.S. interests and values.‚Äù Democratic Representative Adam Lowenthal said, ‚ÄúI am very disappointed that we lost yet another opportunity to elicit any kind of commitment from the Vietnamese government on improving the human rights of the Vietnamese people.‚Äù  In a speech before leaving Hanoi, Obama stressed the importance of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, where China has been turning remote outcrops into islands with runways and harbors. ‚ÄúBig nations should not bully small ones. Disputes should be resolved peacefully,‚Äù he said, without naming China, which claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said the decision to lift the embargo showed a willingness to relax standards on human rights for the sake of containing China. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in Ho Chi Minh City with Obama, told reporters that Washington‚Äôs efforts to normalize relations with Vietnam were not aimed at China. ‚ÄúThis is not about China. Nothing that we did here or (are) arguing here is focused on China. It is focused on the fastest-growing marketplace in the world,‚Äù Kerry said.  Obama interviewed three entrepreneurs at Ho Chi Minh City‚Äôs ‚ÄúDreamplex,‚Äù which hosts budget tech start-ups with support of angel investors and Silicon Valley funds. He also touted the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, especially for unlocking entrepreneurial innovation. Vietnam‚Äôs manufacturing and export-led economy is seen as the biggest TPP beneficiary. Annual U.S.-Vietnam trade swelled to $45 billion last year from $450 million when ties were normalized. Washington is a big buyer of Vietnam‚Äôs televisions, smartphones, clothing and seafood. But the TPP, which would remove tariffs across a 12-nation bloc worth a combined $28 trillion of gross domestic product, is not a done deal. Opposition is expected in Washington amid concern about competition and a loss of U.S. jobs. ",politicsNews,"May 23, 2016 "
Clinton knocks Trump for cheering housing bubble burst,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton, seeking to dampen Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs growing appeal with working-class voters, on Tuesday accused him of having cheered on the 2008 housing market crash. Clinton‚Äôs campaign released an ad with audio that the presumptive Republican nominee recorded in 2006 for his now-defunct Trump University venture. Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, in remarks on a ‚Äúbubble burst,‚Äù said: ‚ÄúI sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy‚Äù property and ‚Äúmake a lot of money.‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs campaign and her surrogates used the recording to argue that she would take better care of the U.S. economy. Clinton is seeking to blunt the inroads that Trump has been making with voters in crucial states such as Florida and Ohio. Trump defended his comments on Tuesday evening at a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, saying buying when the housing market was down showed smart dealmaking skills that he would bring to the White House. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a businessman, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm supposed to do,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI feel badly for everybody. What am I going to do? I‚Äôm in business.‚Äù The New Yorker also impersonated Clinton on the campaign trail, who he said ‚Äúscreams,‚Äù and said other big names in business did similar deals as he did before the housing crisis. Trump has never held elected office and often touts his history as a businessman in response to accusations that he is unprepared to assume the presidency. Anti-Trump protestors and police clashed outside the Albuquerque convention center on Tuesday when protestors tried to storm the center, calling for an end to the Trump rally. Albuquerque police said on Twitter that protestors threw rocks and bottles and a door to the facility appeared to have been hit with something. Police said the only arrests so far had been inside the rally, where Trump was interrupted multiple times by protestors.  Opinion polls in key states show Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, and Trump in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Nationally, Trump has been rising in polls to pull roughly even with Clinton. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is a favorite of financial reformers, bashed Trump in prepared remarks released ahead of a speech in Washington on Tuesday. Trump‚Äôs 2006 comments, she said, amounted to rooting for ‚Äúpeople to get thrown out on the street.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe rest of us were horrified by the 2008 financial crisis,‚Äù Warren said in the comments. ‚ÄúBut Donald Trump was drooling over the idea of a housing meltdown ‚Äì because it meant he could buy up a bunch more property on the cheap.‚Äù Warren also criticized Trump for saying in a Reuters interview last week that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, enacted in response to the crisis, made it hard for bankers to operate. ‚ÄúLet me find the world‚Äôs smallest violin to play a sad, sad song,‚Äù Warren said. ‚ÄúCan Donald Trump even name three things that Dodd-Frank does? Seriously, someone ask him.‚Äù Trump did not directly respond to Warren‚Äôs comments on Tuesday, but he called her a ‚Äútotal failure‚Äù as a U.S. senator during the rally. Clinton surrogates from Ohio and Florida held a conference call with reporters about Trump‚Äôs housing statements. Her campaign hosted related events in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada, which will all be battlegrounds in November‚Äôs general election. ‚ÄúHow could Trump possibly champion the collapse of the housing market and our economy?‚Äù U.S. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said on the call. Clinton is still fighting on two fronts as she seeks to wrap up her primary battle with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont. Clinton and Sanders both campaigned on Tuesday in California, which is among six states holding Democratic nominating contests on June 7. California, the most populous U.S. state, has more Democratic delegates than any other state, and Sanders has invested heavily there. Clinton needs a solid win in California for a strong finish heading into her party‚Äôs national convention in July and to dispel questions about whether she can unite the party after a drawn-out, increasingly bitter primary race. Clinton on Monday turned down an invitation by Fox News to debate Sanders in California despite having agreed previously to a May debate. Her campaign said Clinton‚Äôs time would be better spent meeting directly with California voters. Sanders said her refusal was an insult to California voters. Sanders on Tuesday requested that the state of Kentucky review his loss there last week to Clinton by fewer than 2,000 votes. Kentucky‚Äôs secretary of state, Alison Grimes, said in a statement that the state will recanvas the results at all 120 county boards of election. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 "
Obama to return to Indiana city after seven years to highlight progress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama plans a return visit to Elkhart, Indiana, next week, some seven years after going to the city on his first trip as president, to highlight economic progress there and across the United States, the White House said on Tuesday.

In a video interview with Reuters ahead of the release of his new album ‚ÄúEarth,‚Äù the Grammy-award-winning singer-songwriter excused Donald Trump for using his music without asking his permission.  Trump‚Äôs use of ‚ÄúRockin‚Äô in the Free World‚Äù during the Republican nominee‚Äôs campaign launch raised heckles last June. Young‚Äôs management company released a statement at the time saying that Trump was not authorized to use the song in the announcement of his presidential candidacy.

He just would have liked to have been asked.¬†¬†¬†¬†  ‚ÄúThe fact that I said I was for Bernie Sanders and then he didn‚Äôt ask me to use ‚ÄòRockin‚Äô in the Free World‚Äô doesn‚Äôt mean that he can‚Äôt use it,‚Äù said Young, who has long lived on a ranch in California.  Young confirmed the Trump‚Äôs campaign statement that the campaign had a license agreement with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for the right to play the recording. ‚ÄúHe actually got a license to use it,‚Äù Young said. ‚ÄúI mean, he said he did and I believe him. So I got nothing against him. You know, once the music goes out, everybody can use it for anything.  ‚ÄúBut if the artist who made it is saying you never spoke to them, if that means something to you, you probably will stop playing it. And it meant something to Donald and he stopped.‚Äù Young says his support for Sanders in the election race was still strong, despite Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lead in the contest for the Democratic nomination.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the only one talking about the issues, about issues that matter to me, the issues on my mind - problems of corporate control of democracy and everything slipping away and not being able to have six major companies owning all the media in the United States,‚Äù Young said.  Young has retained his Canadian citizenship. Although becoming a U.S. citizen would allow him to vote in the country‚Äôs November presidential election, he dismisses the notion.¬† ‚ÄúOh, that would be a big ruse. I‚Äôm a Canadian.

Alabama House speaker's ethics trial roils state politics,"(Reuters) - Opening statements in the ethics trial of Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard got underway on Tuesday in a political drama that could rattle the Republican Party controlling the state, where two other top party leaders are ensnared in separate scandals. The proceedings against Hubbard, a powerful Republican who faces 23 ethics violations, involve actions taken in office and while he was a state party chairman. Alabama‚Äôs governor and chief judicial officer also face scrutiny in other matters.  Governor Robert Bentley, a Republican, is under fire for his relationship with a former political advisor, prompting efforts to begin impeachment proceedings this spring. Bentley is among the state party leaders who could be called to testify in the Hubbard case, according to local media. Meanwhile, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was suspended this month amid an ethics inquiry over his urging state probate judges not to grant marriage licenses to gay couples, despite a U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling that legalized gay marriage last year. Hubbard was indicted by a state grand jury in October 2014 on charges of using his elected office, along with his former post as chair of the state Republican Party, for personal gain.  He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing, describing his prosecution as politically motivated, local news outlets have reported. Hubbard‚Äôs office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. During opening arguments on Tuesday, state prosecutors said Hubbard used his powerful roles to send money to businesses that he had an interest in. ‚ÄúHe sees an opportunity and he takes it,‚Äù state prosecutor Matt Hart, who oversees a special prosecutions division, told the courtroom, the Montgomery Advertiser reported. Hubbard‚Äôs defense said it would show he had not committed the alleged felony crimes. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to prove anything,‚Äù said defense attorney Bill Baxley, according to the Advertiser newspaper. If convicted, Hubbard could see prison time and removal from office, local news outlets reported.

Lawmakers see path ahead for Puerto Rico rescue plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Congressional plan to help Puerto Rico shed billions of dollars in bad debt can win enough support to make its way to a vote in the House of Representatives, U.S. lawmakers who support the measure said on Tuesday. Under the rescue plan, an independent panel would erase some of Puerto Rico‚Äôs $70 billion debt load that has crippled the island state already facing a 45 percent poverty rate and the Zika epidemic. U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, a Republican, has endorsed the fix and the fate of the measure could help define his tenure as party leader which began in October. But Ryan can rely on some Democrats who say the rescue will aid the ailing island even if some of the legislation‚Äôs provisions are too punitive of Puerto Rico. ‚ÄúThis is the only bill that will attract enough support from our colleagues on the Republican side to pass in a Congress they control,‚Äù said Rep. Raul Grijalva, the leading Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee. Grijalva of Arizona said he expects lawmakers will ratify the plan when they write the fine-print of the legislation at a hearing on Wednesday. Rep. Rob Bishop, the panel‚Äôs chairman, postponed a law-writing session in April because of opposition to the Puerto Rico rescue but on Tuesday he said he was hopeful. Ryan and Democratic leaders stress the aid plan for the island means relief without federal spending though investors will see a cut in their Puerto Rican bond holdings and they are fighting for terms that could limit the hit to their portfolios. A leading voice for investors, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), on Tuesday backed the plan which expects Puerto Rico to control deficit spending. A Puerto Rico oversight panel, or control board, could veto Puerto Rico spending measures that it finds irresponsible and SIFMA endorsed such ‚Äúbroad powers to enforce and monitor fiscal discipline.‚Äù The oversight board would have the power to push creditors to accept a write-down of debt, even over the objections of holdout investors. The plan would also ask the oversight board to protect the interests of Puerto Rico pensioners who rely on a system that is now under funded by at least $40 billion.¬† ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 "
Ohio violated voting rights by reducing early voting: U.S. judge,"(Reuters) - A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that Ohio violated voters‚Äô rights in 2014 by cutting the number of days in which people were allowed to cast early ballots to 28 from 35. Judge Michael Watson of U.S. District Court in Columbus ordered Ohio to reinstate the 35-day period and also to grant residents a week-long opportunity to register and cast a ballot at the same time - a period known as ‚ÄúGolden Week.‚Äù If the ruling stands, voters in Ohio will be able to vote a full 35 days before the general election on Nov. 8. Watson said the earlier changes violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and were unconstitutional.  Ohio‚Äôs Republican-controlled legislature changed the system two years ago. The move was challenged by the state‚Äôs chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union.  The two groups argued that the limited opportunities for early voting directly affected minorities. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday: ‚ÄúIt is disappointing that a federal judge would again change the election rules after the current laws were upheld in the same federal district court by a settlement agreement we reached with the NAACP and the ACLU.‚Äù Husted said in a statement.  The settlement between Husted and the organizations allowed residents to vote on multiple Sundays leading up to a presidential election and gave access to additional evening voting hours, according to ACLU documents.

Senator Durbin cites problems with House Puerto Rico debt bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the chamber‚Äôs second-ranking Democrat, expressed deep reservations on Tuesday with a Puerto Rico debt relief bill being debated by a House of Representatives panel this week. ‚ÄúI want to see the final product. The initial draft, I have some real problems with it,‚Äù the Illinois lawmaker told reporters. He added that some other Democrats had also expressed strong reservations with the measure. Durbin said he was concerned that the bill that could move through the House would cut the minimum wage and overtime pay for some Puerto Ricans and fail to increase federal payments for Medicare and Medicaid, the healthcare programs for the elderly, poor and disabled, on the island. He also said there were deep concerns whether bondholders ought to be able to be paid back in full under any debt restructuring plans that would be overseen by a newly created oversight board at a time when social services are being cut on the island.  Lawmakers are trying to enact a bill to prevent further economic and social chaos in Puerto Rico, where the government faces a July 1 debt payment of $1.9 billion. The island, a territory of the United States, has a total debt of roughly $70 billion. The Republican chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee is hoping his panel votes by Wednesday to approve a Puerto Rico debt bill he negotiated with leading House Democrats and the Obama administration and send the measure to the full House for debate and passage. Durbin told reporters he heard strong opposition to the House bill during a meeting in Chicago on Monday with Puerto Rican community leaders.

"Puerto Rico crisis bill strengthens creditors, but cram-down remains","SAN JUAN (Reuters) - The Congress‚Äô latest attempt to solve Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt crisis appears to strengthen some - though not all - creditor positions in what has been a robust fight to influence the writing of a bill that lawmakers started to debate on Tuesday. The House Natural Resources Committee presented the legislation, formally called the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act or PROMESA, last week after several false starts. The bill would put Puerto Rico‚Äôs finances under a federally appointed oversight board, while allowing the U.S. territory to restructure a $70 billion debt load that threatens to collapse an economy already hamstrung by rampant emigration and a 45 percent poverty rate. While that structure is unchanged from prior drafts, several small tweaks seem to benefit bondholders, including restricting the government‚Äôs ability to override decisions of the seven-member board.¬† Still, other elements of the bill are ambiguous, experts say - including the ability of Puerto Rico to enforce cuts to creditors‚Äô debt portfolios through a bankruptcy-like court process without their consent. This is also referred to as a ‚Äúcram-down.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt strike me that there are obvious winners and losers,‚Äù said David Skeel, a bankruptcy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, adding, ‚Äúa lot will depend on who ends up on the control board, and what stance the control board takes.‚Äù The bill also allows provisions for Puerto Rico‚Äôs 18 distinct debt-issuing agencies to try to come to terms consensually with creditors, through a cooperative process where creditors would be able to vote on debt restructuring plans. Two-thirds of a creditor class would need to support a plan for it to take effect. PROMESA, also referred to as H.R. 5278, gives significant latitude to the board to manage Puerto Rico‚Äôs books and form a plan to stabilize its finances. In a change from a prior version released in April, the bill would strengthen language barring the Puerto Rican government from passing any laws to curb the board‚Äôs authority. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, the real virtue and vice of this bill is the strength of the control board,‚Äù Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who follows Puerto Rico closely, said in an interview. ¬† ¬† The latest draft would also restrict the government‚Äôs ability to transfer property on which creditors have liens. In the case of a proposal to cut repayments to creditors, it would compel a judge to assess the fairness of the proposal against Puerto Rico‚Äôs constitution, a protection absent from the April draft. Such protections seemed to modestly reassure markets when the bill was unveiled last week and investors bid up prices on Puerto Rico‚Äôs benchmark July 2035 general obligation debt. ‚ÄúThe revised language is certainly more positive for the commonwealth‚Äôs GO (General Obligation) and GO-guaranteed bondholders as it attempts to preserve the constitutional protections they currently enjoy,‚Äù Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts wrote clients. ‚ÄòCRAM-DOWN‚Äô¬† Still, the new bill retains enough ambiguity to make some creditors nervous. Most significantly, it preserves cram-down power and in one sense makes it easier to start the process.¬† That is because the latest draft of PROMESA removes a pre-condition to cram-down which would have required Puerto Rico to first complete consensual workout talks with creditors, allowing them to vote on a restructuring plan.¬† The current bill merely requires Puerto Rico to make ‚Äúgood-faith efforts‚Äù toward a cooperative deal before initiating a cram-down action.¬† Determining when Puerto Rico had satisfied that fuzzier standard would be up to the oversight board, giving the board more leeway on deciding when to push Puerto Rico into bankruptcy, and thus more leverage in creditor talks, said Melissa Jacoby, a bankruptcy expert and professor at University of North Carolina School of Law.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that the restructuring provisions are strong enough to provide the leverage to encourage voluntary deals,‚Äù Jacoby said in an interview. ‚ÄúThis bill asks a lot of Puerto Rico in some respects, and therefore, it‚Äôs not a good deal for Puerto Rico unless it has a robust restructuring possibility.‚Äù One creditor source who was not authorized to speak to the press voiced concern over how the ‚Äúgood-faith efforts‚Äù standard would be assessed: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know how the it will be enforced and those are the questions we‚Äôll be asking.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 "
Senate rejects new U.S. retirement rule; Obama ready to veto,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted along party lines on Tuesday to repeal a new Labor Department rule on retirement advice after a debate that stretched over the course of the day. The resolution, approved by a vote of 56 to 41, is a largely symbolic move that President Barack Obama has already threatened to veto. The House of Representatives passed a similar version last month. Obama‚Äôs administration in April released the rule setting a fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients‚Äô best interests ahead of their own bottom lines. Tuesday‚Äôs arguments revolved around what is best for middle- and lower-income workers. Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, say the rule will be expensive for brokers and force them to get rid of Main Street clients and small businesses that offer 401(k) plans. They also say the rule does not take into account existing regulations on financial advice.  Democrats say profit-hungry advisers have exploited middle- and lower-class workers by recommending retirement products that mostly serve to line their own pockets. Kicking off the debate, the most powerful Republican in the Senate, Kentucky‚Äôs Mitch McConnell, said blocking the rule would help ‚Äúsmaller savers.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI have sincere concerns about what this could mean for the ability of investment advisers to provide quality financial advice, but also for the ability of consumers to seek affordable retirement options,‚Äù he said. Nevada‚Äôs Harry Reid, the most powerful Democrat in the chamber, countered that there was nothing wrong with ‚Äúa rule that would require investment advisers to act in the best interest of their investors.‚Äù One Republican, Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson, described the rule as ‚Äúa solution in search of a problem,‚Äù while fellow party member Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said ‚Äúwe should call this the ‚ÄòOnly the Rich Retire‚Äô rule.‚Äù Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey said the rule would allow people to ‚Äúretire with dignity‚Äù and without worries that an ‚Äúadviser will exploit you.‚Äù Fellow Democrat Patty Murray of Washington said: ‚ÄúSome financial advisers have lined their own pockets by steering clients toward complicated investments. Some have recommended that retirees make transactions that come with hidden fees. And some get commission when they sell a financial product, even if it doesn‚Äôt make sense for a client,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúWe finally have a new protection that would right that wrong.‚Äù   ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 "
Bill to cloak U.S. 'dark money' seen as harmful to charity fraud fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fighting charity fraud could become more difficult under a Republican bill in Congress to prohibit the U.S. Internal Revenue Service from collecting the names of top donors to charities and other nonprofit groups, critics warned on Tuesday. Meant to protect the privacy of wealthy individuals who make anonymous, or ‚Äúdark money‚Äù donations to politically active nonprofit groups, the bill would eliminate a decades-old IRS donor-identity disclosure requirement for a range of tax-exempt groups that includes hospitals, universities, community and sports organizations. Backers of the legislation say donor lists have sometimes been disclosed to the public even though the names and addresses are supposed to be private.   In a related development, the IRS itself plans to propose new regulations eliminating donor-reporting requirements for most tax-exempt organizations, according to a document posted on a White House Office of Management and Budget website. It is unclear which groups would still be subject to disclosure under the regulations, which are expected in December.  But either move would deprive resource-strapped state law enforcement authorities of ready information used to look into wrongdoing by charities, state officials told Reuters. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important forensic data to us state regulators. It‚Äôs evidence we can consider using in an investigation to determine whether a charity‚Äôs board has breached its fiduciary duty,‚Äù said Hugh Jones, deputy state attorney general for Hawaii. The Republican measure was approved by a tax committee in April and awaits a House of Representatives vote. If approved it would go next to the Senate, where its outlook was unclear.  With ‚Äúdark money‚Äù and other forms of cash pouring into U.S. politics, the 2016 presidential contest is expected to cost $5 billion, double that of 2012. Campaign committees and political action committees raise most of that cash, but dark money, or spending whose sources are not disclosed, could exceed $500 million this year, up from only $6 million in 2004. Known as 501(c)s for the tax law section that covers them, these groups, under current law, must disclose donor information on a confidential basis to the IRS on Schedule B of tax Form 990. But they do not have to identify their donors publicly, which makes the groups attractive to wealthy, publicity-shy individuals with a political agenda to pursue. Representative Pete Roskam, an Illinois Republican steering the bill, said his measure is needed to protect 501(c) donors from having their identities leaked by the IRS. Such leaks could expose them to intimidation by political adversaries and infringe on their free-speech rights, he said. ‚ÄúThe IRS is ill-equipped to deal with sensitive data, and there‚Äôs a great deal of vulnerability,‚Äù Roskam told Reuters. ‚ÄúConfidentiality breached chills First Amendment rights.‚Äù  IRS officials declined to comment. Although Roskam‚Äôs bill is geared to address the concerns of political donors, critics say it will have another impact. State authorities investigating charity fraud sometimes ask nonprofit groups for their Schedule B forms, which can help investigators spot conflicts of interest and suspicious movements of money and in-kind donations between charities.  ‚ÄúWe would otherwise not have a clue that there was any relationship between charity A and charity B or charity C and D and E and F,‚Äù said Karl Emerson, former director of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Charitable Organizations. Experts said charity scams affect at least 1 percent of annual U.S. giving, or about $3.6 billion a year. Backers of the Roskam bill say Schedule B is not widely used in fraud inquiries. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know of one case where a fraud was proven by the IRS having had the Schedule B,‚Äù said David Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United. Bossie‚Äôs organization won a landmark 2010 Supreme Court case that opened the way to unlimited spending on political campaigns by individuals, corporations, unions and other groups.   Backers of the Roskam bill include Citizens United and billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who donate to a number of politically active nonprofit groups. The Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity Foundation and other groups argue that government-mandated disclosure of Schedule B information to state authorities is unconstitutional. The groups have filed lawsuits to stop Democratic attorneys general in California and New York from obtaining Schedule Bs as a part of state-level nonprofit registration procedures. In its lawsuit against California Attorney General Kamala Harris, Americans for Prosperity said more than 1,400 Schedule Bs showed up on a public state website, court documents said. The Roskam bill would preserve some disclosure by requiring nonprofits to continue to report contributions from board members, officers and top salaried employees. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 "

Louisiana governor to sign law making police killings hate crimes,"(Reuters) - Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards plans to sign legislation making it a hate crime to kill a police officer or another first responder, bolstering penalties for an offense that already qualifies for the state‚Äôs death penalty, his office said on Tuesday. The legislation adds language to an existing law enhancing penalties for crimes targeting people based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and other identity categories to include ‚Äúactual or perceived employment as a law enforcement officer, firefighter or emergency medical services personnel.‚Äù     Edwards, a Democrat whose relatives have served as law enforcement officers, is expected to sign the bill sometime this week. The state legislature unanimously approved the measure last week.  ‚ÄúPolice officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections.‚Äù  Supporters say police officers are facing increased threats simply because they wear a badge. Advocates for the law have dubbed the Louisiana measure ‚ÄúBlue Lives Matter,‚Äù a reference to the color of uniforms often worn by police. The name draws on a prominent national movement, known as Black Lives Matter, which has generated wide protest over the killings of unarmed black citizens by police officers. Yet opponents argued that the bill was unnecessary because state law already makes it a capital offense to kill police officers in the course of duty. Critics say it could weaken the hate crimes law by including a professional distinction that a matter of choice, in contrast to the color of someone‚Äôs skin.  ‚ÄúAdding professional categories to the current Hate Crimes statue deters efforts from protecting against identity-based crimes,‚Äù Allison Padilla-Goodman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas, said in a statement earlier this month. Louisiana would be the first state to use a hate crimes statute to enhance penalties for crimes against police officers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but other states allow for similar outcomes using different approaches.

Senators renew push to overhaul military handling of sex assault,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators renewed an effort on Tuesday to shift the military‚Äôs handling of sexual assault cases from top commanders to independent prosecutors, insisting that the current system has left victims too fearful of retaliation to report crimes. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat who has fought to overhaul the system for three years, introduced the legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a must-pass annual bill that sets policy for the Pentagon. The measure failed to pass the Senate in March 2014, though Gillibrand, who sits on the armed services committee, said those votes were cast amid ‚Äúfalse and misleading information‚Äù the Pentagon used to bolster its own argument. ‚ÄúWe know far more now about the extent of the military sexual assault problem than we did a year ago, and it‚Äôs clear that nothing has changed,‚Äù Gillibrand said at a news conference alongside both Democratic and Republican senators. The current system requires military commanders to handle sexual assault cases within the ranks. Supporters of the bill say the system is flawed because commanders can be unwilling to prosecute such cases and victims, fearing retaliation, are often afraid to report them.  Top military leaders at the Pentagon contend that prosecutions must remain with commanders to maintain good order and discipline. ‚ÄúNobody should be forced to go to their boss to report a rape,‚Äù Republican Senator Rand Paul said. The bill failed by 55-45 in 2014. Gillibrand said she has attempted to contact every senator who previously voted against the bill and is ‚Äúvery hopeful‚Äù the measure will this time gain the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. ‚ÄúI think many senators that we‚Äôve spoken to are concerned, deeply concerned,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe military continues to say, ‚ÄòWe got this,‚Äô ... but it‚Äôs not shown in the data. It‚Äôs not shown in the survivors‚Äô testimony.‚Äù She said the bill has not gotten support from Republican Senator John McCain, the chairman of the armed services committee, though she has spoken to him several times about the issue. Samantha Jackson, who said she was raped by her husband when he was in the Army, said the military told the U.S. attorney‚Äôs office they would investigate, only to drop her case without pursuing charges. Jackson called her treatment ‚Äúa profound betrayal,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how the Army could fail to hold my rapist accountable.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 "
Republican push to impeach U.S. IRS chief hit by Democrats,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A hard-line Republican effort to impeach the top U.S. tax collector came under fire on Tuesday from Democrats who called it an unsubstantiated partisan attack that could undermine the credibility of Congress. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen faces  allegations before the House Judiciary Committee of ignoring congressional subpoenas and misleading lawmakers. The accusations stem from a 2013 scandal in which the IRS was criticized for targeting conservative Tea Party groups‚Äô applications for tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Some Republicans want the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives to vote on impeaching Koskinen before Congress leaves for its midyear break in July. Democrats oppose the effort.  ‚ÄúThis resolution fails by every measure. It arises from the worst partisan instincts. It is not based in the facts,‚Äù Representative John Conyers said at the outset of the first of two Judiciary Committee hearings to examine charges against Koskinen. ‚ÄúWhen a vote for impeachment is divided on party lines ... we undermine our credibility,‚Äù added Conyers, the panel‚Äôs top Democrat. Koskinen angered critics by declining to testify, but submitted a statement saying the charges are without merit and fail to meet the constitutional impeachment standard of ‚Äútreason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors.‚Äù In his absence, the committee heard from Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which investigated the Tea Party scandal and concluded that Koskinen failed to preserve evidence that was later destroyed. ‚ÄúThis is really a simple case in my mind. When Congress asks you a question, you‚Äôre expected to give a truthful answer. When Congress issues a subpoena, compliance is not optional,‚Äù House oversight panel Chairman Jason Chaffetz testified. Chaffetz described impeachment as the remedy Congress has for officials guilty of breaching the public trust. But Democrats noted that IRS and Federal Bureau of Investigation probes produced no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or deliberate efforts to mislead Congress. They said the case against Koskinen showed little more than agency mismanagement and misstatements. Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte offered no direct criticism of the impeachment push, but avoided using the term other than to name impeachment as one of several options that include ‚Äúthe power to write the laws, the power of the purse ... and the power to censure.‚Äù    ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 "

"Democrats, seeking unity, give Sanders say in party platform","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Democratic Party said on Monday it would give U.S. presidential contender Bernie Sanders a prominent say in writing its platform this year, a gesture that could ease tensions between Sanders‚Äô camp and party leaders, whom Sanders has accused of favoring rival Hillary Clinton.  Sanders has remained steadfast in his long-shot battle with Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, even though he lags her in the delegate count with only a few state contests remaining. The divisiveness among the Democrats stands in contrast to the Republicans, whose party leaders are slowly rallying behind Donald Trump, their presumptive nominee. Sanders‚Äô tenacity appeared to be paying off. The U.S. senator from Vermont will be allowed to name five members to the 15-member committee that writes the platform at the Democratic National Convention in late July in Philadelphia even if he is not the nominee. Clinton will name six. The party said in a statement the split was based on the results of state votes to date ‚Äúin an effort to make this the most representative and inclusive process in history.‚Äù The party‚Äôs chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, will name the committee‚Äôs final four members. The Democratic Party‚Äôs rules allow the chair to name all 15 members, suggesting the party was trying to accommodate Sanders and his fervent supporters, who still pack rallies by the thousands as he campaigns in California, which will hold its primary on June 7. Sanders did little to dispel the acrimony between himself and the party, which he joined only last year after more than two decades in Congress as an independent, when he said over the weekend he was endorsing Wasserman Schultz‚Äôs Democratic opponent in her Florida congressional district. On Monday, he repeated some of his criticisms of Clinton, who he has suggested is vulnerable to influence by corporate donors to her campaign, which she denies.  Sanders also told the Associated Press in an interview that if Democratic leaders open the convention‚Äôs doors ‚Äúto working-class people and young people and create the kind of dynamism that the Democratic Party needs, it‚Äôs going to be messy.‚Äù ‚ÄúDemocracy is not always nice and quiet and gentle but that is where the Democratic Party should go,‚Äù he added. The Clinton campaign said it was pleased to see Sanders represented, describing the party as a ‚Äúbig tent.‚Äù ‚ÄúHillary Clinton is committed to continue welcoming different perspectives and ideas,‚Äù spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. Sanders, who has criticized Clinton for being too biased toward Israel, has named a pro-Palestinian activist and a prominent environmentalist among his picks for the committee. Clinton has said she now considers herself the de facto Democratic nominee. Increasingly, she has turned her attention to attacking Trump as a ‚Äúbully‚Äù when speaking at campaign events while urging Sanders supporters to rally to her side. She told labor union members in Detroit on Monday that if elected, she would embrace issues important to Sanders‚Äô supporters, including reform of campaign financing and reducing income inequality. Underlining Clinton‚Äôs confidence that she will become the Democratic candidate, her campaign said on Monday she would not participate in a debate with Sanders in California, despite having previously agreed to attend the event hosted by Fox News.     Trump is steadily escalating his criticism of both Hillary and Bill Clinton‚Äôs relationship with women, using rhetoric that has little precedent in U.S. presidential politics.  On Monday, Trump circulated a new online video that shows images of Bill Clinton, the former president, as voices of women play on the soundtrack saying he had assaulted them, before ending with the sound of Hillary Clinton, his wife, laughing. Although none of the women are identified in the video, one of the voices is that of Juanita Broaddrick in an NBC interview from 1999 in which the former nursing-home manager accused Bill Clinton of raping her in a hotel in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1978. The Clintons‚Äô lawyer, David Kendall, said in 1999 that the accusation was false. The Clintons have declined to discuss the accusation and are ignoring his personal attacks, with Hillary Clinton saying instead she will defend vulnerable Americans from the consequences of Trump‚Äôs proposals. ‚ÄúTrump economics is a recipe for lower wages, fewer jobs, more debt,‚Äù she told the union members on Monday. ‚ÄúHe could bankrupt America like he bankrupted his companies.

Facebook changes policies on 'Trending Topics' after criticism,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Monday that it had changed some of the procedures for its ‚ÄúTrending Topics‚Äù section after a news report alleging it suppressed conservative news prompted a U.S. Congressional demand for more transparency. The company said an internal probe showed no evidence of political bias in the selection of news stories for Trending Topics, a feature that is separate from the main ‚Äúnews feed‚Äù where most Facebook users get their news. But the world‚Äôs largest social network said in a blogpost that it was introducing several changes, including elimination of a top-ten list of approved websites, more training and clearer guidelines to help human editors avoid ideological or political bias, and more robust review procedures. Earlier this month, a former Facebook contractor had accused the company‚Äôs editors of deliberately suppressing conservative news. The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo, which did not identify the ex-contractor.  The report led Republican Sen. John Thune to write a letter demanding that the company explain how it selects news articles for its Trending Topics list. (bit.ly/1Tvv3Nm) Two days after Thune‚Äôs letter, Facebook published a lengthy blogpost detailing how Trending Topics works even though it rarely discloses such practices. Previously, it had never discussed the inner workings of the feature, which displays topics and news articles in the top right hand corner of the desktop homepage for its more than 1.6 billion users. Facebook said its investigation showed that conservative and liberal topics were approved as trending topics at nearly identical rates. It said it was unable to substantiate any allegations of politically motivated suppression of particular subjects or sources. But it did not rule out human error in selecting topics. ‚ÄúOur investigation could not fully exclude the possibility of isolated improper actions or unintentional bias in the implementation of our guidelines or policies,‚Äù Colin Stretch, Facebook‚Äôs General Counsel, wrote in a company blogpost.

"U.S., Vietnam agree to allow Peace Corps into Vietnam for first time","HANOI (Reuters) - The United States and Vietnam on Tuesday signed an agreement allowing the U.S. Peace Corps to work in the country for the first time. The signing, which comes amid a historic three-day visit by President Barack Obama, follows more than a decade of negotiations between the two countries to establish a Peace Corps operation in Vietnam. The program, which is expected to begin over the next two years, allows Peace Corps volunteers to teach English in schools in the country‚Äôs two largest cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, said Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet, who signed the agreement with Vietnam‚Äôs ambassador to the United States, Pham Quang Vinh. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who was present for the signing, said the agreement marked a further normalizing of relations between the United States and Vietnam. ‚ÄúFor 20 years now we have had what we call a normal relationship,‚Äù said Kerry, who in 1968 served as a young U.S. naval officer in the Vietnam War.  ‚ÄúThis is normal, having the Peace Corps being able to move forward, having young Americans come here, not always young, to be able to teach English in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh is the next step forward to building the relationship between the United States and Vietnam,‚Äù he added.

House rejects bill requiring carriers to share phone location,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted down on Monday a measure that would have compelled cell phone carriers to disclose a phone‚Äôs location with law enforcement in the event of an emergency, amid a last-minute lobbying effort from privacy advocates opposed to it. Lawmakers voted 229-158 to pass the Kelsey Smith Act, falling short of the two-thirds threshold necessary due to rules invoked to expedite the bill‚Äôs vote. The rejection was considered surprising, as House leadership rarely schedules a vote on legislation it is not confident will pass. However, Civil liberties groups aggressively opposed the bill on Monday, arguing that while well intended, it would create a warrant loophole and could lead to expanded government surveillance.  R Street, a libertarian-leaning think tank, said phone companies already possess the authority to share cell phone location data in emergency situations and did so frequently, making the legislation largely unnecessary. The bill is named after a deceased 18-year-old Kansas woman who disappeared following a visit to a local Target store in 2007. Smith was found murdered four days later only after Verizon, her cell phone provider, shared the location of her phone with authorities, according to Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican and author of the bill. ‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôm disappointed in tonight‚Äôs outcome, I look forward to the bill being brought back to the House floor when a simple majority vote can get it passed.‚Äù Yoder said in a statement. Smith‚Äôs parents were in attendance in the House chamber during the vote, according to Yoder‚Äôs office. More than 20 states have already adopted versions of the law since Smith‚Äôs death.

Clinton turns down Fox News offer to debate Sanders again,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, turned down on Monday an invitation by Fox News to debate rival Bernie Sanders in California, despite having agreed previously to a debate in May. ‚ÄúWe believe that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time is best spent campaigning and¬†meeting directly with voters across California and preparing for a¬†general election campaign that will ensure the White House remains in Democratic hands,‚Äù her campaign said in a statement.

The U.S. senator from Vermont has remained steadfast in his long-shot battle with Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, although he lags her in the delegate count with only a few state contests remaining.‚ÄùNaturally, Fox News is disappointed that Secretary Clinton has declined our debate invitation,‚Äù Bill Sammon, Fox News vice president and Washington managing editor, said in a statement, ‚Äúespecially given that the race is still contested and she had previously agreed to a final debate before the California primary.‚Äù California holds its primary on June 7.

Judge halts Ohio law that blocked funds for Planned Parenthood,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A federal judge in Cincinnati temporarily blocked the implementation of a state law that would have effectively de-funded 28 Ohio Planned Parenthood clinics, in a ruling on Monday. U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett granted a two-week stay halting the diversion of federal funding in a ruling on a May 11 lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Southwest Ohio. The Ohio law signed in February by Republican Governor John Kasich stripped $1.3 million in federal taxpayer funds from any healthcare organization that provides abortion services. The law was scheduled to go into effect on Monday. The new rules affected funding for Planned Parenthood programs for mothers‚Äô and infants‚Äô health, HIV counseling and testing, and sex education. Planned Parenthood offers abortions in some of its Ohio clinics, but not all of them. In a 20-page opinion, Barrett said the law was enacted to make it difficult for women to obtain an abortion, and said that Planned Parenthood had shown it could successfully win its legal action. He wrote that Planned Parenthood would be ‚Äúforced to end health care and education programs and terminate employees, depriving thousands of Ohioans of high-quality, affordable health care services and education programs.‚Äù Ohio already has a law barring the use of state funding for abortions. The lawsuit was one of a number of legal actions filed by Planned Parenthood over access to healthcare at its centers since mid-2015, when anti-abortion activists began releasing videos purporting to show group officials negotiating prices for aborted fetal tissue. Ohio Right to Life president Mike Gonidakis chastised Barrett as an ‚Äúactivist judge‚Äù for the ruling. ‚ÄúDespite the will of the people, Planned Parenthood will continue to feed at the trough of taxpayer dollars for another two weeks. Today, Planned Parenthood‚Äôs greed and power are on full display in Ohio,‚Äù Gonidakis said in a statement. Jerry Lawson, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio, applauded the ruling. ‚ÄúThis ruling is a victory for the tens of thousands of Ohioans that rely on Planned Parenthood for care each year,‚Äù he said in a statement. Planned Parenthood attorneys had argued that the new law would be an unconstitutional burden on abortion rights and that it violated the equal protection clause by treating the organization differently from other healthcare providers.

Leading House conservative wants IRS chief impeached,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a hard-line Republican conservative faction in the U.S. Congress wants to impeach the nation‚Äôs top tax officer and said lawmakers could do this without accusing him of any crime. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen should be impeached within weeks, said Jim Jordan, chairman of the House of Representatives Freedom Caucus, in an interview. Jordan‚Äôs demand comes amid numerous Republican attacks on the IRS in recent months. Bashing the tax-collecting agency is a perennial Capitol Hill practice, but Jordan and a handful of other conservatives have been pushing it further than usual. He said Jordan could be impeached simply because he had betrayed the trust put in him by the U.S. public to carry out his job correctly. ‚ÄúWhen someone violates the public trust in such a way as this individual has, and that agency has, then that‚Äôs what warrants ... impeachment,‚Äù Jordan said. Impeachment is a formal charge of wrongdoing for a trial that would occur in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is necessary for removal from office. Republicans control only 54 of the 100 Senate seats, making such a vote unlikely. Asked when the House should act, the Ohio Republican replied: ‚ÄúI hope before we leave for the summer break.‚Äù    The IRS said in a statement that Koskinen has provided Congress with full cooperation and truthful testimony and remains focused on serving U.S. taxpayers. On Tuesday, Republicans will detail their complaints about Koskinen at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. Never popular with lawmakers, the IRS angered Republicans in 2013-2014 in a controversy over its handling of applications from conservative political groups for tax-exempt status. The episode caused a shake-up of top IRS personnel. Koskinen was brought in by the Obama administration in late 2013 to restore order. But the House has since approved several bills attacking the IRS and its budget has been sharply cut.      Jordan said a second hearing in June would be about determining the standard for impeachment. The grounds for impeachment listed in the Constitution are ‚Äútreason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.‚Äù Koskinen has declined an invitation to testify on Tuesday. He is accused of failing to comply with a congressional subpoena and misleading investigators. Republicans have said his inaction resulted in the destruction of thousands of key emails. Up to now, impeachment has been used against two presidents, a cabinet secretary, a senator and 15 federal judges, according to the Congressional Research Service.   ",politicsNews,"May 23, 2016 "
Senate poised to vote to repeal new retirement advice rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday will take up, and likely pass, a resolution to repeal a new Labor Department rule aimed at protecting retirement savers from profit-hungry brokers, a move that President Barack Obama has threatened to veto. A notice sent to senators on Monday showed that a debate and vote on the resolution were scheduled for Tuesday morning, less than a week before the chamber recesses for the Memorial Day holiday. The vote requires a simple majority, which Republicans command in both houses of Congress. The House of Representatives passed its version of the resolution last month, in a vote along party lines.  But the resolution will have a short life span. Obama has threatened to veto legislation undoing a key financial initiative of his second term. His administration in April released the rule to set a fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients‚Äô best interests ahead of their bottom lines.  Republican leaders and some in the financial industry said complying with the rule would be expensive for brokers and result in higher costs for retirement advice that many Americans could not afford. They also said the rule did not take into account other laws and regulations on financial advice. The Senate fight started early, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, saying on Monday that Republicans wanted to ‚Äúmake it easier - easier - for giant Wall Street financial institutions to cheat Americans out of their retirement savings.‚Äù Speaking on the Senate floor, the advocate for stricter financial regulation also said the vote was motivated by election-year politics and that the resolution ‚Äúwill sure help fill up the campaign accounts of the Republican senators who vote for it.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 23, 2016 "
U.S. justices rule against Virginia Republicans in black voters case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a lower court ruling that Virginia‚Äôs Republican-led legislature unlawfully considered race when drawing U.S. congressional districts by packing black voters into one in a move opponents said diluted black electoral clout. The case focused on the composition of a majority-black U.S. House of Representatives district, stretching from Richmond to Norfolk, held by the only black member of Virginia‚Äôs congressional delegation, Democrat Bobby Scott. The justices ruled 8-0 against a group of current and former Republican U.S. House members who challenged a June 2015 lower court ruling that invalidated the district‚Äôs boundaries after several voters who lived there filed suit in 2013. Virginia‚Äôs Democratic attorney general decided not to appeal the 2015 ruling, but the Republican lawmakers took up the case. The Supreme Court on Monday found that those lawmakers lacked legal standing to bring the case in part because they could not show they were harmed by the lower court decision. The voters who sued in 2013 said Scott‚Äôs district was racially ‚Äúgerrymandered‚Äù by state legislators in 2012 to cram black voters into it and reduce black influence in neighboring districts in violation of the U.S. Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs guarantee of equal protection under the law. Michele Jawando, a lawyer with the liberal advocacy group Center for American Progress, called the ruling ‚Äúgood news not only for Virginia voters and voting advocates, but also for other states currently dealing with constitutional issues around their congressional district maps.‚Äù ‚ÄúA just and fair democracy necessitates that all voters can access the ballot without worrying about political games and racial discrimination,‚Äù Jawando added. Democrats have accused Republican legislators around the country of drawing electoral maps to minimize the influence of black and Hispanic voters, who tend to cast ballots for Democratic candidates. Republicans have accused Democrats in Democratic-led states of using the so-called redistricting process to minimize the clout of Republican-leaning voters. Following the 2015 ruling, the boundaries of an adjoining district, currently represented by white Republican Randy Forbes, were redrawn to add some black voters from Scott‚Äôs district. This could make the district a possible Democratic pickup in the Nov. 8 election. Forbes is one of the Republicans who appealed to the Supreme Court. Two of the others, Robert Wittman and David Brat, said they had legal standing to bring the case because their chances of re-election would be reduced by having more Democratic voters in their districts.

North Korean envoy rejects Trump overture to meet leader,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a ‚Äúkind of propaganda or advertisement‚Äù in his election race, a senior North Korean official said on Monday. Trump, in a wide-ranging interview with Reuters in New York last week, said he is willing to talk to the North Korean leader to try to stop Pyongyang‚Äôs nuclear program, proposing a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation. ‚ÄúIt is up to the decision of my Supreme Leader whether he decides to meet or not, but I think his (Trump‚Äôs) idea or talk is nonsense,‚Äù So Se Pyong, North Korea‚Äôs ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters on return from Pyongyang after attending the first ruling party congress in 36 years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for utilization of the presidential election, that‚Äôs all. A kind of a propaganda or advertisement,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is useless, just a gesture for the presidential election.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is no meaning, no sincerity,‚Äù So added. As a candidate, U.S. President Barack Obama made unfulfilled campaign promises to meet the leader of the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK), he said. North Korea conducted a fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket in February, triggering tougher international sanctions and the adoption of a more hardline position by South Korean President Park Geun-hye. So, who is also North Korea‚Äôs ambassador to the U.N.-backed Conference on Disarmament, reiterated that his country was prepared to return to stalled six-party talks on its nuclear program. China and Russia backed the idea, but the United States and its allies South Korea and Japan reject it, he said. ‚ÄúAs a responsible nuclear state ... we will never use them first,‚Äù So said. ‚ÄúIf the United States use their nuclear weapons first, then we have to use also that one.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf the United States gives up their hostile policies and changes their attitude, then we also (can) have relations as a normal country,‚Äù So said. ‚ÄúTo South Korea, we proposed high-level military talks but South Korea refused now.‚Äù South Korea dismissed on Monday a North Korean proposal for military talks as ‚Äúa bogus peace offensive‚Äù and said it was formally rejecting the overture because it lacked a plan to end the North‚Äôs nuclear program.

"Sanders rejects deal on Puerto Rico, offers alternative","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday rejected a bipartisan deal reached in the House of Representatives on legislation to address Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt crisis, calling it a concession to Wall Street. Breaking with the Obama administration, Sanders called on Senate colleagues to instead back an alternative he has proposed to allow the U.S. territory the same access to restructure its debt in bankruptcy court that is afforded to municipalities. Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives last week unveiled a bill, hammered out in talks between lawmakers from both parties, that included a framework for restructuring Puerto Rico‚Äôs $70 billion in debt and putting the island‚Äôs financial operations under the control of a federal oversight board. A House vote is expected in the first week of June, ahead of a $1.9 billion debt payment due on July 1, but any legislation would have to clear the Senate as well. Democratic congressional leaders have acknowledged disagreements with some parts of the bill but said negotiations had led to a workable compromise, and the Obama administration has urged Congress to quickly pass it. ‚ÄúIt is critical that Congress pass this as there are very significant bond payments due in July,‚Äù U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said last week. ‚ÄúTime is of the essence.‚Äù Sanders‚Äô rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, has also backed the legislation. But Sanders, who represents Vermont as an independent but who caucuses with Democrats, said Wall Street would benefit at the expense of Puerto Rico‚Äôs workers. ‚ÄúThis legislation looks out for the needs of Wall Street vulture funds first and foremost. That is unacceptable,‚Äù he wrote in a letter to Senate colleagues on Monday. He cited provisions exempting residents from new overtime protections and allowing minimum wage on the island to dip to $4.25 for a period of up to five years, far lower than the U.S. minimum wage of $7.25.  Instead, Sanders said the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury Department could find other solutions, such as providing loans to Puerto Rico‚Äôs electric authority and water agency, and directly purchasing new bonds issued by the U.S. commonwealth.

Virginia GOP sues governor over restoring voting rights to felons,"RICHMOND (Reuters) - Virginia Republicans on Monday sued to nullify Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe‚Äôs order restoring voting rights to 206,000 felons, a move that could affect the November presidential election. The lawsuit in the Virginia Supreme Court asked justices to require the voting registrars not to sign up felons based on McAuliffe‚Äôs April 22 order and to cancel felons‚Äô registrations since the order was issued. Republicans argued that McAuliffe‚Äôs order was unconstitutional. The lawsuit was headed by leaders of the Republican-controlled state legislature. ‚ÄúThe Governor is authorized to restore the voting rights of any convicted felon through an individualized grant of clemency, but he may not issue a blanket restoration of voting rights,‚Äù the lawsuit said. Virginia is considered a key swing state in the 2016 election. The governor‚Äôs order could tip the balance in favor of the Democratic candidate who wins the party‚Äôs nomination. House Speaker William Howell said in a statement that  McAuliffe‚Äôs order violated 240 years of practice. ‚ÄúGovernor McAuliffe‚Äôs executive order defies the plain text of the Constitution, flouts the separation of powers, and has no precedent in the annals of Virginia history,‚Äù Howell said. McAuliffe and other Democrats have hailed the restoration of rights to felons who have served their sentences and completed probation as being long overdue. Since signing the order, McAuliffe has said that nearly 80 percent of the felons whose rights were restored are nonviolent offenders who have been free for more than a decade. Caucasian felons made up 51.5 percent of the total whose rights were restored, and African-Americans 45.9 percent. Before McAuliffe‚Äôs order, felons had to petition the governor individually for restoration of their voting rights.  About two dozen states have eased restrictions on felons casting ballots over the past two decades, according to the Sentencing Project, a prison reform advocacy group.

"Looming U.S. abortion ruling could be 'dangerous,' says top attorney","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As a Supreme Court decision on abortion rights is highly anticipated in the United States, few are as uniquely positioned to assess its impact as reproductive rights attorney Kathryn Kolbert, who argued the last major abortion case before the high court. In that 1992 challenge, the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion survived, but the Supreme Court allowed for such state regulations as waiting periods. The decision was written by Justices Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor and David Souter, who have retired, and Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy is seen as pivotal in the current case which picks up, in a sense, where the earlier case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, left off. This time, the court is deciding if Texas has created an undue burden for women by imposing stiff regulations on abortion clinics and doctors. Critics say the rules are a backdoor means to restrict access to abortion, known as TRAP laws. More than half of Texas‚Äô clinics have closed, leaving fewer than 20, advocates say, to serve the state of 27 million people. Hardest hit have been rural, poor women for whom distance and cost have put abortions out of reach, they say. Supporters of the laws say they protect women‚Äôs health, however. The regulations require clinics to upgrade to hospital standards and doctors performing abortions to have formal agreements to admit patients to local hospitals.  Kolbert, who heads the Athena Center for Leadership Studies at New York‚Äôs Barnard College, talked with the Thomson Reuters Foundation about the Supreme Court and abortion rights. She co-founded the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, which is representing Whole Women‚Äôs Health, the chain of clinics challenging the Texas regulations. THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION: It seems the issues being addressed in the Texas case come out of the Casey case, that the regulations are an undue burden. KOLBERT: The main issue in the case is how the undue burden standard will be interpreted going forward. The whole question comes down to Justice Kennedy and how he sees that standard, and he frankly is much more in the middle. Does he come back to what he articulated in Casey, or is he pushed a little bit to the right with the influence of the other justices? For me, the biggest concern is Justice O‚ÄôConnor, who he clearly listened to, is no longer on the court. TRF: What do you think in essence underlies the abortion issue? KOLBERT: It‚Äôs an issue that ties together the coalitions on the right, the fundamentalists, the Catholics, the people who basically are business conservatives. It‚Äôs about power. It‚Äôs about equality. There‚Äôs a lot of pushback in America still about giving women the ability to go beyond what they are, their life as a wife and mother, which is the culturally dominant view.  TRF: TRAP laws are often hard to explain because they seem so benign. KOLBERT: That‚Äôs a strategy. Those who are writing these restrictions are looking for things that sound reasonable but in practice are incredibly problematic for women, particularly those who have less political power. So young women and poor women are the first that are going to be affected negatively. If you look at every restriction that‚Äôs been introduced since 1973, they are all under the guise of reasonableness. TRF: Texas is the case being tested. Is it safe to say there are similar situations in other states? KOLBERT: All over the country, yes. Frankly, if this is upheld the same statute will be enacted in 25 states within three years. That‚Äôs what makes it so dangerous. TRF: What are the possibilities of what the Supreme Court could do? KOLBERT: Remember the court has got only eight justices right now, so the option is really one of three. We win five to three, which means that we have (Justice Elena) Kagan, (Justice Stephen) Breyer, (Justice Sonia) Sotomayor, (Justice Ruth) Ginsberg and Kennedy.... Kennedy wrote Casey, so that‚Äôs a reasonable assumption. The second possibility is that the court would not make a decision right now and would send the case back for taking of additional evidence ... which is what I think of as looking for an out. They could remand the case for a determination of whether or not there are a sufficient number of clinics within the state to handle the excess capacity of women needing abortions that would happen when you close so many clinics. So we could win, there could be an ‚Äòout‚Äô or we could lose. If the court divided four-four..., then the lower court decision would be upheld. That would be interpreted as a major win for the anti-abortion groups, and we would see laws like this in every state in the country. TRF: If you had to put your money on any of those three options, which one do you see more likely? KOLBERT: I certainly hope that we can keep Justice Kennedy. If not, then I think they‚Äôll send it back for more evidence. TRF: What‚Äôs it like to argue a case before the Supreme Court?  KOLBERT: It‚Äôs pretty awesome, it‚Äôs scary. For me though it was all about the women we were representing. It‚Äôs the doctors and the clinics, the providers who do the hard work, who meet with women facing unintended pregnancies every single day. It was being able to be a spokesperson for them and to explain their plight and explain what they‚Äôre going through that was the most gratifying part of the job. ",politicsNews,"May 23, 2016 "
Sanders steps up feud with Democratic establishment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders cranked up his fight with party leaders on Sunday, backing a challenger to the Democratic National Committee‚Äôs chairwoman and accusing the party‚Äôs establishment of trying to anoint Hillary Clinton as the nominee for president. In a series of television interviews, Sanders remained defiant despite what he acknowledged was an uphill fight to overtake front-runner Clinton.  Clinton has said she already considers herself the de facto nominee and is increasingly turning her attention to Donald Trump, saying on Sunday that the rhetoric of the presumptive Republican nominee was dangerous. Sanders told ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù program that Americans should not have to choose between ‚Äúthe lesser of two evils‚Äù in the Nov. 8 election. Sanders said that if he won the White House, he would not reappoint U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chairwoman. He also endorsed law professor Tim Canova, who is challenging the Florida congresswoman in the August Democratic primary. ‚ÄúDo I think she is the kind of chair that the Democratic Party needs? No, I don‚Äôt,‚Äù Sanders told CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù ‚ÄúFrankly, what the Democratic Party is about is running around to rich people‚Äôs homes and raising obscene sums of money from wealthy people. What we need to do is to say to working-class people ‚Äì we are on your side,‚Äù he said. The defiant tone by Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has worried some Democrats anxious to see Clinton begin to unify the party and turn her attention to an election showdown with Trump. Clinton painted Trump as a risk of the sort voters had not seen before in an interview with NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù that aired on Sunday. ‚ÄúI do not want Americans, and, you know, good-thinking Republicans, as well as Democrats and independents, to start to believe that this is a normal candidacy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt.‚Äù  Trump has gained ground in opinion polls as Republicans begin to rally around his candidacy. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Sunday showed Trump with a 2-point lead over Clinton, within the margin of error. In early March, Clinton led Trump by 9 points in the same poll. But Sanders has ignored growing Democratic calls to step aside and repeated his vow to stay in the race until the party‚Äôs July 25-28 nominating convention in Philadelphia despite Clinton‚Äôs nearly insurmountable lead in pledged convention delegates who will choose the nominee. He said he wanted to do away with superdelegates - party leaders who are free to support any candidate. Their rush to back Clinton even before votes had been cast amounted to ‚Äúan anointment process,‚Äù Sanders said. He promised to influence the party platform and party rules even if he was not the nominee, but said if Clinton did not move toward his views on reining in Wall Street, reducing income equality and other issues, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs going to have her problems.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see the American people voting for the lesser of two evils. I want the American people to be voting for a vision of economic justice, of social justice, of environmental justice, of racial justice,‚Äù he said on ABC. After Sanders‚Äô endorsement of her opponent, Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that she would remain neutral in the  Democratic presidential race. Democratic worries about party unity were exacerbated by last weekend‚Äôs state party convention in Nevada, where unhappy Sanders supporters disrupted the proceedings in a dispute over rules. That raised fears about possible chaos at the national convention in Philadelphia. But Sanders disputed media reports describing the Nevada incident as violent. ‚ÄúWhat happened is people were rude, that‚Äôs not good, they were booing, that‚Äôs not good, they behaved in some ways that were a little bit boorish, not good, but let‚Äôs not talk about that as violence,‚Äù he said on ABC. Sanders said he was not encouraging protests at the Philadelphia convention, ‚Äúbut of course people have the right to peacefully assemble and make their views heard.‚Äù     Clinton said in the NBC interview that she would talk to Sanders about his policy demands and take them into account ‚Äúwhen he‚Äôs ready to talk.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 22, 2016 "

U.S defense secretary apologizes after American charged in Japanese woman's death,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter called his Japanese counterpart on Saturday to express regrets after an American working at a U.S. military base in Japan was arrested on suspicion of dumping the body of a Japanese woman. The case in Okinawa has sparked a protest from Tokyo and could add to resentment of the large U.S. military presence on the island, where Japanese have long been upset by crimes committed by Americans. It also is likely to stir anti-U.S. sentiment as President Barack Obama visits Japan next week. In his call to Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, Carter ‚Äúextended his sincere apologies to the victim‚Äôs family and friends,‚Äù Defense Department spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement. ‚ÄúHe also expressed his sympathies to the people of Japan,‚Äù the statement said.  A 32-year-old American working at the base on Okinawa admitted to abandoning the corpse of a 20-year-old Japanese woman but did not comment about whether he had killed her, an Okinawa police spokesman said earlier this week. The Pentagon has said the man was a contractor but did not name him. The Pentagon statement said the Defense Department would cooperate with the Japanese government in the investigation and work to prevent similar incidents. Obama is going to Japan for a Group of Seven summit and also will become the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima, a city destroyed by a U.S. atomic bomb 71 years ago in World War Two. Okinawa, the site of a bloody World War Two battle, hosts the bulk of U.S. military forces based in Japan since the war     with U.S. installations taking up about 18 percent of the island. Earlier this year, a U.S. serviceman stationed in Okinawa was arrested on suspicion of raping a woman. In the most infamous post-war case involving Americans on Okinawa, three American servicemen raped a 12-year-old girl in 1995. ",politicsNews,"May 21, 2016 "
Trump rallies gun owners with fiery anti-Clinton speech,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump assured gun owners on Friday he would protect their constitutional right to bear arms and eliminate gun-free zones if elected, accusing Democrat Hillary Clinton of wanting to weaken gun rights. Trump, who will almost certainly be the Republican presidential nominee, picked up the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, a politically powerful lobbying group which claims more than 4 million members.  Trump‚Äôs remarks at the NRA‚Äôs national convention in Louisville, Kentucky, were not a surprise, but they could solidify his status among conservatives who see protecting the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs Second Amendment as a top priority.  Trump also planned to meet on Monday with U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a source close to the Trump campaign said. The two are expected to consult on foreign policy. The source said Corker remains on Trump‚Äôs list of potential vice presidential running mates. Clinton, who is close to clinching the Democratic Party‚Äôs nomination for the Nov. 8 election, has vowed to take on the gun lobby and expand gun control measures to include comprehensive background checks for gun buyers, including at open-air gun shows and online. Trump, who is trying to unite the Republican Party behind him after a brutal primary battle, accused Clinton, a former secretary of state to President Barack Obama, of wanting to end the 2nd Amendment, which says in part that the people‚Äôs right to keep and bear arms ‚Äúshall not be infringed.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment, not change it; she wants to abolish it,‚Äù Trump said. Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Maya Harris said Trump is peddling falsehoods and denounced ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs conspiracy theories.‚Äù She said Clinton believes there are ‚Äúcommon-sense steps we can take at the federal level to keep guns out of the hands of criminals‚Äù while protecting the Second Amendment. Trump told the NRA he would eliminate gun-free zones imposed in some areas, noting that the 2015 shooting deaths of four U.S. Marines at an armed forces recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, took place in a gun-free zone. ‚ÄúThe Second Amendment is on the ballot in November,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person you know: Donald Trump.‚Äù The NRA‚Äôs convention took place on the same day that a man brandished a gun at a checkpoint near the White House in Washington and was shot and wounded by a law enforcement officer. The New York billionaire‚Äôs NRA speech was another step in his drive to make more conservatives comfortable with his candidacy. Earlier this week, he released a list of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees who are conservative jurists, a step well-received on the right. Many conservatives, who had backed other Republican candidates in the 2016 race, worry that Trump is a closet liberal on many issues. But Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA‚Äôs Institute for Legislative Action, said it was time for them to get over their qualms about the 69-year-old candidate. ‚ÄúIf your preferred candidate is out of the race, it‚Äôs time to get over it,‚Äù Cox told the NRA audience. ‚ÄúAre there valid arguments in favor of some over others? Sure. Will any of it matter if Hillary wins in November? Not one bit.‚Äù In another step toward trying to unify the party, Cox has invited members of Congress to a ‚Äúsmall roundtable discussion‚Äù with one of Trump‚Äôs sons, Donald Trump Jr., on Wednesday at the Capitol Hill Club near the U.S. Capitol, a copy of the invitation said.

Trump loaned White House campaign $7.5 million as he nears Republican nomination,"(Reuters) - Donald Trump raised $1.7 million from donors and loaned his White House campaign $7.5 million in April as he moved closer to becoming the Republican nominee for president, according to documents filed with the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Friday. The New York businessman had loaned his campaign a total of $43.5 million as of the end of April, the filings showed. More recently, he has made moves to build up his fundraising operation with an eye toward the Nov. 8 general election. Trump became the Republican Party‚Äôs presumptive nominee in early May, when both of his rivals dropped out of the race. Trump self-funded much of his primary run, but he has said he will not rely as heavily on his own money for the general election, when he will face the Democratic nominee. Both people seeking the Democratic nomination have raised more than Trump. Hillary Clinton, the party‚Äôs front-runner, brought in $26.4 million in April, including funds from a joint fundraising effort with the Democratic Party.  An outside Super PAC supporting her campaign raised $8.6 million. A Super PAC is a fund-raising group that must operate separate from political campaigns but can raise unlimited sums. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton‚Äôs rival for the Democratic nomination, raised $26.9¬†million in April. He has disavowed Super PACs. Trump has criticized them too, though a long-time Republican operative in May joined one Super PAC backing the real estate mogul. In May, Trump hired investor Steven Mnuchin as his national finance chairman and entered a joint fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee that will allow donors to write much bigger checks. Friday‚Äôs FEC filings do not reflect these moves, but they show that Trump‚Äôs fundraising dipped in April, after he brought in about $3 million and loaned himself $11.5 million in March.  He also spent less in April, $9.4 million compared with $13.8 million a month earlier, when more states held nominating contests. Trump spent $2.6 million on advertising in April, less than half the $6.3 million he spent in March. By comparison, Sanders spent $17.3 million and Clinton spent $9.3 million on advertising in April.     Trump‚Äôs consulting and payroll spending also dropped about 30 percent to a total $1.7 million in April, even as he added experienced political staff. At the end of March, he hired veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort.      Trump ended April with $2.4 million on hand, after starting the month with $2.1 million at the ready.

Some in Oklahoma statehouse urge Obama impeachment over bathroom rule,"OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Republican state lawmakers in Oklahoma have introduced a resolution urging the state‚Äôs congressional delegation to start an effort to impeach President Barack Obama over a White House recommendation that schools accommodate transgender students. The Obama administration told U.S. public schools last week that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice. The recommendation upset Republicans and raised the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority. The Oklahoma resolution, introduced on Thursday night, calls on the state‚Äôs members of the U.S. House of Representatives to file articles of impeachment against Obama, the U.S. attorney general, the U.S. secretary of education and others over the policy. A vote has not yet been scheduled on the resolution. Legal experts told local media the impeachment call is on shaky ground since the recommendation offered non-binding guidance and did not have the force of law. Lawmakers in the socially conservative state took up another measure on Friday that would allow students to claim a religious right to have separate but equal bathrooms and changing facilities to segregate them from transgender students. That bill, introduced on Thursday night and referred to a Senate committee on Friday, could force schools into costly construction, which would be difficult for them to complete after lawmakers significantly cut education funding to plug a $1.3 billion state budget shortfall.  State Representative John Bennett, a Republican, said in a statement the White House policy was ‚Äúbiblically wrong,‚Äù and a violation of state sovereignty. The Oklahoma bill would allow for segregation at school restrooms, athletic changing facilities and showers if a request is made to accommodate religious beliefs.   It also allows the attorney general to file lawsuits to implement the changes.  Impeachment advocates say Obama overstepped his constitutional authority. Troy Stevenson, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an LGBT advocacy group said the measure promoted fear-mongering and was out of place ‚ÄúIn a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth,‚Äù he said in a statement.¬† The measure was introduced just hours after state lawmakers approved a bill that would make abortions a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for doctors who perform them.  Governor Mary Fallin, an anti-abortion Republican, vetoed the bill because it would not withstand a criminal constitutional legal challenge, her office said. ",politicsNews,"May 20, 2016 "
U.S. panel probing Benghazi attack to report within month: chair,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House panel investigating the 2012 Benghazi attack that killed Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans will release its report on the incident in the next month, the congressman leading the inquiry told MSNBC on Friday. Representative Trey Gowdy, who is in charge of the two-year-old investigation in the House of Representatives, told MSNBC the committee‚Äôs report would be finished and released before Republican and Democratic political parties hold conventions in July to nominate candidates for the 2016 presidential elections. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get the report out. It‚Äôll be in the next month,‚Äù Gowdy told MSNBC in an interview, adding that he had wanted to finish the investigation last summer but hadn‚Äôt been able to get all the documents he needed from the administration. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop an investigation because an executive branch agency won‚Äôt give me documents, and we‚Äôre still owed documents,‚Äù Gowdy said, adding the report would say ‚Äúwhat we‚Äôre missing‚Äù and which agencies hadn‚Äôt reported fully. The Republican-led panel has been criticized for allowing the investigation to drag on for so long and accused of politicizing the incident. Hillary Clinton, the leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, was secretary of state at the time of the attack and Republicans have accused the State Department of being slow to hand over documents it needed.

Oklahoma governor vetoes bill to jail abortion doctors,"(Reuters) - Oklahoma‚Äôs Republican Governor Mary Fallin vetoed a bill calling for prison terms of up the three years for doctors who performed abortions, saying the legislation would not withstand a criminal constitutional legal challenge, her office said on Friday. The bill, which was approved a day earlier in the Republican-dominated legislature, would have made performing an abortion a felony. It also called for revoking the license of any doctor who conducted one. The bill allowed an exemption for an abortion necessary to save the life of the mother. ‚ÄúThe bill is so ambiguous and so vague that doctors cannot be certain what medical circumstances would be considered ‚Äònecessary to preserve the life of the mother,‚Äô‚Äù Fallin said, in a statement from her office, where she was described as ‚Äúthe most pro-life governor in the nation.‚Äù Abortion rights groups had promised a bruising legal battle if the bill were signed into law, which would have resulted in an expensive legal battle.  Cash-strapped Oklahoma is battling a $1.3 billion budget hole that has caused it to cut education funding and other state programs. Had the bill been approved, the state would have been the first to use its codes of professional conduct to implement a measure that would effectively serve as an abortion ban, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which backs abortion rights but whose data is used by both sides of the debate. Other states that have tried to impose outright abortion bans after the Supreme Court‚Äôs landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision have seen their laws struck down by courts, it said. Supporters have said the bill could withstand a legal challenge because the state was within its rights to set licensing requirement for doctors. Legal experts have said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is legal in the United States and Oklahoma must abide by the court‚Äôs decision. Since Fallin took office in 2011, Oklahoma has been one of the leaders in adding restrictions to abortions. ‚ÄúGovernor Fallin did the right thing today in vetoing this utterly unconstitutional and dangerous bill,‚Äù said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive officer of the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group.

"India's Modi to meet Obama, address Congress next month","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington next month to discuss security and other issues and the Indian leader will be granted the rare honor of addressing both houses of Congress. The White House said Obama and Modi will discuss economic growth, climate change, clean energy, and security and defense cooperation during their June 7 meeting.  It will be Modi‚Äôs fourth trip to the United States since he became prime minister in 2014.    ‚ÄúThe visit will highlight the deepening of the U.S.-India relationship in key areas,‚Äù the White House said in a statement on Friday. The two countries‚Äô partnership is seen as critical in Washington, which is seeking to counterbalance China‚Äôs increasing power.  Modi will address a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress, an opportunity extended to few foreign leaders, the day after the White House meeting, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a tweet. The invitation is a sharp turnaround for Modi, who was once barred from the United States over massacres of Muslims. Last  year there were only two joint addresses to Congress - by Pope Francis and by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, another important U.S. ally in Asia. In 2005, then-U.S. President George W. Bush‚Äôs administration denied Modi a visa, citing a 1998 U.S. law barring entry to foreigners who have committed ‚Äúparticularly severe violations of religious freedom.‚Äù More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in sectarian riots in Gujarat in 2002 when Modi had just become the state‚Äôs chief minister. Modi has denied any wrongdoing, and India‚Äôs Supreme Court in 2010 ruled there was no case. Obama, who has adopted a ‚Äúpivot to Asia‚Äù strategy and is keen to encourage a greater Indian military role in East Asia, quickly dismissed the issue by inviting Modi to the White House as soon as he called to congratulate him on winning the 2014 election. The United States is also keen to encourage greater business and trade with India. Progress has been only gradual, but in late March, the chief executive of U.S. nuclear reactor maker Westinghouse Electric said he expected to sign a deal in June to build six  reactors in India after marathon negotiations that began more than a decade ago. The deal would be the first nuclear commercial power project since the United States and India agreed in 2008 to cooperate in the civil nuclear arena.

"The very idea of a President Trump scares some, bolsters others in Asia","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúisolationist‚Äù foreign policy pronouncements are feeding insecurity in some Asian nations fearful of China‚Äôs growing power, and risk emboldening nationalists and authoritarians in the region. The real estate developer, who is very close to securing the Republican nomination for November‚Äôs presidential election, has with undiplomatic abandon challenged much of the status quo in U.S.-Asia relations. Overall, his comments have sounded like a death knell for the ‚Äúpivot to Asia‚Äù strategy adopted by President Barack Obama five years ago. Trump has said U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea should pay more toward their defense, warned he could withdraw U.S. troops from bases in Japan, and mulled whether Japan and South Korea should have their own nuclear arms. This week he told Reuters he is willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which would represent a major shift in U.S. policy.  In a television interview on Friday, Trump told MSNBC that while he was open to talks, he ‚Äúwould never go to North Korea.‚Äù  Trump has also threatened to rein in China‚Äôs big trade surplus with the United States, saying he will threaten to impose heavy duties on Chinese goods. And Trump says he will rip up and then renegotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact agreed to by the U.S., Japan, and 10 other countries in February.  Furthermore, Trump‚Äôs call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States risks undermining moderate leaders in Muslim countries like Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh. ‚ÄúIf he becomes president and adopts his own version of foreign policy, the U.S. will cease to be a Pacific power. That‚Äôs the end result,‚Äù said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat, who served in both Beijing and Baghdad.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we would adopt ‚ÄòJapan First,‚Äô but if the U.S. leaves, there will be a vacuum and ‚Ä¶ China will try to fill it,‚Äù said Miyake, research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a survival issue for all allies of the United States.‚Äù Trump could, of course, lose the election to the likely Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, who is well known by many Asia policymakers.  And if he is elected he could act much differently in office. But Asian diplomats and policy advisers say that initial impressions count. Trump‚Äôs idea of making Japan and South Korea pay up rather than enjoy a cheaper ride under the U.S. security umbrella sent shudders through Tokyo and Seoul.  Trump reiterated his stance on Friday. ‚ÄúThey have a lot of money, both of those nations,‚Äù he told MSNBC, pointing to Japan‚Äôs auto sales and South Korea‚Äôs electronics industry. ‚ÄúWe have to get reimbursed.‚Äù  In addition, his comments about the possibility of a local nuclear deterrent fanned fears among Asian diplomats that the world could become an even more dangerous place.  ‚ÄúIt is here that Trump is most scary,‚Äù Lalit Mansingh, a former Indian ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in New Delhi, though he also noted it may be ‚Äújust election rhetoric.. Japan‚Äôs nationalist-led government has already boosted defence spending and has reinterpreted its pacifist constitution to allow its military to come to the aid of allies under attack even if Japan itself if not attacked, a major shift in Japan‚Äôs post-war security stance. ‚ÄúHis position is causing anxiety, especially in East Asia,‚Äù said a senior lawmaker in Japan‚Äôs ruling coalition. ‚ÄúIt is really hard to comprehend because conservatives have supported a stronger military presence and more engagement.‚Äù Mansingh said he expects China to test the foreign policy resolve of whoever occupies the White House next, and the South China Sea looms as one of the most likely flashpoints. Tensions over China‚Äôs land-building and installations on islets in the disputed waters flared on Tuesday, when two Chinese warplanes carried out what the Pentagon called an ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù intercept of a U.S. military reconnaissance aircraft. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre building a massive fortress in the South China Sea. They‚Äôre not supposed to be doing that,‚Äù Trump told Reuters, without saying what he would do about it. At least, according to Mansingh, China‚Äôs leaders and Trump shared the mentality of dealmakers, which could help settle diplomatic wrangles before they get out of hand. Jia Qingguo, an adviser to China‚Äôs government on foreign affairs, said Trump sounds like an ‚Äúisolationist‚Äù who doesn‚Äôt want the United States to become too active internationally. ‚ÄúSo, he doesn‚Äôt sound that aggressive,‚Äù said Jia, the dean of the School of International Relations at China‚Äôs elite Peking University. ‚ÄúChinese tend to think that too much so-called internationalism on the part of the U.S. is not that good.‚Äù A senior Japanese government official said Washington could lose influence in Asia if there was any perception it was softening its stance on issues like the South China Sea. ‚ÄúAnd it would be very difficult to get it back,‚Äù he warned. Mansingh says those fears are overblown as the United States‚Äô self-interest lay in protecting access to the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  ‚ÄúWhat would American withdrawal mean? Does it want to hand over the affairs of the world to China? Would that serve anybody‚Äôs interest? I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù There are also fears that the TPP could unravel, or become worth a lot less to Asian partners, should Trump renegotiate the pact, as he has said he wants to do. The deal has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Congress, but Obama has warned that delay could allow China to steal a march through its own proposed regional trade deal with 15 other nations. ¬†¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs hard to imagine that TPP would survive a Trump presidency,‚Äù said a top trade official in a major country in the region, who declined to be more closely identified. ‚Äú‚ÄòLess intervention‚Äô would be a small benefit compared to the massive damage to the world from a USA that becomes more isolationist and more crassly commercial under Trump,‚Äù he said.  The lack of priority Trump appears to give to issues that don‚Äôt serve his ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù agenda could mean he‚Äôll soft-pedal on human rights and democratic values, some critics said. That would come at a time when generals are running Thailand, a ‚Äòstrong man‚Äô has just been elected as president of the Philippines, and Malaysia‚Äôs prime minister has silenced independent media. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope that someone on his team realizes that respect for human rights must be a core U.S. foreign policy value and not just a reality show line,‚Äù said Phil Robertson, deputy director for Human Rights Watch‚Äôs Asia division. On the other hand, Panitan Wattanayagorn, an adviser to Thailand‚Äôs defence minister, Prawit Wongsuwon, expressed confidence that Trump wouldn‚Äôt apply pressure to countries like his. ‚ÄúAll in all, if Trump arrives, the chances of stronger ties will be good because he would want allies,‚Äù said Panitan.

UK on Trump invite to 10 Downing Street: Not just yet,"LONDON/WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday that British Prime Minister David Cameron had asked him to visit, but a UK spokesman said no invitation had been extended. The apparent crossed signals were the latest sign of tension between the presumptive Republican Party nominee and the leader of a major U.S. ally, who has criticized Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump, in a morning interview with MSNBC, said Cameron extended the invitation to visit 10 Downing Street two days ago and that he ‚Äúmight do it.‚Äù He gave no other details. A spokesman for Cameron‚Äôs office said it was a longstanding practice for the prime minister to meet with the Republican and Democrat presidential nominees if they visited Britain.  ‚ÄúGiven the parties have yet to choose their nominees, there are no confirmed dates for this,‚Äù the spokesman said. However, a Downing Street source said a formal invite would not be sent out to presidential candidates.        Trump‚Äôs comments followed a transatlantic exchange between the two men over Cameron‚Äôs criticism.  In December, Cameron called Trump ‚Äúdivisive, stupid and wrong‚Äù and suggested Trump would unite Britain against him if he visited the United Kingdom.  After Trump clinched his party‚Äôs nomination this month, Cameron acknowledged the achievement but said he stood by his earlier comments and would not apologize.  Trump fired back this week, saying on Monday that he was likely not to have a good relationship with Cameron.    But the next day he said he expected to have ‚Äúa good relationship‚Äù and on Friday Trump said Cameron had invited him to London. ‚ÄúI will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he‚Äôs a nice guy. I will do just fine,‚Äù Trump told MSNBC. ‚ÄúBut they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street - and I might do it.‚Äù Cameron has said he will work with the winner of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election and is committed to maintaining the special U.S.-UK relationship, his spokesman has said. Trump‚Äôs proposed ban also drew criticism from Sadiq Khan, who was elected mayor of London this month and is the first Muslim to hold the post.

Lawmakers vote down LGBT rights measure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shouts of ‚ÄúShame, shame, shame,‚Äù erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors. The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough ‚Äúyes‚Äù votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber. But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212. All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 ‚Äúno‚Äù votes were from Republicans. Eight House members - three Republicans and five Democrats - did not vote. Lawmakers are allowed to change their vote in the few minutes between voting and the result being declared.     LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season. National politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same-sex couples violates bakers‚Äô religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people. Democrats chanted ‚ÄúShame, shame, shame,‚Äù at Republicans. ‚ÄúHouse Republicans are so committed to discriminating against LGBT Americans, that they broke regular order to force their members to reverse their votes and support Republicans‚Äô bigotry,‚Äù Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said in a statement. Republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory. Thursday‚Äôs emotionally-charged vote came hours after the House late on Wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included ‚Äúreligious freedom‚Äù language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against LGBT individuals. The House Rules committee had angered Democrats by voting along party lines late on Tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have eliminated that language. The House also backed by 265-159 a separate Democratic amendment to the spending bill that limits the display of the Confederate battle flag on flagpoles at federal veterans‚Äô cemeteries. The measure angered some conservative Republicans from southern states, who argue that the flag is a symbol of their heritage. Some lawmakers have been seeking to limit displays of the Confederate banner since a racially motivated murder of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, S.C.  last year.

"Trump's Supreme Court list: all conservative, some provocative","Scroll to the bottom of the page for an interactive graphic.¬†  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - William Pryor, in urging the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 to uphold a Texas law banning gay sex, argued against the notion that the U.S. Constitution should safeguard a person‚Äôs choice of partners.  Pryor, who then was Alabama‚Äôs attorney general and now serves on a federal appeals court, was one of 11 conservative jurists who presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has named as people he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court, if elected.  ‚ÄúA constitutional right that protects ‚Äòthe choice of one‚Äôs partner‚Äô and ‚Äòwhether and how to connect sexually‚Äô must logically extend to activities like prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest and pedophilia,‚Äù Pryor said in a legal filing to the Supreme Court.  Pryor has a record of provocative remarks, as do some others on Trump‚Äôs list. But many have established solid conservative judicial records that likely would appeal to Republicans in the Senate, which has the power to confirm Supreme Court nominees, and have steered clear of inflammatory rhetoric.  Trump‚Äôs list, unveiled on Wednesday, included judges who have indicated support for various conservative causes, range in age from 41 to 58 and hail primarily from conservative and Republican-governed states. The eight men and three women all are white.  The list‚Äôs release seems to have reassured some conservatives who may have doubted Trump would name a genuine conservative to the high court, which has a vacancy following the February death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard nothing but positive about this. People in the Senate say this is going to relieve a lot of people,‚Äù said Republican Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a key Trump supporter in the Senate.  The Republican-led Senate has refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs nominee, Merrick Garland, arguing the winner of the Nov. 8 election to determine Obama‚Äôs successor should get to fill the post. Scalia‚Äôs replacement could tip the ideological balance of the court, now evenly divided with four conservative justices and four liberals.  Don Willett of Texas is one of five state supreme court judges on the list. His job is an elected one.  ‚ÄúDon Willett helped defend the right of Texas to display the (Bible‚Äôs) Ten Commandments and fought the liberals who tried to remove the words ‚Äòunder God‚Äô from our pledge‚Äù of allegiance, his campaign said in a 2012 advertisement.  Before becoming a judge, Willett was part of Texas‚Äô legal team that won a Supreme Court battle to display the Ten Commandments on a monument in the state Capitol despite opponents‚Äô concerns that it amounted to government endorsement of a religion.  During Pryor‚Äôs stint as Alabama attorney general from 1997 to 2004, he described the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide as ‚Äúthe worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.‚Äù  Some of the judges on Trump‚Äôs list have ruled against abortion and birth control rights.  Federal appeals court judges Diane Sykes, Steven Colloton and Pryor all ruled in favor of Christian objections to the mandate under Obama‚Äôs healthcare law that health insurance covers birth control for women.  Federal appeals court judge Raymond Gruender wrote a 2012 ruling upholding a South Dakota law that requires doctors to inform patients that women who have abortions are more likely to commit suicide. Colloton, who sits on the same court, joined the opinion.  As on abortion and contraception, the U.S. Supreme Court is closely divided on the scope of the individual right to bear arms under the Constitution‚Äôs Second Amendment.  In a 2013 case, Thomas Hardiman, another federal appeals court judge, dissented when the majority on his court upheld a New Jersey law regulating the possession of handguns in public. Hardiman endorsed a broad reading of Second Amendment gun rights that would protect carrying weapons outside the home for self-defense.  The list also includes David Stras, a member of Minnesota‚Äôs Supreme Court. In 2014, that court waded into the contentious subject of when a person who is incapacitated may be taken off life support and allowed to die.  The court ruled, in the case of a 57-year-old man with irreversible brain damage, that a guardian who was given medical-consent power could authorize the removal of life-sustaining treatment when ‚Äúinterested parties‚Äù agreed it would be in the incapacitated person‚Äôs best interest.  Stras dissented, writing that because the man had already died when the case was heard, the matter was moot and the court should have stayed out of it.¬†  ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 "
Arizona governor declares victory in $3.5-billion education vote,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona voters have narrowly approved a plan to pump $3.5 billion into education coffers over the next decade and put an end to a long-running legal battle, Republican Governor Doug Ducey said late on Thursday. The measure, approved by state lawmakers and Ducey last year, provides for Arizona to tap its land trust fund and provide an additional $300 for each student, from kindergarten through 12th grade, in public and charter schools. Arizona has historically ranked near the bottom of states in funding education. The latest unofficial results from Tuesday‚Äôs special election showed the measure garnering 50.82 percent of votes cast throughout the southwestern U.S. state, and while some 30,000 votes remained to be counted, Ducey declared victory. ‚ÄúThis is a huge victory for public education in Arizona,‚Äù Ducey said in a statement. ‚ÄúAfter years of lawsuits and fighting, we are moving forward and funding our teachers, students and schools ‚Äì instead of lawyers.‚Äù Voter approval was required because the measure involved a change to the state‚Äôs constitution. The narrow margin of the result proved that a sizeable number of voters disliked the plan, said Morgan Abraham, chairman of the ‚ÄúNo‚Äù campaign. ‚ÄúThis tells me that voters want to fund education the right way, not through the trust fund, but with general funds,‚Äù Abraham said, adding that he was disappointed by the outcome of the vote. Much of the controversy during the campaign centered on the funding, with critics saying Arizona was jeopardizing its future by taking too much money from its land trust fund. About 60 percent of the new money will come from the trust fund, and the rest from the state‚Äôs general fund. The governor‚Äôs office brokered the deal in a bid to end a 2010 lawsuit by a group of school districts and organizations that charged Arizona with failing to fund mandated inflation adjustments to schools during a recent recession.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†The state‚Äôs highest court already had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and the court case was being appealed by the state at the time of the deal.

"Obama grapples with Vietnam arms ban, human rights on eve of trip","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is still grappling with a historic decision on whether to lift the U.S. arms embargo on Vietnam just days before he travels there, the White House said on Thursday, signaling that human rights concerns could be a sticking point. Support has grown within the U.S. administration and on Capitol Hill to fully remove or at least further ease the ban on weapons sales, bolstering ties between former wartime enemies Washington and Hanoi to counter a rising China. But Obama also faces stiff opposition in some quarters. Ending the embargo - something Vietnam has long sought - would sweep away one of the last major vestiges of the Vietnam War era as Obama makes his first trip there beginning on Monday. It would also anger Beijing, which condemned Obama‚Äôs partial lifting of the ban in 2014 as interference in the region. The U.S. deliberations come amid increased  tensions in the disputed South China Sea. Beijing demanded an end to U.S. surveillance in the area on Thursday after two of its fighter jets carried out what the Pentagon said was an ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù intercept of a U.S. military reconnaissance aircraft. Ben Rhodes, Obama‚Äôs deputy national security adviser, said the administration has not yet finalized a decision on lifting the three-decade-old embargo but dodged a question on when ‚Äì or even whether ‚Äì an announcement might be made soon. ‚ÄúIt will be a subject of discussion with the Vietnamese,‚Äù he told reporters in a preview of Obama‚Äôs trip, saying the president would explain his thinking to the country‚Äôs communist leadership. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that we obviously have been looking at ‚Ä¶ in the context of our broader relationship.‚Äù White House officials made clear that the final decision would be linked in part to Vietnam‚Äôs human rights situation. Concerns remain, especially among rights advocates and some U.S. lawmakers, over the government‚Äôs heavy-handedness toward political opponents and treatment of workers. There is also worry that Washington will lose some leverage if it gives up the arms embargo without securing concessions for reforms. Still, some of Obama‚Äôs aides are mindful that a failure to satisfy Vietnam‚Äôs calls for rescinding the ban could inject a sour note into a visit meant to open a new chapter in security and economic relations. Some Vietnamese officials are suspicious that the United States seeks to undermine their one-party rule. ‚ÄúWhat we want to demonstrate with this visit is a significant upgrade in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam as partners on many issues even as we have significant areas of difference,‚Äù Rhodes said. Obama, who will make stops in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, will meet Vietnam‚Äôs new president, Tran Dai Quang, as well as its new prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, and Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong. He will also meet dissidents and will deliver a speech to the Vietnamese people, Rhodes said U.S. officials say that no matter the decision on the weapons ban they expect Obama‚Äôs visit to yield tangible steps to boost military cooperation. Washington is looking for increased port visits by U.S. warships, possibly including access to the strategic port at Cam Ranh Bay, and to holding naval exercises, according to a person close to U.S. thinking on the subject.

Incoming U.N. climate chief seeks swift action: at odds with Trump,"OSLO (Reuters) - The United Nations‚Äôs incoming climate chief said on Thursday she will push for rapid action under a U.N. accord to slow global warming and expressed hopes that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will drop calls for a renegotiation if elected. Mexico‚Äôs Patricia Espinosa, a former foreign minister appointed on Wednesday to head the Bonn-based U.N. Climate Change Secretariat from July, urged all governments swiftly to ratify the 195-nation accord hammered out in Paris in December. She told Reuters that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not impossible‚Äù that the agreement, seeking to transform the global economy away from fossil fuels this century, could enter into force as early as this year, giving it strength in international law. Espinosa is at odds with Trump, who is skeptical that man-made emissions cause climate change. He told Reuters on Tuesday that he was ‚Äúnot a big fan‚Äù of the Paris accord and that ‚Äúat a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements‚Äù. Asked about Trump‚Äôs threat, Espinosa said the Paris deal was a hard-won compromise by more than 190 nations. ‚ÄúIt would not be easy for anybody to just say ‚ÄòI want to renegotiate this‚Äô,‚Äù she said. Nations who agreed in Paris range from top greenhouse gas emitters China and the United States, small island nations fearful of rising sea levels and OPEC members who depend on income from oil. Renegotiation ‚Äúis really not a scenario that in a multilateral process you can see as something feasible,‚Äù she added. Espinosa said she would be ‚Äúrespectful of everybody who has a role to play in any country‚Äù but at the same time seek to build momentum for action. Many other backers of the accord have expressed dismay at Trump‚Äôs call. The Paris Agreement will enter into force once 55 nations responsible for 55 percent of global emissions formally ratify the deal.  So far, 16 nations have ratified, accounting for just 0.03 percent of emissions. Many nations, including China and the United States which together represent 38 percent of emissions, say they will join this year.  Espinosa, 57 and now Mexico‚Äôs ambassador to Germany, will succeed Christiana Figueres of Costa Rica, who is stepping down after six years.  Espinosa said she also will seek to link action to curb climate change to all aspects of development in coming years. She agreed with Figueres, who has said governments will have to toughen existing pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit a rise in temperatures linked to more droughts, floods and rising seas. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs possible but very difficult, not reachable with the commitments we have on the table,‚Äù Espinosa said of the toughest goal in the Paris Agreement, to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

"Trump delegate indicted on weapons, child pornography charges","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Maryland man who is a delegate for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been indicted for illegally shipping explosives, owning a machine gun and producing child pornography, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. Caleb Bailey, 30, was indicted by a grand jury in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Wednesday. He was elected to be a delegate for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and is still listed as one on the state‚Äôs board of elections website.  Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, confirmed Bailey had been indicted and told Reuters the party was asking Bailey to resign from the delegation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know too much about him beyond what I‚Äôve read,‚Äù said Cluster, who declined to comment further. Bailey had hundreds of illegal weapons stored in a bunker beneath his garage, including dozens of machine guns, smokeless grenades and gas canisters, along with ready-to-eat meals, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Telephone calls and emails seeking comment from Bailey, from the Trump campaign and from the Maryland board of elections were not returned on Thursday. Trump has been working to unify the Republican party going into its presidential nominating convention in Cleveland in July. In March, a New Hampshire man who co-chaired Trump‚Äôs veterans coalition in the state was extradited to Nevada to face charges of helping organize the high-profile 2014 armed standoff with federal agents at the ranch of Cliven Bundy. The four-count indictment against Bailey alleges that he used a minor to ‚Äúengage in sexually explicit conduct to produce child pornography‚Äù and illegally owned a machine gun. Authorities became aware of Bailey after he tried to ship explosives and ammunition from Maryland to Wisconsin through the U.S. mail in February, said an affidavit filed by a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  Some of the types of cartridges Bailey was sending to Wisconsin are no longer used by the U.S. military because they are too dangerous, the law enforcement official said, so shipping them was ‚Äúnot only illegal, but posed a significant public risk.‚Äù The Wisconsin recipient is under investigation as well, according to the official. Bailey attempted to ship five such packages in total, but one broke open at the post office, prompting the facility to call law enforcement, according to the affidavit.

House seeks to tighten restrictions on Pakistan aid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are looking to use a defense policy bill to increase restrictions on military aid for Pakistan, expressing frustration with what they see as Islamabad‚Äôs failure to crack down on Afghanistan‚Äôs militant Haqqani network. The $602 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, passed by the House of Representatives late on Wednesday would block $450 million in aid to Islamabad unless it does more to fight the network, which lawmakers see as a major threat to U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  The bill requires the Pentagon to certify that Pakistan is conducting military operations to disrupt the Haqqani network, not letting the network use North Waziristan as a safe haven and actively coordinating with Afghanistan‚Äôs government to fight the network along their border. As they finalized the 2017 version of the annual bill, House members added three amendments related to Pakistan. All passed by unanimous voice vote. One added a fourth requirement to the release of the aid, that the administration certify Pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani network senior leaders and mid-level operatives. Another required that the Secretary of Defense certify  Pakistan is not using its military or any funds or equipment provided by the United States to persecute minority groups. And a third added a ‚Äúsense of Congress‚Äù that Shakil Afridi is an international hero and calls for his immediate release from prison. Afridi is a Pakistani doctor believed to have helped the CIA hunt down Osama bin Laden. Pakistan sentenced Afridi in 2012 to 33 years in jail on charges of belonging to a militant group, which he denies. That sentence was overturned and Afridi is now awaiting trial on another charge. Pakistan says its courts will decide Afridi‚Äôs fate, and has angrily criticized U.S. politicians, including Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, over calls to release him. The House version of the NDAA is not the final version of the legislation. It must be combined with a Senate bill before being sent to the White House for President Barack Obama to sign, or veto. However, there is also strong criticism of Pakistan in the Senate. This month, Senator Bob Corker used his authority as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to bar the use of any U.S. funds for Pakistan to buy American F-16 fighter jets.

"Bipartisan Puerto Rico crisis bill introduced, debt looms","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Thursday began coalescing around revised bipartisan legislation to help address Puerto Rico‚Äôs unpayable debt burden, which now threatens a full-blown humanitarian crisis. Released close to midnight on Wednesday, the House Natural Resources Committee‚Äôs revised bill includes a strong oversight board to direct how and when the island pays its bills and leaves many earlier proposals in place.  Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its roughly $70 billion in debt while trying to cope with a 45 percent poverty rate among its 3.5 million U.S. citizens. In addition, it is reeling from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry. Language allowing Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, known as a ‚Äúcram-down,‚Äù remains. The bill does not prioritize pensioners over bondholders, but the language remains muddied, one analyst surmised. ‚ÄúTonight, we introduced legislation to responsibly address the crisis in Puerto Rico. The revised bill incorporates technical refinements and input from all stakeholders,‚Äù committee Chairman Rob Bishop said in a statement. For a link to a factbox on the bill, click. While both Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives welcomed the bill after several delays, how more conservative Republican lawmakers view the legislation is an open question. A vote on the bill by the House is expected in the first week of June, ahead of a looming $1.9 billion debt payment due on July 1. In recent months, the debt crisis has threatened a deepening humanitarian crisis as hospitals close wards, social services decline and emigration saps more economic activity. ‚ÄúAfter long bipartisan negotiations, we believe we have achieved a restructuring process that can work,‚Äù U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Thursday. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who faces opposition to the bill from within his own Republican ranks, highlighted the bipartisan effort as he will need Democrat votes to get it passed. ‚ÄúRight now, the stability of the U.S. territory is in danger, as the Puerto Rican government continues to default on major loan payments. We have insisted that our response meet basic principles, and first among them is protecting taxpayers from a bailout,‚Äù Ryan said in a statement. The bill, formally known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), seeks to return the island to solvency, rebuild a base for economic growth and maintain its ability to access capital markets in the future. The White House called the bill an ‚Äúimportant first step‚Äù in creating a fair process for restructuring Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt and economy after a decade of recession. The U.S. territory‚Äôs governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, said he was encouraged by the bill but chafed at the oversight board, which he believes undermine the island‚Äôs self-governance. Choosing the members of the oversight board has been a sticking point in the talks leading up to the introduction of the bill. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Thursday he was pleased the bill includes ‚Äúrestructuring tools for Puerto Rico that are comprehensive and workable‚Äù but expressed disappointment that proposals to promote economic growth were left out of what he called a ‚Äútough bipartisan compromise.‚Äù        In the early drafts of the bill, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, said he was not satisfied, meaning a potential hurdle for passing the bill could remain. A conservative Tea Party favorite, Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, said he was reviewing the bill but told Reuters he thought a majority of Republicans would ‚Äúsupport it through both houses of Congress.‚Äù Many creditors lobbied for a bill that does not create new precedents for how they might be treated in a restructuring which would potentially set up future legal fights on the U.S. mainland that are far away from the island‚Äôs current crisis. ‚ÄúThe bill, which creates a control board and allows for bankruptcy, is highly controversial and does not definitively protect any creditors. We believe the legislation is more positive for both GO and COFINA creditors than the legislation previously under review,‚Äù wrote Heights Securities analyst Daniel Hanson. Hanson said the bill lacks clarity over the treatment of constitutionally protected bondholders versus pensioners. A local bondholder group said it supported the bill. ‚ÄúAs imperfect as it may be, the bipartisan bill is the ‚Äòpause‚Äô that is desperately needed so everyone can come together to forge a bright future for all Americans living in Puerto Rico,‚Äù said Jorge Irizarry, president of the Backyard Bondholders, which represents more than 60,000 resident bondholders in Puerto Rico.   GO, or General Obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the island and are senior to all debt, while COFINA debt is backed by sales tax revenues. ‚ÄúThis territories-clause bill, which will bring all creditors to the table and establish a strong and independent fiscal oversight board, should appeal to conservatives who were concerned about a ‚Äòbailout‚Äô or ‚Äòcontagion,‚Äô‚Äù the COFINA Senior Bondholders Ad Hoc Group said in a statement.  Investors bid up prices on Puerto Rico‚Äôs benchmark July 2035 GO debt to 66, a gain of 0.50 point in price to yield 12.797 percent, according to MSRB data. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 "
Illinois Senate passes grant program for needy college students,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Illinois Senate on Thursday earmarked $227.2 million for low-income college students whose need-based financial aid has been imperiled by the state‚Äôs 11-month budget impasse. But Republican Governor Bruce Rauner offered no sign of supporting the measure for Monetary Award Program recipients after members of his party pilloried the funding package as a ‚Äúfarce‚Äù because it did not identify a specific revenue stream to pay for it. Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelley declined to say whether the governor intends to sign or veto the legislation, saying only ‚ÄúGovernor Rauner remains committed to reaching a balanced budget alongside meaningful reforms in a bipartisan manner.‚Äù Illinois‚Äô public universities and community colleges and the MAP program have only received a fraction of what they had expected from the state since July because Rauner and the Democratic-led legislature have yet to agree on a Fiscal 2016 spending plan. A stopgap $600 million higher-education funding package enacted by Rauner last month offered some relief, but an early-May effort to appropriate an additional $454 million on top of the April total stalled in the Illinois House of Representatives after passing the Senate. In fiscal 2015, the last year in which Illinois had a full operating budget, the state appropriated $357.1 million to the MAP program. That amount provided for income-based grants of up to $4,968 to 128,399 students, the Illinois Student Assistance Commission reported.   State Senator Donne Trotter, a Chicago Democrat and the legislation‚Äôs chief sponsor, said the package would ‚Äúensure that our students can relieve themselves of some of the drama they‚Äôve been going through this year because of the inaction by this body and the governor‚Äù in passing a budget. But Republicans ripped the plan, with Senator Chapin Rose, a Republican from Mahomet, Ill., about 200 miles south of Chicago, accusing the Senate majority of ‚Äúwriting a check that it darn well knows cannot be cashed.‚Äù The Senate passed the bill 39-15, with two members voting present - enough to override any potential Rauner veto. But the 68-45 margin during a Tuesday House vote fell three votes short of a veto-proof majority, meaning Rauner could kill the measure if he chose to. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 "
Clinton calls Trump too unsteady to be president,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pivoted to a general election match-up against Republican candidate Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he is dangerously unpredictable and not qualified to be president. Confident that she is finally close to defeating U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination, Clinton turned heavy fire on Trump, who has been running about even with her in national polls of voters looking ahead to the Nov. 8 presidential election. On the Republican side, Trump promoted top aide Paul Manafort to serve as campaign manager and chief strategist, the Trump campaign said. Corey Lewandowski, the Trump aide who has been campaign manager, retains that title and will continue to oversee day-to-day operations, the campaign said. In addition, Trump has hired veteran Republican lawyer A.B. Culvahouse to help vet potential vice presidential running mates, a source close to the campaign said. In a CNN interview, Clinton used the example of the apparent downing of an EgyptAir plane from Paris to Cairo to say that Trump would lack the skills to bring together U.S. allies to respond to global threats. ‚ÄúI know how hard this job is and I know we need steadiness, as well as strength and smarts in it, and I have concluded that he is not qualified to be president of the United States,‚Äù Clinton said. Trump, the Republicans‚Äô presumptive presidential nominee, has been intensifying his criticism of Clinton by lobbing personal attacks at her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.  Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, said she would resolutely refuse to respond to Trump‚Äôs goading. ‚ÄúHe can say whatever he wants,‚Äù she said. But she said the EgyptAir crash reinforces the need for American leadership and that Trump‚Äôs proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States has sent the wrong signal to countries that Washington will need to work with in the fight against Islamic militants. ‚ÄúHe says a lot of things that are provocative, that actually make the important task of building this coalition, bringing everybody to the table and defeating terrorism more difficult,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt sends a message of disrespect and it sends a message that makes the situation inside those countries more difficult.‚Äù Clinton suggested the Democratic race was over because of her nearly insurmountable lead in delegates to the nominating convention, despite Sanders‚Äô insistence on staying in the race. ‚ÄúI will be the nominee for my party,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is already done, in effect. There is no way that I won‚Äôt be.‚Äù She said Sanders will have to eventually help her unify the Democratic Party after the prolonged nomination fight. ‚ÄúI am absolutely committed to doing my part, more than my part. But Senator Sanders has to do his part,‚Äù she said. The Sanders campaign rebuffed Clinton‚Äôs nudge to get out of the race, pointing to his recent victories. ‚ÄúIn the past three weeks voters in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton. We expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree,‚Äù Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said. Trump stepped up efforts to rally Republican loyalists behind his campaign after winning a divisive primary fight that left the party ruptured. On Capitol Hill, Manafort and other Trump aides met with conservatives in the House of Representatives who are members of the Freedom Caucus group and canvassed them for policy ideas. ‚ÄúManafort was reaching out for ideas‚Äù on policy, and several Freedom Caucus members made suggestions, said Republican Representative Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee. ‚ÄúIt went very well, it was encouraging. I think the Trump team recognizes the relevance of the Freedom Caucus, and the influence they have. I think actually, despite some early skepticism by some members, I think the (Freedom Caucus) board received Manafort and his representation of Trump very well,‚Äù DesJarlais said. Manafort also met with U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a Tea Party Republican who was a big backer of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for president. Lee has expressed some concerns about Trump‚Äôs candidacy.  A spokesman for Lee said U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a key Trump adviser, was also at the meeting.

California Senate passes gun control package,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The California Senate on Thursday passed a sweeping package of gun control bills that would require background checks for ammunition purchasers, ban possession of high-capacity magazines and establish a firearms violence research center. The bills, whose passage through the Assembly are far from assured, are at the heart of a political duel between Senate leader Kevin de Leon and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, who are proposing competing plans in advance of key election campaigns. ‚ÄúGun violence has reached epidemic proportions across our nation,‚Äù de Leon, who represents Los Angeles, said as he introduced the bills on the Senate floor on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe cannot stand by while our communities suffer from this horrific violence.‚Äù The package of eight bills would ban the possession of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds, make stealing a gun a felony, limit the lending of guns among family members, and close a loophole in the state‚Äôs assault weapons ban. It is uncertain whether the bills will pass the Assembly, where Republicans and conservative Democrats have blocked some of the same measures in the past, or be signed by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who has vetoed some gun control measures. The Senate bills were fast-tracked through the legislature this week, even as state officials are counting signatures and preparing to place on the November ballot a referendum by Newsom that would accomplish many of the same goals. The competing measures are a sore point between the two powerful politicians that could spill into the November election campaign as well as the race to replace Brown in 2018. De Leon, who said Thursday that Newsom based his ballot initiative on de Leon‚Äôs own proposals, has asked the lieutenant governor to agree to withdraw his ballot measure should the Senate bills pass. But Newsom, who is running for governor, has refused. His campaign strategist, Dan Newman, said Thursday that the initiative was more comprehensive than the legislative package and should go before voters in the fall. Newsom is expected to make the gun control initiative a centerpiece of his campaign to replace Brown in 2018, along with a proposed referendum to legalize recreational use of marijuana. De Leon has not endorsed Newsom. He is close to possible Newsom rivals in the governor‚Äôs race, including former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 "
Factbox: Puerto Rico debt crisis bill keeps oversight board,"NEW YORK/SAN JUAN (Reuters) - The U.S. House Natural Resources Committee early on Thursday released long-delayed revised legislation to address Puerto Rico‚Äôs fiscal crisis, which is threatening to become a full-blown humanitarian disaster. The bill, also known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), has two major aims: setting out a framework for restructuring the island‚Äôs $70 billion in debt and putting the island‚Äôs financial operations under the control of a federal oversight board. Severe economic decline, an accumulation of operating deficits, lack of financial transparency and management inefficiencies, combined with excessive borrowing, ‚Äúcreated a fiscal emergency in Puerto Rico,‚Äù the legislation states. Puerto Rico‚Äôs next debt payment of $1.9 billion, which its governor has said it cannot pay, is due on July 1. A vote in the House is expected the first week of June. * A Financial Oversight and Management Board, consisting of seven members appointed by the president of the United States from recommendations provided by the leaders of the U.S. House and Senate. One member is appointed at the sole discretion of the president. Appointments are due by Sept. 30, 2016. * The board has the authority to enforce balanced budgets and government reform if the Puerto Rican government fails to do so, including the sale of government assets, the consolidation of agencies and reduction of workforce.  * The board‚Äôs aims are to generate management plans that achieve fiscal responsibility, maintain access to capital markets and ensure funding for public services and pensions; and to help facilitate consensual debt restructuring talks between Puerto Rico and its bondholders. * The board will have subpoena power to seek testimony and information. Board members will not be paid a salary. * A fiscal plan should be no less than five years. It can be developed either by the governor, the Oversight Board or both in collaboration. * Neither the governor of Puerto Rico nor the island‚Äôs  legislature can exercise control over the board or pass laws that would inhibit its functioning. * The oversight board will dissolve once Puerto Rico has attained adequate and reasonable access to credit markets and achieves four consecutive fiscal years of budgetary compliance without spending more than it earned. * The bill adopts certain provisions of U.S. bankruptcy law, including giving Puerto Rico access to a court-sanctioned debt restructuring law, under which it could, in certain circumstances, impose debt cuts without creditors‚Äô consent, so-called cram-downs.¬† ¬† ¬† * The bill also empowers the oversight board to hold consensual debt restructuring talks, in hopes of reaching  ‚Äúcollective action compromises‚Äù that do not require cram-down. For a restructuring to be approved under the bill‚Äôs collective action clause, two-thirds¬†of the outstanding principal amount of the bonds in each pool of debt must vote in favor of it.¬† ¬†¬†¬† * PROMESA¬†does not directly put Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, under the bankruptcy laws enjoyed by U.S. states.¬†This addresses concerns that actions taken in the commonwealth could bleed over and affect long-standing municipal bankruptcy laws.¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†* Any prior voluntary debt restructuring agreements will be left intact. This essentially leaves in place the current voluntary restructuring agreement between creditors and PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority) ¬†¬†¬† * Certifying a restructuring of debt requires approval by five out of seven members of the oversight board. ¬†¬†¬† * The U.S. government will not pledge its full faith and credit for repaying Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt.

U.S. judge upholds Virginia's voter ID law,"RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Thursday upheld a 2013 Virginia law requiring prospective voters to show an approved photo identification before they cast their ballots. The state‚Äôs Democratic Party had challenged the law, signed by former Republican Governor Robert McDonnell, saying it was politically motivated and intended to deter young and minority voters from turning out on Election Day. ‚ÄúThe court‚Äôs mission is to judge not the wisdom of the Virginia voter ID law, but rather its constitutionality,‚Äù wrote U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson in his decision. While he noted that the measure created an ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù for potential voters who did not have drivers‚Äô licenses or other government-issued ID, he said that was not enough to strike it down. ‚ÄúWhile the merits of this voter identification law, and indeed all aspects of Virginia‚Äôs voting regime, can be reasonably debated, it remains true that Virginia has created a scheme of laws to accommodate all people in their right to vote,‚Äù Hudson wrote.  Lawyers representing the state Democratic Party said in a filing that the Republican-dominated state legislature passed the photo ID law ‚Äúto stall, if not reverse, the growing success of the Democratic Party in Virginia.‚Äù The state argued that ID was necessary to ensure that only registered voters cast ballots and to prevent voter fraud. In 2008, President Barack Obama became the first Democrat to carry Virginia in more than 40 years, in part because of turnout among black, Latino and young voters. Obama carried the state again in 2012. In the most recent statewide elections, Democrats also swept all top offices: governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. Moreover, the state‚Äôs two U.S. senators are both Democrats. Hudson acknowledged that Virginia, a former slave state, has ‚Äúan unfortunate history of racial and statutory artifice to hinder black voting.‚Äù The ruling comes a month after another federal judge upheld a similar requirement in neighboring North Carolina. A federal court this week ordered Kansas to¬†register thousands of eligible voters who have been blocked from registering. That ruling resulted from an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit filed on behalf of Kansas residents who tried to register to vote through the Kansas Department of Motor Vehicles and had been forced to provide additional documentation of citizenship.

Senate approves $1.1 billion to fight Zika virus,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An election-year fight over addressing the spreading Zika virus intensified in the U.S. Congress as the Senate on Thursday approved $1.1 billion in emergency money one day after the House of Representatives voted $622.1 million financed through cuts to existing programs. The two chambers would have to reach agreement on a spending level before they can send it to President Barack Obama, who in February requested $1.9 billion. The White House has called the House measure ‚Äúwoefully inadequate‚Äù and has threatened to veto it. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington State urged Congress to act quickly, saying, ‚ÄúThis is a public health emergency and Congress should treat it like one.‚Äù  The Senate will enter negotiations with the House with a strong hand: a bipartisan 68-30 vote in favor of the emergency funds to battle Zika, a virus that has been spreading rapidly through the Americas, with more than 100 confirmed cases in the U.S. state of Florida. However, the conservative group Heritage Action is lobbying against any Zika funding bill that is not paid for with an equal amount of spending cuts. The Senate‚Äôs funding was attached to an unrelated transportation and housing appropriations bill that also passed the chamber on Thursday. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.     Conservative Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah tried unsuccessfully to kill the Senate funding, saying the Obama administration already had enough money to deal with Zika. ‚ÄúWhat we should not do, however, is allow the Zika virus to be yet another excuse to run up the national debt,‚Äù Lee said. But Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican, countered that U.S. debt problems were rooted in the rapid growth in the cost of huge programs such as Social Security and Medicare and not so-called ‚Äúdiscretionary‚Äù spending like on Zika.

Trump identifies 11 potential Supreme Court nominees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled the names of 11 judges - eight men and three women, all white and all conservative - he would consider, if elected, to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Six of them are judges who were appointed to federal appeals courts around the country by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other five serve on various state supreme courts. Scalia‚Äôs replacement could tip the ideological balance of the court, which now is evenly divided with four conservative justices and four liberals. Scalia, who died in February, was one of the court‚Äôs most conservative justices. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to choose from, most likely from this list,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with Fox News. But Trump said he could deviate from the list and added, ‚ÄúAt a minimum we will keep people within this general realm.‚Äù  All of Trump‚Äôs 11 judges are listed as affiliated with the Federalist Society on the influential conservative legal group‚Äôs website. The organization is known as a breeding ground for conservative legal thinkers. It is unusual for a presidential candidate to release names of potential Supreme Court or Cabinet nominees before winning an election. But Trump is working to assure conservatives in his own party that, if elected president on Nov. 8, he would not appoint a liberal or moderate to the court. Trump allies had encouraged him to announce the names of potential court nominees to allay fears among conservatives wary of a Trump presidency. Trump‚Äôs list includes: Steven Colloton of Iowa, a judge on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Raymond Gruender of Missouri, also a judge on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, a judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. It also includes: Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, a judge on the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals; William Pryor of Alabama, a judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin, a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. The state supreme court jurists include: Allison Eid of Colorado; Joan Larsen of Michigan; Thomas Lee of Utah; David Stras of Minnesota; and Don Willett of Texas. Democratic President Barack Obama in March named centrist appellate court judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy. But the Republican-led Senate has refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote, insisting that Obama‚Äôs successor should get to select Scalia‚Äôs replacement.  Trump said in a statement that the 11 judges were ‚Äúrepresentative of the kind of constitutional principles I value‚Äù and said he would use the list as a guide for nominating a justice. Willett in the past year has posted several comments on Twitter mocking Trump, even referring to him as ‚ÄúDarth Trump,‚Äù a twist on the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù villain Darth Vader. Willett last June posted about imagining Trump selecting a Supreme Court nominee. ‚ÄúThe mind reels. *weeps‚Äîcan‚Äôt finish tweet*,‚Äù Willett wrote, suggesting he was crying at the idea. Asked to comment on Willett‚Äôs Twitter remarks, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, ‚ÄúMr. Trump‚Äôs sole focus is considering the best potential individuals based on their constitutional principles.‚Äù Lee is the brother of Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know everyone on the list, but those I do know would all be great Supreme Court Justices. Of course, I do believe one name on that list stands head and shoulders above the rest,‚Äù said Mike Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would consider any nomination. Sykes is the former wife of conservative Wisconsin radio host Charles Sykes, who posted on Twitter that she would make a great justice but added, ‚ÄúI simply don‚Äôt believe Trump.‚Äù Several of the judges have ruled against abortion and reproductive rights. Sykes, Colloton and Pryor have ruled against the Obama administration regarding religious objections to the contraception coverage requirement of the Obamacare healthcare law.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at his daily briefing that he would be surprised if any Democrat would describe any of Trump‚Äôs picks ‚Äúas a consensus nominee.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut the individual President Obama has put forward is somebody that Republicans have described as a consensus nominee,‚Äù Earnest said of Garland, adding that it would be wise for the Senate to act on Obama‚Äôs nominee. Liberal advocacy group People for the American Way said  Trump‚Äôs list included ‚Äúconservative dream justices.‚Äù Most of the 11 judges did not respond to requests for comment.  ‚ÄúJoan Larsen is working along with the rest of Michigan‚Äôs Supreme Court to provide common-sense, rule-of-law justice. That is her focus and will remain her focus,‚Äù her campaign spokesman Stu Sandler said. Larsen was appointed to the post and is running for election to a full term.  ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 "
"Grammar fail, or do Texas Republicans believe most Texans are gay?","AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A Texas-based LGBT advocacy helped spark a grammar debate this week over whether an errant comma in the stridently anti-homosexual Republican Party of Texas platform can be read as saying the majority of Texans are gay. The plank that was approved by delegates at the party‚Äôs convention this month reads: ‚ÄúHomosexuality is a chosen behavior that is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that has been ordained by God in the Bible, recognized by our nations founders, and shared by the majority of Texans.‚Äù Lone Star Q, which describes itself as the state‚Äôs No. 1 source for LGBT news, asked on Twitter on Wednesday to have a ‚Äúgrammar debate‚Äù over the wording. In response, grammarians pointed out that placement of the final comma in the plank could lead to understanding it to mean  that homosexuality is a chosen behavior shared by the majority of Texans. They also noted that ‚Äúnations‚Äù should have an apostrophe and that by using ‚Äúhas been,‚Äù the plank gives the impression that homosexuality has been ordained by God.  Party officials did not respond to requests to comment. The party, which dominates Texas politics, has been hostile toward homosexuality for years. Its platform has said homosexuality must not be presented as an acceptable lifestyle and gays should not be allowed to marry. Over the years, the party‚Äôs platforms have favored a number of hard-right positions, such as cutting off funding for about a dozen U.S. government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, abolishing the Federal Reserve, a return to the gold standard for the U.S. dollar and U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations.

Senate Banking committee approves two SEC nominees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Thursday approved nominees for the two vacant spots on the five-member Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the highest ranking Democrat on the committee. The nominations of Democrat Lisa Fairfax and Republican Hester Peirce now go to the full Senate. The Republican-led Congress has been slow to fill empty seats at agencies and boards, and many of the nominations made by outgoing President Barack Obama, a Democrat, have stalled. Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, the most senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, said the committee has yet to hold hearings for nominees to the Federal Reserve Board or the board of the Export-Import Bank.  ‚ÄúIt is disgraceful that the Senate still hasn‚Äôt confirmed any of the 20 nominations that the Banking Committee has received since the start of last year,‚Äù said Brown in a statement. ‚ÄúThese nominees are essential to promoting financial stability, protecting national security, and ensuring that American businesses of all sizes can compete on a level playing field with foreign competitors.‚Äù The two SEC nominees were part of a block of five nominations that were approved by a single voice vote in a room near the Senate floor.  The committee also approved Jay Lerner as inspector general of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, Amias Gerety as assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury Department and Rhett Jeppson as director of the U.S. Mint.  Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, dissented in the hastily scheduled vote in protest over the Export-Import Bank board nominees. ‚ÄúDespite the fact that Congress finally passed my bill to reauthorize the agency last December, the Ex-Im Bank has still been hamstrung from supporting American jobs and businesses because there isn‚Äôt a majority on the board,‚Äù she said in a statement. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have strong concerns with the nominees we voted on today.‚Äù  The committee attempted to approve the nominees last month, but opposition from Democrats over corporate political disclosure threw the vote into disarray. The Democrats had pressed the SEC nominees to support a requirement that corporations disclose political donations. Obama put the two names forward in October.  Peirce once worked on the Senate Banking Committee staff and then became a senior research fellow and director of the financial markets working group at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.  Fairfax is a law professor at George Washington University, and has written a primer on shareholder activism. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 "
ACLU threatens Cleveland over delays in convention protest permits,"(Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday accused the city of Cleveland of taking too long to issue permits to protesters planning demonstrations at the Republican National Convention in July and threatened to sue if the city delays further. ‚ÄúDelays by the city are effectively blocking groups from exercising their fundamental right to political expression,‚Äù  Christine Link, executive director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. ‚ÄúCleveland is using security planning as a mask to suppress political speech.‚Äù Thousands of demonstrators are expected to converge outside the convention from July 18 to 21 when presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is likely to receive the party‚Äôs nomination for the Nov. 8 general election. Raucous protests for and against the candidate have erupted at Trump events during the primary campaign. Large groups require a parade permit in Cleveland for demonstrations that would obstruct traffic or occur during special events. City spokesman Dan Williams said permits would be issued ‚Äúin time for the convention‚Äù but he declined to say what date it considered appropriate. He said he was unaware of any permits issued so far. The normal permitting process could not be expected for the convention because ‚Äúthis is not normal,‚Äù Williams said. The city of Philadelphia, which will host the Democratic convention a week later, has already begun issuing permits, and Cleveland has told protesters they should wait until two weeks before the convention, the ACLU said. Undue delays may infringe on protesters‚Äô rights to free speech, the ACLU said, suggesting a deadline of June 1. If Cleveland delays too long, the ACLU would file a lawsuit in federal court and ask for an expedited hearing, Link said in a telephone interview. Protesters need adequate time to make travel arrangements and rent needed materials such as portable toilets and sound stage equipment, Link said. The ACLU wrote on behalf of Citizens for Trump, which applied for a permit one month ago, and the liberal activist group Organize Ohio, which has been waiting two months for a permit. Citizens for Trump anticipates 104 cars and trucks, 100 motorcycles, four horses and at least 5,000 people to participate in its event, while Organize Ohio expects 3,000 to 5,000 marchers, the ACLU said. Another attorney represents an individual, John Penley, who has said the city has yet to even respond to his request for a permit application, the ACLU said. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 "

"Top Democratic senator probes SWIFT, NY Fed about Bangladesh heist","(Reuters) - The Senate Homeland Security Committee‚Äôs top Democrat sought information Thursday from global financial network SWIFT and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on steps being taken to bolster cyber security in the wake of the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh. Senator Tom Carper of Delaware requested that both answer questions and brief his staff by June 17 on how they were handling issues following the February heist, during which hackers wired money out of an account at the New York Fed held by Bank Bangladesh, as well as how they were safeguarding against other potential cyber threats. ‚ÄúThese cyber attacks raise important questions about the security of the SWIFT system and the ability of its members to prevent future attacks,‚Äù Carper wrote in his letters. The inquiry comes as policymakers, regulators and financial institutions around the world increase scrutiny into the heist at Bank Bangladesh and a separate attempt to use fraudulent SWIFT messages to steal from a commercial bank in Vietnam. The Association of Banks in Singapore told Reuters it had invited SWIFT for a meeting in June to discuss the latest cyber attacks. The Bank of England last month ordered British banks to provide documentation on SWIFT security measures.  In his letters, Carper said there appeared to be no evidence the Federal Reserve systems were penetrated or compromised in the Bangladesh attack. The New York Federal Reserve has denied responsibility for the intrusion, which some security researchers have said was due to a flaw in the SWIFT bank messaging network. The identity of the Bangladesh hackers remains unknown. Brussels-based SWIFT is a cooperative owned by some 3,000 global financial institutions. A representative for SWIFT could not immediately be reached for comment. The New York Fed plans to respond, a representative said. Carper asked SWIFT how it shares information about cyber security threats against member banks, whether there were consequences for members who did not follow security standards and if it plans to revise its cyber security policies in response to the Bangladesh attacks, among other questions. He requested similar information from the Federal Reserve, including steps it has taken to coordinate with SWIFT, Bangladesh Bank, the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Treasury since the heist. Major U.S. banks are scrutinizing security of the SWIFT messaging network following the cyber attacks, according to media reports. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 "
Clinton calls on world to break down barriers holding back girls,"COPENHAGEN (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - U.S. presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton called for renewed efforts to ‚Äúbreak down the barriers holding back women and girls around the world‚Äù on Thursday. In a video address to Women Deliver, a major women‚Äôs health and rights conference, she said gender equality must be made a priority in the drive to meet new U.N. development goals. ‚ÄúTwo decades ago at the U.N. fourth world conference on women in Beijing we came together and said with one voice that women‚Äôs rights are human rights. And the gains we‚Äôve made since then prove that progress is possible,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut as you all know too well, our work is far from finished. This is an important moment as we chart a course to meet the new Sustainable Development Goals. We have to break down the barriers holding back women and girls around the world.‚Äù More than 5,500 delegates from over 160 countries  - including world leaders, ministers, health experts, economists, business leaders, activists, royalty and celebrities - have attended the four-day conference in Copenhagen. Discussions focused on how to put girls and women at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed by world leaders last year to fight inequality and extreme poverty. ‚ÄúGender equality, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, must be a core priority,‚Äù Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in the race to the White House, said in the unscheduled video address. ‚ÄúTo get there we need greater political will and resources, and we need to continue to invest in more and better data to measure progress. ‚ÄúThe Women Deliver summit is critical to this work,‚Äù Clinton added. ‚ÄúYou carry the spirit of Beijing forward bringing in new voices and lifting up the next generation of leaders.‚Äù Mogens Lykketoft, president of the U.N. General Assembly, said he hoped a woman would become the next head of the world body when Ban Ki-moon steps down later this year. ‚ÄúIt would be symbolically and of real value very important that at the end of 2016 we will have the first ever elected female U.N. secretary general, and the first ever female president of the most powerful of nations ‚Äì the United States. ‚ÄúWhat a way to demonstrate that our shared vision can become a reality,‚Äù he said.

UAW chief says union to endorse either Clinton or Sanders 'soon',"DETROIT (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams said on Thursday the union will endorse either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders for U.S. president ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù and called for unity among Democrats behind the eventual nominee. Williams, head of the richest U.S. union, vowed that the labor group will be ‚Äúall in‚Äù to support the eventual Democratic nominee. The UAW has more than 1 million current and retired members. In a news conference at UAW headquarters, Williams did not say whether the UAW would endorse a candidate before the June 7 Democratic primary in California, but said he and top union leaders could decide quickly over the phone when the time comes to announce a decision. In early polling of UAW members, 28 percent preferred Donald Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee. Williams said the poll was conducted at a time when Trump talked about bringing jobs back to the United States and before the union distributed comments Trump made last August in a Detroit News interview when he said U.S. automakers should shift production from Michigan to states where wages could be lowered. Williams would not reveal how Clinton or Sanders fared in the early polling among UAW members when Trump received about 28 percent of the support. Williams said he did not know the current level of support among UAW members for Trump, but he indicated that he is confident most of the onetime Trump supporters would side with a Democratic candidate. Williams said the Republican Party is for ‚Äúfree trade‚Äù and not ‚Äúfair trade‚Äù and that the result of a Republican presidency would be lower wages for U.S. workers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a president that has a good line,‚Äù said the UAW chief. ‚ÄúI want to know what the detail is.‚Äù Williams said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a game show.‚Äù Separately, he said he may seek a meeting with Tesla Motors Inc‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk when he calls on other corporate leaders. Williams said he met twice with Musk five years ago, before he became UAW president in mid-2014. Tesla‚Äôs factory in Fremont, California, which is nonunion, has increased production and the number of employees greatly since then. Williams said the UAW continues to work to organize the Tesla plant but he would not give any details on how intense that effort is. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still a priority,‚Äù he said.

Senators introduce bill to block expansion of FBI hacking authority,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A small group of bipartisan senators introduced a bill Thursday that would block a pending judicial rule change allowing U.S. judges to issue search warrants for remote access to computers in any jurisdiction, even overseas, arguing the change would expand the FBI‚Äôs hacking authority. The one-page legislation from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Republican Senator Rand Paul would undo the change, adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in a private vote last month and without congressional involvement, to procedural rules governing the court system. Republican Senator Steve Daines and Democrats Tammy Baldwin and Jon Tester are co-sponsoring the Stopping Mass Hacking Act. Magistrate judges currently can only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, typically limited to a few counties. ‚ÄúThis is a dramatic expansion of the government‚Äôs hacking and surveillance authority,‚Äù Wyden said in a statement. ‚ÄúSuch a substantive change with an enormous impact on Americans‚Äô constitutional rights should be debated by Congress, not maneuvered through an obscure bureaucratic process.‚Äù Companion legislation is expected in the House soon,  Wyden‚Äôs office said. The U.S. Justice Department has pushed for the rule change since 2013 and has portrayed it as a procedural tweak needed to modernize the criminal code to pursue sophisticated 21st century criminals. Congress has until Dec. 1 to vote to reject, amend or postpone the changes to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure. If lawmakers fail to act, the change will automatically take effect, a scenario seen as likely given the short timeline.  But civil liberties groups and Alphabet‚Äôs Google  have argued the change should be properly authorized by Congress  and could violate the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Many organizations have vowed to lobby Congress intensely in the coming months to block it. The change would permit judges to issue warrants in cases where a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnot. Tensions over the FBI‚Äôs secretive hacking tools, also known as ‚Äúnetwork investigative techniques,‚Äù have played out in a number of recent cases involving the bureau‚Äôs covert seizure of a dark web child pornography website in February 2015 to track thousands of the site‚Äôs visitors. Two defendants in the investigation secured rulings last month declaring the warrants used in their cases were invalid under current limitations of Rule 41. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 "
"House lifts block on Google-hosted apps, Yahoo Mail remains blacklisted","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives‚Äô information technology team this week reinstated access on its internet network to software applications hosted on a Google cloud service after the company addressed potential security fears, according to an email seen by Reuters. Yahoo Mail remains inaccessible, however, and has been blacklisted since the House Information Security Office said in an April 30 memo it had detected an increase of ransomware attacks on the network.  The two restrictions were not related, but came within days of each other and made some communication among lawmakers and their staff more difficult, several congressional aides said. Devices connected to the House‚Äôs internet via Wi-Fi or ethernet cables were barred from accessing appspot.com, the domain where Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google hosts custom-built apps, on May 3 due to concerns about a potential security vulnerability identified publicly by the FBI in June 2015.	 ‚ÄúBased on Google‚Äôs corrective actions of removing suspicious applications from appspot.com, InfoSec has unblocked access to appspot.com on the House Network,‚Äù an email sent by the House‚Äôs technology service desk on Monday said.

"Guantanamo, rights issues in defense bill divide Congress","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee announced his opposition on Wednesday to the 2017 defense authorization bill, underscoring the partisan divide over the $602 billion defense policy measure. Representative Adam Smith said changes in the bill this week by Republicans, who control the House, on issues including women‚Äôs registration for the draft, transfers from the Guantanamo detention center and protection for gay and transgender employees of military contractors, had led him to oppose it. ‚ÄúThese have tipped the balance of the bill considerably,‚Äù Smith said in a statement. President Barack Obama had already threatened to veto the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, over a long list of issues, starting with its use of $18 billion of special war funds for day-to-day military programs to avoid automatic budget cuts. This week, the powerful House Rules Committee used a procedural move to remove, without a House vote, an amendment approved by the armed services committee that would have required women to register for the military draft. The Rules panel also decided not to allow debate on an amendment that would have stripped a ‚Äúreligious protection‚Äù measure from the bill that rights advocates fear would undo the president‚Äôs 2014 executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Smith said he also objected to Republicans‚Äô adding further restrictions on transfers from the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and reduction in funds for nuclear nonproliferation and other provisions. Republicans control 246 seats in the 435-member House, which passed the bill by a vote of 277-147 late on Wednesday, largely along party lines, with most Republicans backing the bill and most Democrats opposed. However, the Senate will pass its own version of the bill later this year, which will be reconciled with the House bill to create a final version of the legislation. Once passed by the Senate and House, that NDAA would be sent to the White House for Obama to sign into law, or veto. ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 "
House approves $622 million to combat Zika virus,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday to provide $622.1 million to control the spread of the Zika virus, far below President Barack Obama‚Äôs request and lower than Senate legislation. The bill passed the Republican-controlled House 241 to 184, largely along party lines, and sets up a confrontation with both the Republican-majority Senate and the Democratic Obama administration.  The White House has threatened to veto the House bill, saying it was ‚Äúwoefully inadequate.‚Äù The Obama administration has requested $1.9 billion. On Tuesday, the Senate cleared the way for expected approval by the chamber on Thursday of $1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects. Unlike the Senate legislation, the House bill requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts. House Republicans argue their bill, when coupled with $589 million the Obama administration already shifted to Zika from unused funds to battle Ebola, would provide enough money through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year. It was unclear how long it might take the Senate and House to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. Last year, Brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly, and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the Americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern U.S. states including Florida. The Obama administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 "
Facebook's Zuckerberg meets U.S. conservatives over bias controversy,"(Reuters) - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg heard from more than a dozen U.S. conservative leaders on Wednesday and said he will work to build trust with users who believe the social network displays politically biased news content. After a closed-door meeting at the company‚Äôs Silicon Valley headquarters, Zuckerberg defended his company‚Äôs practices but acknowledged that many conservatives believe Facebook is politically liberal.  ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense for our mission or our business to suppress political content,‚Äù Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook after the meeting.  ‚ÄúI know many conservatives don‚Äôt trust that our platform surfaces content without a political bias,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI wanted to hear their concerns personally and have an open conversation about how we can build trust. ‚Äú The editorial practices at the world‚Äôs largest social network came under scrutiny after a former Facebook contractor anonymously accused editors there of deliberately suppressing conservative news. The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo, which did not identify the ex-contractor. Facebook has denied the allegations and said it would conduct a full investigation. A Facebook spokeswoman said the meeting produced ‚Äúa constructive discussion‚Äù and some attendees called it productive. ‚ÄúI think Facebook is very sincere in wanting to resolve outstanding issues with conservatives,‚Äù Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, said after the meeting. Attendees were frank about their concerns, but the tone was cordial, Bozell said. ‚ÄúFacebook invited that frank talk. People didn‚Äôt hold back too much,‚Äù he said.     On her Facebook page, conservative CNN commentator S.E. Cupp said the meeting had produced ‚Äústrong commitments to address issues, as well as to work together on common goals.‚Äù   Other attendees included former White House press secretary Dana Perino, media personality Glenn Beck and former Republican Senator Jim DeMint. Zuckerberg said that while Silicon Valley has a reputation for being liberal, Facebook‚Äôs 1.6 billion users span every background and ideology. ‚ÄúThe reality is, conservatives and Republicans have always been an important part of Facebook,‚Äù Zuckerberg wrote. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has more Facebook fans than any other presidential candidate, he said. Fox News ‚Äúdrives more interactions on its Facebook page than any other news outlet in the world,‚Äù Zuckerberg added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even close.‚Äù  Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O). Facebook employees who donate to presidential candidates lean Democratic. Seventy-nine percent of employee contributions to 2016 contenders went to Democrats, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance data, and 21 percent to Republicans. Zuckerberg has contributed to candidates in both parties. Sixty-percent of his donations during the 2014 midterm elections went to Republicans and 40 percent to Democrats. He has not supported a presidential candidate this cycle. Although a U.S. Senate committee is investigating whether there is liberal bias in selection of trending topics, there is little chance the government will try to regulate Facebook‚Äôs practices, said Republican Senator John Thune, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any reason to believe that would be necessary,‚Äù Thune told reporters on Tuesday. Thune sent a letter to Facebook last week to demand that it explain its editorial decision-making and how stories are chosen for the ‚Äútrending topics‚Äù feature. He said his primary concern was that Facebook was potentially being deceptive about how its news feed curation algorithms work.  Facebook last week released its guidelines for choosing trending topics, but the operations of the news feed algorithm remain closely guarded. Legal experts said the government has few tools to dictate how a private company makes news decisions. ‚ÄúAs a legal matter, Facebook is not required to be even-handed,‚Äù said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ‚ÄúCongress can‚Äôt introduce something that tries to prohibit Facebook from making these kinds of choices.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 "
Democrats chide Sanders after Nevada mutiny,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Infighting dogged the Democrats on Wednesday as Bernie Sanders‚Äô campaign accused party leaders of bias against him and many Democrats urged Sanders to keep his supporters in check. The tensions after a chaotic weekend convention in Nevada emerged as Republicans begin to rally around their own outsider presidential candidate, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, in the general election. Trump, who has all but secured his party‚Äôs nomination, has turned his focus to November, outlining to Reuters on Tuesday  proposals including scrapping financial regulation and the Paris climate accords. On Wednesday, he  released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. More Democrats urged Sanders on Wednesday to take a stronger stand against his supporters‚Äô uprising in Nevada over the delegate selection process. They said he did not go far enough in condemning the unrest, which included a thrown chair, yelling and threats to convention leaders. ‚ÄúThat was the time to have sent a full-throated message to his followers: that we don‚Äôt do this kind of thing,‚Äù U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said on CNN. Democrat Barbara Boxer, the other U.S. senator from California, was at the Nevada convention and expressed her concern to Sanders in a phone call on Tuesday night.  ‚ÄúI feared for my safety and had a lot of security around me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had anything like this happen.‚Äù Sanders‚Äô campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, in a series of television interviews, accused Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, of bias against Sanders from the beginning and ‚Äúthrowing shade‚Äù on his campaign. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a tremendous amount of frustration out there and people want to have a fair process,‚Äù Weaver said on CNN. Senior U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Wasserman Schultz on Tuesdsay both also called on Sanders to do more to rein in his supporters. Sanders had said he condemned violence and harassment against individuals but framed Nevada‚Äôs incident as a warning to Democratic leaders to treat his supporters with fairness. The U.S. senator from Vermont is determined to fight on against front-runner Clinton in what has become a longer-than-expected and sometimes acrimonious battle. In contests on Tuesday, Clinton narrowly edged out Sanders in Kentucky, a state where she had not been expected to win. Sanders won Oregon, a state that played to his strengths. Democrats are faced with a delicate balancing act as long as Sanders remains in the race, needing to pivot toward Trump without taking Clinton‚Äôs nomination for granted and alienating passionate backers of Sanders. Sparring between the Sanders camp and the Democratic Party leaders over the Nevada events threatened party unity before the Democrats‚Äô national convention in July in Philadelphia. ‚ÄúUnaddressed, the toxic relationship between DNC @ @SenSanders campaign, so evident last night, could cast dark cloud over Philly convention,‚Äù David Axelrod, a former top strategist for President Barack Obama, said on Twitter. Despite having an almost unassailable lead in the number of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination, and with the  primary battle heading toward the final contests next month, Clinton will need Sanders supporters on her side in the general election. According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, what played out in Nevada is just a glimpse into the uphill battle Clinton faces in courting them. If Clinton wins the nomination, for every six Democrats who support Sanders, one will switch their allegiance to Trump in the general election and two say they would not support either candidate. Only three of every six say they would support Clinton as the party‚Äôs nominee.  Sanders‚Äô campaign has long accused party leaders of favoring Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, for the presidential nomination in the face of his unexpectedly strong primary challenge. On Saturday, his supporters in Nevada became angry at the delegate selection process, booing, yelling and hurling insults, and at least one chair, toward the convention leaders. Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman, Roberta Lange, said she and her family, including a 5-year-old grandson, have received death threats and numerous callers have disrupted her workplace. On Wednesday, Lange said she wanted Sanders to acknowledge the threats, and apologize. ‚ÄúHis statement was pretty weak,‚Äù she said on CNN. ‚ÄúUntil you say you‚Äôre sorry, until you say what happened in Nevada should not have happened and it was wrong and it was fueled by your senior campaign staff people, then that‚Äôs an apology and then I think there‚Äôs some responsibility is taken.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 "
Hackers target presidential campaigns: U.S. spy chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential campaigns face threats from hackers bent on espionage and other activity more nefarious than mere political mischief, the office of U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said on Wednesday, but did not provide details on specific intrusions. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aware that campaigns and related organizations and individuals are targeted by actors with a variety of motivations - from philosophical differences to espionage - and capabilities - from defacements to intrusions,‚Äù Clapper‚Äôs spokesman, Brian Hale, said in a statement, deferring to the FBI for details on specific incidents. Earlier, Clapper said the U.S. intelligence community had ‚Äúalready had some indications‚Äù of hacking attempts against presidential campaigns. ‚ÄúAs the campaign intensifies we‚Äôll probably have more‚Äù attacks, Clapper said at a morning event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. The hacking efforts against the campaigns are considered so serious that some congressional committees have been briefed on the activity, a government source said. ‚ÄúGiven the intense scrutiny paid to the 2016 campaign, and the broad implications for U.S. foreign policy, it‚Äôs no surprise that actors are launching cyber attacks against presidential campaigns,‚Äù Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement. The U.S. Secret Service, which is charged with protecting the presidential candidates, said in a statement that it works to prevent and detect cyber security threats and makes the candidates aware of vulnerabilities. Cyber attacks against political candidates occur in countries around the world. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obama‚Äôs campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes. U.S. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to Chinese hackers.  Matthew Prince, co-founder and chief executive of CloudFlare, which has provided internet security services to Donald Trump and other presidential candidates, said his company has seen a ‚Äúsurprisingly civil cyber landscape‚Äù in the United States compared with elections in other countries where it has worked, such as Turkey or Mexico.	 ‚ÄúWe have not seen anything (in the United States) that would suggest a level of sophistication that you would see if a nation-state actor threw its full weight behind it,‚Äù Prince said. Clapper said the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working to educate ‚Äúboth campaigns‚Äù about cyber threats, likely referring to the campaigns of Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. A U.S. security official said foreign hackers would likely seek information about a candidate‚Äôs foreign policy intentions and team and about the campaign‚Äôs internal operations. The Republican and Democratic candidates for president will begin receiving intelligence briefings after their official nominations at party conventions this summer.  Clapper said the two candidates would receive ‚Äúexactly the same‚Äù briefings. He said the sessions would not be used to try to persuade Trump to soften his stance about a proposed ban on Muslim immigration, which some national security professionals have said is counterproductive to fighting Islamic extremism. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing this for many years, it‚Äôs not designed to shape anybody‚Äôs world view,‚Äù Clapper said. Because the candidates are briefed in person, U.S. intelligence officials said they are not concerned about hackers eavesdropping on the sessions. But they are worried that Trump or Clinton might share information with aides, advisers or supporters using email systems that are less secure than those the government uses for classified information.  One official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cited Clinton‚Äôs previous use of a private email server when she was secretary of state and noted Trump‚Äôs reputation for speaking, and tweeting, off the top of his head.

Wall Street bearish on Trump's call to scrap financial reform law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banking lobbyists said on Wednesday they disagree with presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs call for a wholesale repeal of President Barack Obama‚Äôs financial reform law, even though they share his view that it is overly burdensome. U.S. banks do want changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law but after spending millions of dollars to bring themselves into compliance with it, they are wary of Trump‚Äôs call for it to be essentially scrapped. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, vowed on Tuesday to dismantle most of the law. ‚ÄúDodd Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,‚Äù he told Reuters in an interview. Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a Washington trade group, said he appreciated Trump‚Äôs interest in changes to the financial regulatory system. ‚ÄúIt certainly needs some perfecting,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo have an outright repeal of Dodd-Frank I don‚Äôt think would serve the banking industry or consumers,‚Äù Hunt said, adding that it would create a messy regulatory environment.  For instance, he said repealing Dodd-Frank would end the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created by the law, and it would be unclear which agency would take over its oversight of consumer products such as mortgages.        The wariness within the industry about gutting Dodd-Frank came as critics of Wall Street slammed Trump‚Äôs proposal as a gift to big banks. Congress passed Dodd-Frank in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. In addition to creating the new consumer agency, the law restricted banks‚Äô ability to make risky investments and gave regulators new power over Wall Street executives‚Äô pay. In addition to seeking legislative changes to Dodd-Frank, the U.S. financial industry has spent much of the last six years wielding its clout in a quieter way by trying to push regulatory agencies to implement the law in ways they consider manageable. Banks still want tweaks to the rules, such as simpler capital requirements - which limit banks‚Äô reliance on debt for funding - and carve-outs from the toughest rules for small- and mid-sized institutions. There could be risks for the banking industry should Trump or a Democratic successor to Obama push for a reopening of Dodd-Frank following the Nov. 8 election. Anger at Wall Street has been a potent theme in the election so far and resonates strongly with both Democratic and Republican voters.  One reason banks fear pushing for a complete overhaul of the Dodd-Frank law is the possibility that it could be replaced by even tighter regulations, said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Guggenheim Partners, in a note to clients on Wednesday. For instance, some bank critics on both sides of the political spectrum have called for replacing Dodd-Frank‚Äôs litany of regulations with much tougher restrictions on banks‚Äô debt. ‚ÄúThe odds favor Trump‚Äôs solution being even more onerous for large financial firms than the status quo,‚Äù Seiberg said.     A source who has advised banks on regulatory issues told Reuters that Trump‚Äôs scathing critique of Dodd-Frank far overstated the problems with the law. ‚ÄúMost thinking people in the industry would dispute these characterizations,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúAre some pieces of Dodd Frank problematic? Yes. But there is, on balance, more good than bad.‚Äù    Former U.S. Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat for whom the law is named, said Trump‚Äôs comments could backfire because of voter antipathy toward Wall Street. ‚ÄúHe says he‚Äôll be enemy of Wall Street, and he‚Äôs giving Wall street what it most wants,‚Äù Frank told Reuters.

Potential Trump high court nominee mocked him on Twitter,"(Reuters) - A Texas judge identified by Donald Trump on Wednesday as one of 11 people he would consider nominating to the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly mocked the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on social media.  Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett last month likened Trump to ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù villain Darth Vader in a Twitter post.  ""'We'll rebuild the Death Star. It'll be amazing, believe me. And the rebels will pay for it.' ‚ÄîDarth Trump,"" Willett tweeted last month with a photo of the Death Star, the giant spherical spaceship built to carry a planet-destroying weapon in the first ""Star Wars"" movie.  Willett also linked Trump to liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait till Trump rips off his face Mission Impossible-style & reveals a laughing Ruth Bader Ginsburg,‚Äù Willett posted on Twitter last August.  Last June he mocked Trump‚Äôs judgment on picking a nominee to the high court.  ‚ÄúDonald Trump haiku‚Äî Who would the Donald Name to #SCOTUS? The mind reels. *weeps‚Äîcan‚Äôt finish tweet*‚Äù tweeted Willett (@JusticeWillett) on the same day Trump launched his candidacy. SCOTUS refers to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Asked to comment on Willett‚Äôs Twitter remarks, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, ‚ÄúMr. Trump‚Äôs sole focus is considering the best potential individuals based on their constitutional principles.‚Äù  Alabama U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a key Trump backer, was asked on Fox News Channel about the judge‚Äôs Twitter posts, replying, ‚ÄúI doubt he cares.‚Äù Sessions said it was more important to ask whether Willett ‚Äúfollows the Constitution,‚Äù is a good scholar, has integrity and meets the high standards expected of a Supreme Court justice.  Willett‚Äôs enthusiastic tweeting would be a pivot from the current social media presence of Supreme Court justices. None of the eight sitting justices has a verified Twitter account.  Willett did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.  ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 "
Trump threat to renegotiate U.N. climate deal causes dismay abroad,"OSLO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump‚Äôs vow to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected U.S. president caused dismay abroad on Wednesday, with supporters of the deal saying it was in his interests to embrace a plan that seeks to end dependence on fossil fuels. U.S. insistence on renegotiation could unravel a 195-nation compromise to curb greenhouse gas emissions reached in Paris in December after fraught talks between nations as different as China, the United States, small island states and OPEC members. ‚ÄúThe Paris Agreement is as much in the United States‚Äô interests as any other country,‚Äù said Tony de Brum, ambassador for climate change of the Marshall Islands who, as his country‚Äôs foreign minister, helped broker the U.N. deal. ‚ÄúSeeking to unravel it would not only threaten the U.S. economy, damage its environment, and weaken its security, but it would do a great disservice to all of humanity,‚Äù he said. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told Reuters on Tuesday he was ‚Äúnot a big fan‚Äù of the climate accord.  He said China and other countries would not stick to the ‚Äúone-sided‚Äù deal, which seeks to transform the world economy from fossil fuels in coming decades to slow global warming. ‚ÄúI will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else,‚Äù he said. Trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business. Government officials meeting in Bonn, Germany, from May 16-26 to find ways to implement the deal, raised concerns about Trump‚Äôs comments but doubted he would take serious action. That‚Äôs because the deal imposes no real constraints on the United States - it lets all nations define their own actions for fighting climate change. President Barack Obama has promised to cut emissions by 2025, but his successors will face no penalties if they do not comply, meaning little incentive to challenge the U.N. deal. Many officials also say it is in U.S. interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions, partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels also means less air pollution, a big cause of disease. Even many nations traditionally sceptical that man-made greenhouse emissions stoke climate change, like OPEC countries, have gone along with the Paris Agreement. George David Banks, a senior climate change adviser to President George W. Bush and a Trump supporter, said Trump could try to force countries like China to pledge deeper emissions cuts by renegotiating the agreement. That‚Äôs wishful thinking, according to John Coequyt, director of green group the Sierra Club‚Äôs international climate campaigns. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get more than 190 countries to renegotiate a deal they are implementing,‚Äù he said. The Paris Agreement will formally enter into force when 55 nations representing at least 55 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it. China and the United States, representing 38 percent, say they will join this year. If the deal enters into force before the next U.S. president takes office next year, it will in theory be harder to pull out. Article 28 says any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of entry into force - the length of a U.S. presidential term. Trump‚Äôs easiest option is to neglect the deal if elected, legal experts say. Trump could ignore the targets set by Obama and promise instead to help developing nations cope with global warming. The Paris Agreement‚Äôs flexible approach, allowing all to set their own goals, is radically different from the U.N.‚Äôs 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which set mandatory targets for developed nations to cut emissions until 2012. The United States did not take part in Kyoto - President George W. Bush denounced it as an economic straitjacket that, he said, unfairly omitted targets for developing nations led by China and India. Former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who helped broker the Paris deal, said this month that the U.S. election was critical to its future. ‚ÄúIf a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption,‚Äù he said. But U.S. chief climate envoy Jonathan Pershing said last week that other nations were likely to push ahead with the Paris Agreement whoever wins the White House.  ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 "

Congress forecasters see major savings from sentencing reforms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A criminal justice bill awaiting a vote by the U.S. Senate would reduce federal prison costs by $722 million over the next 10 years by releasing thousands of federal prisoners early, congressional forecasters said on Wednesday. Federal benefits received by the newly released prisoners would increase direct spending by $251 million and reduce revenues by $8 million over the same period, according to the estimate by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. The new savings estimate buoyed supporters of the bipartisan measure to lower mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, which is central to President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to overhaul the country‚Äôs federal criminal justice system and reduce prison overcrowding.  ‚ÄúWe have an obligation to change the way we think about incarceration, and today‚Äôs CBO report shows that we have a fiscal obligation as well,‚Äù said the bill‚Äôs co-authors, U.S. senators Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, and Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, in a statement. The bill was revised last month to exclude prisoners convicted of violent crimes in an effort to garner more support among conservatives.  Still, its prospects for moving to a full Senate vote remain unclear. Some key Republican senators are reluctant to support the bill until it includes changes to ‚Äúmens rea‚Äù laws that govern criminal intent.  Parallel sentencing reforms await a floor vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. A White House study last month found that current sentencing and incarceration policies strain state budgets, take people out of the work force and pull families apart more than they reduce crime or boost the U.S. economy.

U.S. Senate set to approve $1.1 billion in Zika virus funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday cleared the way for approval of $1.1 billion in immediate funds to battle the Zika virus that is linked to birth defects, well above what is in legislation pending in the House of Representatives. By a vote of 68-29, senators limited debate on the measure, paving the way for likely Senate approval this week. Two other funding approaches failed to get enough support to advance in the Senate. Meanwhile, the White House threatened to veto a $622.1 million Zika bill poised to pass the House of Representatives later this week, saying it was ‚Äúwoefully inadequate.‚Äù Unlike the Senate legislation, the House bill also requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts. Republican Senator Roy Blunt from Missouri told reporters that the Senate measure ‚Äútrimmed this package back (from Obama‚Äôs request) to what really addresses the emergency at the time.‚Äù Democratic Senator Patty Murray from Washington, who crafted the legislation with Blunt, added, ‚ÄúWe are going to need to keep the pressure on House Republicans to set aside their partisan bill and actually get the administration the emergency resources they need.‚Äù It was unclear how long it might take the Senate and House to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. Last year, Brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the Americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern U.S. states including Florida. House Republicans argue their $622.1 million bill, when coupled with $589 million the Obama administration already shifted to Zika from unused funds to battle Ebola, would provide enough money through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year. The administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine.

Many Senate Democrats frustrated with slow U.S. Syrian refugee admissions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than half the Democrats in the Senate, including many of President Barack Obama‚Äôs strongest supporters, signed a letter to him on Wednesday urging him to move more quickly to admit Syrian refugees into the United States. Despite Obama‚Äôs pledge to admit 10,000 of the people fleeing Syria‚Äôs civil war in the year ending this September, only 1,736 have been allowed into the country so far. In contrast, more than 6,000 have been admitted from Myanmar and more than 5,000 have been admitted from Iraq. ‚ÄúWe urge your Administration to devote the necessary resources to expeditiously and safely resettle refugees from Syria,‚Äù the 27 senators wrote in the letter, which was seen by Reuters. ‚ÄúWe are deeply concerned about the slow pace of admissions for Syrian refugees in the first seven months of the fiscal year,‚Äù the letter said. The lead signers on the letter included Senator Richard Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate, and Senator Amy Klobuchar. The letter was signed by 25 other members of the Democratic caucus, including presidential candidate Bernie Sanders It requested an update on specific measures the administration plans to take to fulfill its commitment to resettle the remaining 8,264 Syrians within five months. Obama said in late April that he expected the United States to meet his goal of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees before Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. But Obama‚Äôs promise sparked a firestorm of criticism in the United States, mostly from Republicans who say that violent militants could enter the country by posing as refugees. More than 30 governors, most of them Republicans, have tried to block refugees from coming to their states. The United States has offered refuge to far fewer of the millions fleeing war in Syria and Iraq than many of its closest allies. Germany has taken in hundreds of thousands. Canada admitted 26,859 Syrian refugees between Nov. 4, 2015, and May 1, 2016. ‚ÄúOther nations, including ours, can and should do much more,‚Äù the senators said in the letter.

U.S. extends overtime pay to 4.2 million salaried workers,"(Reuters) - The Obama administration on Tuesday unveiled the final version of a long-awaited and controversial rule to extend overtime pay to 4.2 million U.S. workers, which marks one of the administration‚Äôs most significant moves to address stagnant wages.  The rule, which has drawn intense criticism from business groups and Republicans, doubles the maximum annual income a salaried worker can earn and still be automatically eligible for overtime pay from $23,660 to $47,476 and requires that threshold to be updated every three years. It takes effect Dec. 1. Officials said many workers will earn more money, an estimated total of $12 billion over the next decade, while others will work fewer hours for the same pay. ‚ÄúMore than 4 million workers are either going to be paid more or get time back to raise their family, go to school ‚Ä¶ or retrain to get a better job,‚Äù Vice President Joe Biden said during a phone call with reporters on Tuesday. The rule will likely touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy but is expected to have the greatest impact on nonprofit groups, retail companies, hotels and restaurants, which have many management workers whose salaries are below the new threshold. Business groups, which lobbied heavily against the changes, say companies will be forced to cut wages and hours and may slow hiring. The Obama administration and supporters of the new rule say the $23,660 threshold allowed companies to hold down labor costs by requiring workers with relatively low incomes to work well over 40 hours per week without additional pay. The rule will likely face legal challenges, including claims that the U.S. Labor Department flouted legal requirements for creating new regulations. Republicans in Congress have said they will move to block the rule, but they would need to overcome a veto from President Barack Obama.  The new threshold was lower than the $50,440 standard proposed by the Obama administration last year, but the last-minute change to lower it, which was widely expected, did little to appease critics.  Any federal standard above the $35,100 overtime threshold in New York, which has a high cost of living, will inhibit economic growth in more rural states in the South and Midwest, Tammy McCutchen, a Washington D.C. lawyer who works with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on Tuesday before the final rule was announced. The threshold also disappointed proponents of the new rule, including Ross Eisenbrey of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, who first pitched an overhaul to the White House in 2013. ‚ÄúIt means a million fewer employees will be helped,‚Äù he said before the rule was released.

"Democrats Clinton, Sanders split nominating contests in Oregon, Kentucky","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each picked up primary wins on Tuesday in yet another demonstration of how divided the party is in the drawn-out national race to win the nomination for November‚Äôs general election. Clinton narrowly defeated Sanders in Kentucky, a state where she was not expected to win. Sanders bested her in Oregon, a state that played to his strengths. In Kentucky, the two candidates will likely split the 55 delegates up for grabs. In Oregon, Sanders will take only a handful more of the 61 delegates that were awarded.     Clinton‚Äôs sizeable lead in delegates means it is likely she will eventually be her party‚Äôs nominee, but she remains more than 100 delegates short of sealing the deal. The Democratic primary now hits a two-week lull, with the final set major contests, including California, scheduled for June 7. Clinton, who spent the past two days campaigning in Kentucky, would like to lock up the nomination and turn her attention to the Nov. 8 general election and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Trump has begun to organize his general election campaign. On Tuesday, he signed a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee. The agreement allows him to raise $449,400 from a single donor by splitting the funds between his campaign, the RNC and state Republican parties.  Trump, who eschewed donations in the political system through the primary, has thus far insisted on mostly self-funding his campaign. The shift to a more traditional fundraising approach could draw the ire of some supporters. Trump, in an interview with Megyn Kelly that aired on Fox News Tuesday night, said he did have regrets about his actions during the Republican primary process. ‚ÄúI could have used different language in a couple of instances, but overall I‚Äôm happy with the outcome,‚Äù Trump said.  Sanders supporters became angry when Nevada state party officials chose to end their convention and block efforts to award the U.S. senator from Vermont more delegates than he initially won in the February caucus. Clinton won the caucus. The Nevada incident was a warning about the potential for fireworks at July‚Äôs Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Clinton‚Äôs campaign continued to express confidence that she would be able to unify the party. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton is grateful to the thousands of Nevadans who came out to participate in the caucuses and convention process,‚Äù Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said. ‚ÄúShe believes every voice should be heard and no one should be intimidated, harassed or threatened in this process. When the primary process is complete, our party must come together and ensure a Democrat is elected to serve as our next president,‚Äù Mook said. Sanders on Tuesday joined his supporters in criticizing the Nevada Democratic Party after Saturday‚Äôs events. One Sanders supporter threw a chair, unhappy about being blocked in a rules vote that was part of the effort to help the senator win more delegates to the national convention. Others drew chalk graffiti on a party building, while the state‚Äôs party chairwoman has been receiving death threats. Sanders framed Nevada‚Äôs incident as a warning. ‚ÄúIf the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned,‚Äù Sanders said in a statement on the Nevada incident.   Sanders - who said he condemns violence and personal harassment of individuals - leveled some of the same complaints his supporters did, arguing that state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange did not allow a headcount on a disputed rules change. He also argued that 64 delegates to the state convention were not given a hearing before being ruled ineligible. The state party disputed the Sanders campaign‚Äôs interpretation of the events. It said some delegates did not show up at the convention and others were disqualified because they were not registered as Democrats in time. ‚ÄúThe Sanders campaign is continuing to be dishonest about what happened Saturday and is failing to adequately denounce the threats of violence of his supporters,‚Äù the Nevada Democratic Party said in a statement. Sanders supporters began circulating a picture of Lange on the internet that included her cellphone number and encouraged others to contact her to express their unhappiness.  Lange said on MSNBC she had been receiving death threats, including many containing vulgar language. Public messages sent to her Twitter account included a barrage of derogatory statements. MSNBC played some of the voicemails, including one saying ‚Äúpeople like you should be hung in a public execution.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat you heard is a few of the thousands of emails and texts and Facebook messages and Twitter messages that I‚Äôve gotten,‚Äù Lange said on MSNBC. ‚ÄúThreats to my family, to my grandson, to my husband.  Sanders‚Äô continued presence in the race is prompting concerns among Clinton allies that he will damage her ability to take on Trump and hurt her in the fall.  But Sanders supporters shrug off that worry, arguing that Trump is such a flawed candidate that Clinton will easily dispatch with him if she faces him in the Nov. 8 election. Clinton‚Äôs camp seems to agree.  ‚ÄúUltimately, we are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose ‚Äî to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trump‚Äôs hands,‚Äù her campaign manager Mook said.

Clinton begins Appalachia tour in Trump-friendly coal country,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton begins a two-day tour on Monday through rural, traditionally coal-reliant parts of the eastern Appalachian region where Republican rival Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-coal, anti-trade message has resonated with economically distressed voters.  Clinton, in a move to reclaim her early pledge to focus on helping the struggling region resuscitate its economies, will meet the head of a local steel workers union, retired mine workers and others in Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio affected by declining coal and steel prices. Her pledge of more than $30 billion to help coal regions was overshadowed in March when Clinton, at an Ohio town hall, said the country would ‚Äúput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs statement was seized upon by coal industry groups and Republican lawmakers such as U.S. Senators Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, both from Kentucky, as evidence she planned to continue carrying out President Barack Obama‚Äôs regulatory ‚Äúwar‚Äù on coal. Clinton immediately sent an apology letter to Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, an early supporter, pledging to ‚Äúfocus my team and administration on bringing jobs to Appalachia‚Äù and help its residents adjust to a wave of coal company bankruptcies and changes in the U.S. energy market. Her decision to embark on an Appalachian tour is in part timed ahead of Democratic nominating contests in West Virginia on May 10 and in Kentucky on May 17 as she seeks to secure the nomination before the party‚Äôs July convention. Clinton won Ohio‚Äôs contest in mid-March, besting rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont. However, her aides say her decision to focus on the region also reflects her commitment to show voters she will work for them if elected, even if they do not support her now.  Clinton‚Äôs husband, former President Bill Clinton, campaigned on Sunday in West Virginia, encountering protests from Trump supporters and being asked about Clinton‚Äôs town hall remark and subsequent apology, according to local media reports. Manchin accompanied the former president, who is also expected to campaign in Kentucky on Tuesday. West Virginia last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996, when Bill Clinton was running for his second four-year term. He is the only Democrat who has won Kentucky since 1980. During her first presidential run, Clinton defeated Obama in the 2008 primaries in those states but lost the nomination to him. Her tour is an early move to siphon support from Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, who has called for continued coal production and dismissed environmental concerns as a policy priority. Clinton‚Äôs first stop, at a restaurant in Ashland, Kentucky, will be a discussion with the leader of a local steel workers union and several of some 600 workers who were laid off when AK Steel Holding Corp announced in October that it would idle one of its furnaces amid a supply glut and lower steel prices. Clinton last month criticized China‚Äôs announcement that it was encouraging increased steel output amid a global surplus that is driving down prices and said, if elected, she would crack down on Chinese trade practices. She will continue to Williamson, West Virginia, a once-thriving town near the state‚Äôs border with Kentucky in Mingo County, the heart of the coal-producing region. Its main streets had been dotted with empty store fronts as coal mining employment has been cut in half over the past four years. The town is now trying to reshape its economy. Clinton will meet retired mine workers there and also tour the Williamson Health and Wellness Center, which serves as the nerve center for a local program that aims to drive economic revitalization through a health-focused, local-foods movement using land once designated for mining to drive large-scale agricultural development. Aides say Clinton‚Äôs interest in the region‚Äôs economic troubles was piqued after she left the U.S. State Department in 2013. She circulated data to aides then about studies related to decreased life expectancies for less-educated white adults in Appalachia, where the decline in coal-related employment has been accompanied by a growth in opioid addiction, diabetes and other health issues. Clinton has throughout her campaign criticized attempts made by coal companies to ‚Äúshirk‚Äù the responsibility to pay healthcare benefits for retirees during bankruptcy proceedings, saying the country owes them gratitude for fueling decades of economic success.

Silicon Valley mocks Trump over his tech bubble warning,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that a dangerous financial bubble has formed in the technology industry - and Silicon Valley responded with a collective eye roll.  In a Reuters interview, the New York billionaire said technology start-ups that had never earned a profit were able to sell shares at very high prices, likening the situation to the overheated stock market in 2007. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars, so here we go again,‚Äù Trump said. Many tech watchers have repeatedly warned of a tech bubble as the number of private companies valued at $1 billion or more - known as unicorns - have soared to 163, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights. So Trump‚Äôs declaration, in the eyes of Silicon Valley‚Äôs entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, was nothing new. Investors and others took to Twitter to poke fun at Trump‚Äôs campaign slogan ‚ÄúMake America Great Again!‚Äù by repeating the phrase, ‚ÄúMake Bubbles Great Again.‚Äù     ‚ÄúFINALLY someone calls it out,‚Äù Marc Andreessen, a general partner at the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, tweeted, mocking Trump. In the interview, Trump said the high valuations that tech start-ups are able to fetch today remind him of 2007, when an overheated housing market helped drive U.S. stocks to unsustainable valuations before the bubble burst. ‚ÄúYou have a stock market that is very strange,‚Äù the presumptive Republican nominee said. ‚ÄúYou look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company, and they‚Äôre selling for so much money. And I would have said can that ever happen again? I think that could happen again.‚Äù Some startup founders rejected Trump‚Äôs generalization that all companies are burning cash and overvalued; certainly many of them are, and in the last several months a correction has started to rectify years of exuberant investments.  Still, other companies continue to raise money successfully and turn profits. ‚ÄúSo far he has been saying dumb things but they seem to be getting dumber and dumber,‚Äù Vivek Wadhwa, an entrepreneur and Stanford University fellow, told Reuters. ‚ÄúI was going to tweet (the comments) while calling Peter Thiel and saying, ‚ÄòHere is your buddy.‚Äô‚Äù Thiel, an influential investor well-known for his contrarian ideas, is one of the few Silicon Valley leaders to openly support Trump. Thiel was not immediately available for comment. ‚ÄúThere is nothing in his (Trump‚Äôs) track record to show that he has been out here and met with any technology leaders and knows this industry and knows about innovation,‚Äù said Aaron Ginn, co-founder of the Lincoln Initiative, a community that promotes libertarian and technology-friendly values.  Which is ironic, Ginn said, given how much technology - especially Twitter - has helped Trump‚Äôs campaign. ‚ÄúHe says things and does things that are made for entertainment,‚Äù Ginn said.

"Exclusive: Trump would talk to North Korea's Kim, wants to renegotiate climate accord","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday he is willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang‚Äôs nuclear program, proposing a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation. In a wide-ranging interview with Reuters, Trump also called for a renegotiation of the Paris climate accord, said he disapproved of Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs actions in eastern Ukraine, and said he would seek to dismantle most of the U.S. Dodd-Frank financial regulations if he is elected president. The presumptive Republican nominee declined to share details of his plans to deal with North Korea, but said he was open to talking to its leader.  ‚ÄúI would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him,‚Äù he said.  Asked whether he would try to talk some sense into the North Korean leader, Trump replied, ‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù  North Korea‚Äôs mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump‚Äôs remarks.     Trump, 69, also said he would press China, Pyongyang‚Äôs only major diplomatic and economic supporter, to help find a solution. ‚ÄúI would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China,‚Äù he said in the interview in his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan. ‚ÄúChina can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call.‚Äù     A Chinese official said dialogue was needed to resolve issues on the Korean peninsula. ‚ÄúChina supports direct talks and communication between the United States and North Korea. We believe this is beneficial,‚Äù Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters. Trump‚Äôs preparedness to talk directly with Kim contrasts with President Barack Obama‚Äôs policy of relying on senior U.S. officials to talk to senior North Korean officials. Obama has not engaged personally with Kim, but he has pushed for new diplomatic overtures to Iran and Cuba that produced a nuclear deal with Tehran and improved ties with Havana. Sitting at his desk with an expansive view of Central Park, Trump spoke at length about his economic and foreign policy ideas in the half-hour interview. Facing him on his desk is a framed photograph of his father, the late Fred Trump. A wall displays framed photos of Trump with various celebrities, as well as numerous magazine covers on which he has appeared. On Russia, Trump tempered past praise of Putin, saying the nice comments the Russian leader has made about him in the past would only go so far. ‚ÄúThe fact that he said good things about me doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs going to help him in a negotiation. It won‚Äôt help him at all,‚Äù he said. An adviser to Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic presidential candidate, criticized Trump‚Äôs foreign policy comments, noting they came soon after Trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with British Prime Minister David Cameron.  ‚ÄúLet me get this straight: Donald Trump insults the leader of our closest ally, then turns around and says he‚Äôd love to talk to Kim Jong Un?‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs senior foreign policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a statement. Trump ‚Äúseems to have a bizarre fascination with foreign strongmen like Putin and Kim. But his approach to foreign policy makes no sense for the rest of us,‚Äù he said. In the Reuters interview, Trump said he thought Cameron‚Äôs criticism of him was inappropriate but ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have a good relationship with him.‚Äù Trump said he is ‚Äúnot a big fan‚Äù of the Paris climate accord, which prescribes reductions in carbon emissions by more than 170 countries. He said he would want to renegotiate the deal because it treats the United States unfairly and gives favorable treatment to countries like China.  ‚ÄúI will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else,‚Äù he said. A renegotiation of the pact would be a major setback for what was hailed as the first truly global climate accord, committing both rich and poor nations to reining in the rise in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for warming the planet. Trump has been criticized for offering far fewer specific policy proposals than Clinton, his likely rival for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The New York billionaire said he planned to release a detailed policy platform in two weeks that would propose dismantling nearly all of Dodd-Frank, a package of financial reforms put in place after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. ‚ÄúDodd-Frank is a very negative force, which has developed a very bad name,‚Äù he said. Trump took a dim view of Clinton‚Äôs stated desire to put her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in charge of building up the U.S. economy.  ‚ÄúThe wife wants to make him in charge of the economy,‚Äù he said. Clinton described Trump‚Äôs idea of dismantling Dodd-Frank as reckless. ‚ÄúLatest reckless idea from Trump: gut rules on Wall Street, and leave middle-class families out to dry,‚Äù she said on Twitter. Trump said he perceived a dangerous financial bubble in the tech start-up industry, with some companies selling shares at high valuations without ever turning a profit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars,‚Äù he said. Silicon Valley investors responded on Twitter by poking fun at Trump‚Äôs campaign slogan ‚ÄúMake America Great Again!‚Äù by repeating the phrase, ‚ÄúMake Bubbles Great Again.‚Äù On the U.S. Federal Reserve, Trump said that while he eventually wants a Republican to head it, he is ‚Äúnot an enemy‚Äù of current chair Janet Yellen, who was appointed by Obama. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low-interest rate person unless inflation rears its ugly head, which can happen at some point,‚Äù he said, adding that inflation ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs happening any time soon.‚Äù     The real estate mogul said he would maintain the current level of benefits for Social Security recipients, a position championed by former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. Trump said he would not raise the retirement age or impose a sliding scale of benefits depending on income levels. Some Republican lawmakers have pushed for structural reforms to Social Security to extend its solvency. The depleted Social Security Trust Fund, Trump said, would be replenished by the increased tax revenue that would flow into the government from the higher job growth spurred by his economic policies.

Exclusive: Skeptical Trump says would renegotiate global climate deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential contender Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would renegotiate America‚Äôs role in the U.N. global climate accord, spelling potential doom for an agreement many view as a last chance to turn the tide on global warming. A pull-out by the world‚Äôs second biggest carbon-emitting country would hobble the deal reached in Paris last December by nearly 200 nations, who for the first time in more than two decades found a common vision for curbing greenhouse gas emissions. ‚ÄúI will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else,‚Äù the New York real estate mogul said in an interview with Reuters.  ‚ÄúBut those agreements are one-sided agreements and they are bad for the United States.‚Äù Trump said he did not believe China, the world‚Äôs top emitter of the carbon dioxide gas that many scientists believe is contributing to global climate change, would adhere to its pledge under the Paris deal. ‚ÄúNot a big fan because other countries don‚Äôt adhere to it, and China doesn‚Äôt adhere to it, and China‚Äôs spewing into the atmosphere,‚Äù he said. The accord to transform the world‚Äôs fossil-fuel driven economy was a potent signal to investors.  It seeks to limit a rise in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius through combined national pledges to cut emissions, and provide funding for developing nations to mitigate the damaging effects of a sea level rise and climate change. The Obama administration pledged a 26 to 28 percent domestic reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025 compared to 2005, while China promised it would halt increases in carbon emissions by 2030. Both countries have promised to ratify the deal this year. Many U.S. Republicans have found fault with the deal for overreacting to what they see as an uncertain threat. Former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who helped broker the deal, said this month that the U.S. election was critical to its future. ‚ÄúIf a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption,‚Äù he said. Trump has said that he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business. One of his energy policy advisers is a climate change skeptic, U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic contender for the White House, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030. Trump‚Äôs comment drew fire from environmental advocates. ‚ÄúThis is another example of Trump‚Äôs dangerous lack of judgment and the very real impacts it could have for all of us,‚Äù said Gene Karpinski, president of the U.S.-based environmental group League of Conservation Voters.  ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs denunciation of the Paris climate accord is not only short sighted, but would be terribly costly for America and our ability to lead the world. We cannot go backwards on this important step towards a clean energy economy that benefits all our families,‚Äù billionaire environmental financier Tom Steyer said in a statement. The Paris agreement has an article built into it meant to protect countries in the accord in the event that a new government comes in and wants to dismantle it. The clause says any nation wanting to withdraw will first have to wait four years. U.S. chief climate envoy Jonathan Pershing said last week that regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election, other countries were likely to be bound by the pact. ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 "
"Trump on North Korea, Wall Street regulation, tech stocks","NEW YORK - Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump told Reuters in a wide-ranging interview on Tuesday that he would be willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang‚Äôs nuclear program. He also called for a renegotiation of the Paris climate accord and said he would dismantle most of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations if he is elected president. Here are excerpts of the interview. On speaking to Kim Jong Un: ‚ÄúI would speak to him. I would have no problem speaking to him. At the same time, I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China. People don‚Äôt realize that. They are extracting vast billions of dollars out of our country. Billions. And we have tremendous power over China. China can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call.‚Äù On breaking up big banks:  ‚ÄúThe big banks aren‚Äôt big banks compared to other big banks. In other words if you look at the big banks in Germany or if you look at the big banks in China, I have the biggest bank in the world right downstairs four or five floors below us. ... If we make our big banks too much not big, they won‚Äôt be able to compete with the banks from China and the banks from Germany and other big banks.‚Äù On repealing Dodd-Frank:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be making a statement about this in approximately two weeks having to do with Dodd-Frank. Much of it is very bad. Much of it gives so much power to the regulators that the bankers are unable to function.‚Äù ‚ÄúDodd Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function. ... It makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop. And will there be bad loans made? Yes, but there are bad loans made now with Dodd-Frank, OK, I mean all you have to do is take a look.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe rules and regulations of Dodd Frank have made it so impossible to carry out business and to, especially with respect to lending to businesses who are going to employ a lot of people. So I‚Äôm going to make a statement about it. But Dodd-Frank ‚Äì I mean there are some things in Dodd-Frank that can stay but overall Dodd-Frank has been very bad.‚Äù On tech stocks: ‚ÄúYou have a stock market that is very strange. Could be a little bit similar to, would you say it‚Äôs nine years ago now? I guess it‚Äôs sort of nine years ago. But you know, you look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company and they‚Äôre selling for so much money. And I would have said can that ever happen again? I think that could happen again.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars. So here we go again.‚Äù On auditing the Fed:  ‚ÄúI think number one, the Federal Reserve should be audited. You know, they‚Äôre not auditing it. And so far not too many people have been able to tell me why. I‚Äôm not one that says we should get rid of the Federal Reserve because I think the Federal Reserve has an important function, but it should certainly be audited and ... we should at least watch what they‚Äôre doing from the dollar standpoint.‚Äù On timing for audit-the-Fed legislation:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my highest priority. I have other priorities like rebuild our military. ... It‚Äôs not my number one priority. But certainly it‚Äôs one of the things that we‚Äôll be doing.‚Äù On replacing Fed Chair Janet Yellen:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low interest rate person, unless inflation rears its ugly head, which could happen at some point. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs happening any time soon. I don‚Äôt think I want to at this point - I mean, number one, she‚Äôs got time left.‚Äù ‚ÄúI would rather have a Republican in the position, but I am not the enemy of Janet Yellen. ... Look, if interest rates were raised and if the dollar went up more, we‚Äôd be doing no business. We‚Äôre being killed by other countries devaluing their currencies.‚Äù On the Paris accords: ‚ÄúNot a big fan. No. Not a big fan because other countries don‚Äôt adhere to it and China doesn‚Äôt adhere to it, and China‚Äôs spewing into the atmosphere.‚Äù ‚ÄúTake a look at China with certain agreements where they have to do it within 30 years, and we have to do it almost immediately. You understand what I mean by that? The agreements are not fair agreements, number one. And I would say that I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum, I will be renegotiating those agreements. At a minimum. Ok? And at a maximum, I may do something else. But those agreements are one-sided agreements, and they‚Äôre bad for the United States.‚Äù On devaluation of the yuan: ‚ÄúChina was in big trouble a year ago, now all of a sudden they cut their currency. They‚Äôre taking more business out of the United States. ... China, whenever they have a problem, they devalue their currency. And they take more money out of the United States. Jobs, money, product.‚Äù Trade: ‚ÄúWe cannot allow China and other countries to rip the soul out of our country. And they will understand that.‚Äù South China Sea: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre building a massive fortress in the South China Sea. They‚Äôre not supposed to be doing that.‚Äù  On Russian presence in Ukraine: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt like it at all.‚Äù On Russian President Vladimir Putin: ‚ÄúPutin made very nice statements about me. Very strong, very nice statements. I think that‚Äôs not a bad thing, that‚Äôs a good thing.  I think I‚Äôll have a good relationship with Russia, and I may not. And the fact that he‚Äôs said good things about me doesn‚Äôt mean that, you know, it‚Äôs going to help him in a negotiation. It won‚Äôt help him at all. And I‚Äôll know pretty soon in whether or not I‚Äôll have a good relationship with Russia. But wouldn‚Äôt it be wonderful if we actually did have a good relationship with foreign countries as opposed to the way they‚Äôre treating us now?‚Äù ‚ÄúEveryone knows. You know on Nov. 1, they‚Äôre going to announce new - the numbers are going to come out for Obamacare. They are going to be catastrophic.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beyond terrible healthcare. And Obamacare in ‚Äò17 collapses. Don‚Äôt forget, Obama pushed everything to ‚Äò17 because he‚Äôll be out on the golf course. He‚Äôll be playing a nice round of golf someplace. Obamacare is part of the bubble problem. Now, we‚Äôre going to terminate Obamacare, and we‚Äôre going to replace it with something much better and much less expensive.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, the lines are very important. The lines meaning the state borders. These people are protected from competition. And you go to these states and they have - it‚Äôs almost like a monopoly in many of the states. You have to get rid of the lines. And they almost did it with Obamacare. It almost worked out. ‚Äú ‚ÄúI think that Medicaid should be sent to the states. Ok? Let them work it.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very important that we protect Social Security and our Medicare without cuts. And I‚Äôm the only Republican that says that.‚Äù   ‚ÄúI think he was inappropriate.

Trump preparing plan to dismantle Obama's Wall Street reform law,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday that sweeping financial reforms put in place under President Barack Obama were harming the economy and he would dismantle nearly all of them. Trump told Reuters in an interview that he would release a plan in about two weeks for overhauling the 2010 financial regulatory law known as Dodd-Frank. ‚ÄúDodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,‚Äù the presumptive Republican nominee said. ‚ÄúIt makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop.‚Äù Pressed on the extent of the changes he wanted to make, Trump said, ‚Äúit will be close to dismantling of Dodd-Frank.‚Äù Reacting on Twitter to Trump‚Äôs comment, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called it a ‚Äúreckless idea‚Äù that would ‚Äúleave middle-class families out to dry.‚Äù Dodd-Frank, passed in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, forced U.S. banks to reduce their reliance on debt for funding and to craft ‚Äúliving wills,‚Äù or blueprints for winding them down in a crisis. The law created a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to oversee consumer financial products such as mortgages and gave regulators new powers over large non-bank financial companies. Republicans in Congress have pushed to ease the requirements on small- and medium-sized banks and to make it more difficult for regulators to introduce new rules. They have also argued for getting rid of the consumer financial protection agency. Banks and other financial firms have spent six years and millions of dollars adjusting their operations to comply with the law. Bank lobbyists have generally pushed for changes to make complying easier, rather than a wholesale rewrite. ‚ÄúEvery law can be improved, and Dodd-Frank is no exception. Sometimes there are drafting errors. Sometimes a good idea in theory turns out to be unworkable after a closer look in the light of day,‚Äù said John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association. Alison Hawkins, a spokesman for the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington-based financial industry trade group, said the group wanted to know more about Trump‚Äôs plan, and added ‚Äúsome fixes to Dodd-Frank will benefit consumers and the economy.‚Äù On Capitol Hill, Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, plans to release his own financial regulation plan in the coming weeks, according to his spokeswoman, Sarah Rozier. ‚ÄúMr. Trump is right, Dodd-Frank isn‚Äôt working,‚Äù Rozier said. She added that Hensarling, who has endorsed Trump, has not discussed his plan with any of the presidential candidates. But Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a group that favors tighter regulation of Wall Street, said Trump‚Äôs plan would be ‚Äúa slap in the face to the American people who have suffered so much from the 2008 crash.‚Äù Trump declined to offer specifics on his plan, but said it would address whether institutions should separate commercial banking activities from investment banking. He said even under the new plan, the banking system would not be perfect.  ‚ÄúWill there be bad loans made? Yes. But there are bad loans made now with Dodd-Frank,‚Äù Trump said. Trump was reluctant to discuss specifics on his ideas for the economy before his upcoming speech, but he praised Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, saying he approved of her decision to keep interest rates low. Trump has said in the past he would replace Yellen once her term as Fed chair ended. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job,‚Äù he told Reuters. ‚ÄúI would rather have a Republican in the position but I am not the enemy of Janet Yellen.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 "

Senate backs Fanning as Army secretary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate unanimously backed President Barack Obama‚Äôs nomination of Eric Fanning as secretary of the Army on Tuesday, making him the first openly gay leader of a U.S. military service branch. Fanning was previously undersecretary of the Air Force and chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Fanning was confirmed by unanimous voice vote, eight months following his nomination, after Senator Pat Roberts said Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told him that it was now too late for the administration to transfer prisoners from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Roberts‚Äô home state, Kansas. Work did not confirm Roberts‚Äô account of that conversation, saying that no option was off the table. ‚ÄúI explained to Senator Roberts that we are trying to achieve the goal of closure with the support of Congress and we recognize that there is limited time left to achieve that support, both in terms of lifting Congressional restrictions and winning approval of funds to execute closure,‚Äù Work said in a statement.  Roberts had held up Fanning‚Äôs nomination for months to  underscore his opposition to any possible transfer of detainees. His opposition had frustrated fellow Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a strong supporter of Fanning‚Äôs nomination. On Tuesday, McCain and Roberts appeared in the Senate together as Roberts announced that he had released his ‚Äúhold‚Äù on Fanning and spoken to Fanning. McCain noted that this year‚Äôs National Defense Authorization Act ensures that the Obama administration does not have the authority to release or transfer Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. mainland. Roberts said Work told him during a meeting last week that he would be unable to fulfill an order to move Guantanamo detainees to the United States before Obama leaves office in January 2017. ‚ÄúThe clock has run out for the president,‚Äù Roberts said.

Judges rule Trump University can appeal to New York's highest court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York appeals court issued a ruling on Tuesday that apparently made it highly unlikely that a state fraud case against Trump University, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs venture, will be heard before the Nov. 8 general election. The mid-level appeals court ruled that Trump‚Äôs lawyers can argue to the state‚Äôs highest court that the fraud claims against Trump University brought by the state attorney general should be dismissed.  Trump suffered a legal setback in the case in March when the appeals court allowed multimillion-dollar fraud claims against the now-defunct venture to proceed.  The claims are part of a state lawsuit filed in 2013 that accuses Trump University of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn the billionaire businessman‚Äôs real estate investment strategies. The trial judge in the case had been waiting to hear whether the mid-level appeals court, the Appellate Division, First Department, in Manhattan, would give Trump permission to go to the state‚Äôs highest court, the Court of Appeals. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no surprise that Donald Trump is using every legal option to avoid standing trial for operating a sham for-profit university,‚Äù New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement responding to the ruling.  ‚ÄúAs our lawsuit makes clear, Mr. Trump‚Äôs phony university defrauded thousands of students through an illicit scheme that cost them millions of dollars,‚Äù Schneiderman continued. ‚ÄúI am confident that the Court of Appeals will agree with the lower court‚Äôs unanimous decision to reject virtually all of Mr. Trump‚Äôs claims.‚Äù Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said, ‚ÄúWe are pleased with the court‚Äôs decision and look forward to going to the Court of Appeals.‚Äù Garten has said the claims are ‚Äúwithout merit and baseless‚Äù and that almost all those who participated in the programs filled out written surveys giving the seminars high ratings. Class actions are pending in California on similar claims by Trump University students. One of those cases is scheduled for trial on Nov. 28. The fraud claims against Trump University were an issue early in the Republican primary campaign.  With Trump allowed to appeal the pretrial rulings to the state‚Äôs highest court, it is very unlikely the New York case will be resolved before November‚Äôs election. It takes an average of 12 months from the time an appeal is allowed for the Court of Appeals to hear oral arguments in a case, according to court spokesman Gary Spencer.

Donald Trump files disclosure of $10 billion in net worth,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump has filed a new personal financial disclosure form that details a net worth of more than $10 billion, the Republican presidential candidate‚Äôs campaign said on Tuesday. The party‚Äôs presumptive nominee has refused so far to release his income tax statements, which are normally released by presidential candidates. That decision has drawn criticism from likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  The personal disclosure form is identical to one Trump filed shortly after announcing his candidacy last year. Critics have said the billionaire real estate developer is inflating his net worth in the forms and that his tax documents would provide a more accurate depiction of how much money he has. ‚ÄúI have built an incredible company and have accumulated one of the greatest portfolios of real estate assets, many of which are considered to be among the finest and most iconic properties in the world,‚Äù Trump said in a statement about his disclosure.

House drops military draft requirement for women,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives stripped a requirement that women register for the military draft from a sweeping annual defense policy bill on Tuesday, but supporters of the provision said they would keep pushing for its passage. Democrats accused the committee‚Äôs Republican leaders of using an underhanded ploy to undercut the House Armed Services Committee, which had approved the amendment, and avoid what could be a difficult vote for some party members. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to subject their members to a vote on equality for women,‚Äù Representative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, told reporters. Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the amendment was removed because it violated House budget rules due to the cost of  registering women. He said it was replaced with an amendment calling for a broad review of the Selective Service. The House Rules Committee set up removal of the amendment from the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, during a meeting late on Monday. It was taken out of the bill via a procedural vote on Tuesday afternoon. But the effort is not dead. The Senate Armed Services Committee included a similar amendment in its version of the NDAA, and it has bipartisan support in the Senate. The Senate‚Äôs Republican Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said he believed women should register, although he did not expect the country to reinstate the draft. ‚ÄúGiven where we are today with women in the military performing virtually all kinds of functions, I personally think it would be appropriate for them to register just like men do,‚Äù McConnell told a news conference. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced last year that all combat positions would be open to women, which immediately prompted calls that women also should be required to register. That worried some social conservatives uncomfortable with the blurring of men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs traditional roles in society. The U.S. military has been an all-volunteer force since the 1970s, but young men have been required to sign up for the Selective Service in case the draft is reactivated.     To become law as part of the NDAA, a version of the defense bill with the amendment would have to be approved by the full House and Senate, and signed by President Barack Obama.

"Obama speaks to Philippines' president-elect, stresses human rights","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama called incoming Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday to congratulate him on his election win, stressing that their countries‚Äô alliance was based on a commitment to human rights and the rule of law, the White House said. U.S. officials have signaled that Washington is ready to work with Duterte despite allegations of human rights abuses in the city he led as mayor for over two decades. Obama‚Äôs deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told a Washington seminar earlier on Tuesday that the U.S. administration was aware there was some ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù surrounding Duterte and ‚Äústatements that drew attention in the past,‚Äù but he did not elaborate. Obama offered his congratulations to Duterte as the ‚Äúpresumptive president-elect.‚Äù He won the largest share of the votes in a May 9 presidential election, according to an unofficial count by a poll watchdog, although the official result has yet to be confirmed. Obama ‚Äúhighlighted the enduring values that underpin our thriving alliance ... and the longstanding ties between our two peoples, including our shared commitments to democracy, human rights, rule of law, and inclusive economic growth,‚Äù the White House said. Washington hoped ‚Äúto build on progress made with the last administration‚Äù in the Philippines, Rhodes said. ‚ÄúThis is a new government and we‚Äôll want to hear from them directly what their priorities are,‚Äù he said when asked about the election, adding that Washington wanted to see continued efforts to respect the rule of law and combat corruption. Duterte has been criticized for allowing a spree of vigilante killings under his administration in Davao city, and critics fear he could let them happen on a larger scale as president. He has denied ordering any of the killings, but has not condemned them. Washington has steered clear of the controversy, however, which analysts say reflects the reality of U.S. national security interests given China‚Äôs increasingly assertive stance in Asia and maritime disputes in the South China Sea. Duterte‚Äôs vows to restore law and order resonated with voters, but his incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many people. Rhodes noted U.S. support for Manila efforts to resolve its territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea through international arbitration, and a recent deal allowing a greater U.S. military presence in the Philippines.  ‚ÄúWe believe that now as much as ever it‚Äôs important that the U.S. and Philippines are seen working together,‚Äù he said. The U.S. stance on Duterte could echo its approach toward India‚Äôs Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At one point, Modi was unable to obtain a U.S. visa because of concerns about sectarian riots in the state of Gujarat when he was chief minister, but was later invited to the White House when he became prime minister.

White House defends deportations after Democratic complaints,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday defended its deportation policy after complaints from Democratic presidential candidates and congressional leaders that a sweep targeting Central American illegal immigrants is inhumane. Reuters reported on Thursday that U.S. immigration officials plan a month-long series of raids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally. White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged that the deportation operations were consistent with President Barack Obama‚Äôs policy to focus on deporting criminals and recent immigrants who crossed the U.S. border illegally after Jan. 1, 2014. ‚ÄúNo one is removed if they have an ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief,‚Äù Earnest told reporters at a briefing. ‚ÄúIf this serves to discourage people from considering to make this journey, that would be a good thing,‚Äù Earnest said. In 2014, a wave of children fleeing violence in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala surged across the U.S. border, inflaming the debate over how to deal with the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The planned new raids are in response to a renewed surge of illegal entries by Central American women traveling with their children. In January, immigration officers rounded up 121 people, mostly women and children, in three states. That sparked criticism from Democrats running to replace Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential elections. On Thursday, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton reiterated her concerns about the new plans. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities,‚Äù Clinton said. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders said he opposed ‚Äúthe painful and inhumane business of locking up and deporting families‚Äù trying to escape violence in other countries. In Congress, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called on Obama to reconsider the plans and focus on addressing the instability in Central America. Democratic representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a critic of the Obama administration‚Äôs deportation policies, complained the administration was leaking word of the deportations to scare people away from coming to the United States. ‚ÄúThe last time they did this, people called my office about raids that were not existent because it creates panic, it creates fear, it‚Äôs terrible, it‚Äôs a terrible way to bring about policy on this issue,‚Äù Gutierrez told reporters. ‚ÄúStop talking about them as illegal immigrants.

Senate passes bill allowing 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia‚Äôs government for damages, setting up a potential showdown with the White House, which has threatened a veto. The Saudis, who deny responsibility for the 2001 attacks, strongly object to the bill. They had said they might sell up to $750 billion in U.S. securities and other American assets in retaliation if it became law. The ‚ÄúJustice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,‚Äù or JASTA, passed the Senate by unanimous voice vote. It must next be taken up by the U.S. House of Representatives, where the Judiciary Committee intends to hold a hearing on the measure in the near future, a committee aide said. If it became law, JASTA would remove the sovereign immunity, preventing lawsuits against governments, for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. It would allow survivors of the attacks, and relatives of those killed in the attacks, to seek damages from other countries. In this case, it would allow lawsuits to proceed in federal court in New York as lawyers try to prove that the Saudis were involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir has said his country‚Äôs objection to the bill is based on principles of international relations. ‚ÄúWhat (Congress is) doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle,‚Äù he said in a statement on Tuesday. James Kreindler, a prominent trial lawyer who represents 9/11 families and won large payouts for the victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan American Airways Flight 103 over Scotland, said he expected the bill to pass the House and become law. ‚ÄúIt would be crazy for (President Barack) Obama to veto bipartisan legislation (which would) open (U.S.) courts to victims of the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history,‚Äù Kreindler said. Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat and a JASTA co-sponsor, said the bill is overdue. ‚ÄúToday the Senate has spoken loudly and unanimously that the families of victims of terrorist attacks should be able to hold the perpetrators, even if it‚Äôs a country, a nation, accountable,‚Äù Schumer told a news conference. Republican Senator John Cornyn, also a sponsor of the bill, said JASTA does not target the Saudis, although he alluded to a still-classified section of a report on the Sept. 11 attacks that Saudi critics say might implicate Riyadh. ‚ÄúWe have yet to see the 28 pages that have not been yet released about the 9/11 report, and that may well be instructive,‚Äù Cornyn said at the news conference. Other lawmakers who have seen the 28 pages have said releasing them would quiet such rumors. Cornyn said it was up to the court to decide whether the Saudis were liable. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that this will be destructive of the relationship that we have with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,‚Äù he said. The White House said Obama still plans to veto JASTA. ‚ÄúThis legislation would change long-standing, international law regarding sovereign immunity,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a daily press briefing. ‚ÄúAnd the president of the United States continues to harbor serious concerns that this legislation would make the United States vulnerable in other court systems around the world.‚Äù Asked if Senate Democrats would back a veto, Schumer said he would vote against Obama. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who had opposed the bill, said the version passed on Tuesday eased his worries that it might leave U.S. allies more vulnerable to lawsuits, for example if groups based within their borders but not supported by their governments were behind a terrorist attack. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to alienate allies, but we do want to create redress if a nation-state was involved in helping a terrorist organization attack American interests, and I think they should be held liable,‚Äù Graham said in a brief interview.

Cutting Pentagon's acquisition chief post may raise costs: Carter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A proposal by a U.S. Senate committee to cancel the Defense Department position of acquisition chief could lead to an increase in costs, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Tuesday. The Senate Armed Services Committee‚Äôs version of the National Defense Authorization Act aims to cancel the position of under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics because it slows innovation.  The committee is proposing to divide the responsibilities between a new office in the Pentagon that deals with research and another which would address business management. If the acquisition chief position, currently held by Frank Kendall, was cut, it would separate research and engineering from manufacturing and could derail progress made on lowering growth in contract costs over the last three decades, Carter said at the Sea-Air-Space conference. ‚ÄúSeparating these functions makes no sense, as procurement and sustainment costs are controlled by decisions made during development,‚Äù Carter said. The proposal still has to take a number of steps before it becomes law. The Senate version of the defense bill must be reconciled with the House‚Äôs version before being voted on in both chambers. If passed, that version would be sent to the White House for President Barack Obama‚Äôs signature, or veto.     On Monday, the White House said it would veto the House‚Äôs version of the bill because it would shift $18 billion of wartime Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs.

Appeals court delays release of NJ's 'Bridgegate' co-conspirators list,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday postponed a deadline for prosecutors in New Jersey to reveal a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the so-called ‚ÄúBridgegate‚Äù criminal case involving allies of Governor Chris Christie. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a last-minute emergency request from one of the people on the list, less than two hours before U.S. prosecutors were set to file the names in federal court in New Jersey. The document could make clear how many Christie associates were aware of an alleged scheme to close down lanes at the George Washington Bridge in what prosecutors claim was an act of political retribution against a local mayor. Christie, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for his party‚Äôs presidential nomination this year, has denied knowledge of the plot. U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton had ordered the list made public at the request of several media companies. But one of the alleged co-conspirators anonymously filed an emergency appeal, arguing his reputation will be irreparably besmirched. In a brief order, the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia scheduled a hearing for June 6. The court is also considering whether that hearing should be closed to the public, presumably to preserve the individual‚Äôs anonymity.     The unindicted co-conspirators are those who prosecutors believe joined in the plot but have not been criminally charged. Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for the media companies, said in an email, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking forward to making our case before the full 3rd Circuit panel that the public has a First Amendment right to see the list of unindicted co-conspirators.‚Äù Thus far, three people have been charged. William Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Kelly, Christie‚Äôs former deputy chief of staff, are scheduled to face trial in September. David Wildstein, also a former official at the Port Authority, the agency that oversees major transportation facilities in the New York City area, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating. Prosecutors say they orchestrated the September 2013 lane closure in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as payback against the Democratic mayor for refusing to endorse Christie‚Äôs re-election bid. The ensuing traffic wreaked havoc in town, causing massive delays and impeding emergency responders. The case has proven embarrassing for Christie, who is heading presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs transition team.

New Jersey governor's race opens as Christie's approval slumps,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The race to succeed Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie got under way this week when a former Goldman Sachs executive entered the ring as the first Democratic contender to succeed Christie, whose popularity has slumped. Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and U.S. ambassador to Germany who has never held elected office, is seeking the Democratic nomination for the gubernatorial  election in November 2017.  Christie, who is not eligible to run for a third term, won the governorship in 2009, when he beat one-term Democrat Jon Corzine, also formerly of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Murphy, who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany until 2013, said he would focus on issues such as equal pay for women and a higher minimum wage - legislative initiatives that Christie has either already vetoed and is expected to veto.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for a governor who has your back. I will,‚Äù promised Murphy, 58, in a campaign ad released on Monday. He is a married father of four who lives in Middletown and retired in 2006 after 23 years at the Wall Street investment bank. Political observers say other possible candidates include Democrats such as state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop and Republicans such as Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick, state Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr and Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno. Christie has seen his approval ratings fall to fresh lows in recent weeks. He has been tarnished by the ‚ÄúBridgegate‚Äù scandal and criticized as a no-show leader preoccupied first with his own presidential campaign and when that failed, with role as a top adviser to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. ‚ÄúHis approval ratings are terrible. They have been low and keep going down. He will leave unpopular,‚Äù said Julian Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University. A poll of New Jersey voters last month showed 31 percent approve and 63 percent disapprove of Christie‚Äôs performance as governor, said John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics. Voters will likely seek a candidate very different from Christie, Zelizer said, particularly on transparency and righting the state‚Äôs finances.  ‚ÄúThey are looking for someone who is antithetical to him. Someone they can trust, someone who is devoted to the state, and someone who seems clean and immune from scandal,‚Äù Zelizer said. ‚ÄúThey want a governor who will bring in new kinds of industry and new pockets of growth.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 "

California Democrats dueling over gun control plans,"SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - Two of the most powerful politicians in California are advancing the same basic gun control agenda ‚Äì yet they are at loggerheads in a political duel that could preview an ugly race to replace the state‚Äôs popular Democratic governor, Jerry Brown. The spat among ambitious Democrats took a serious turn this week, as Senate leader Kevin de Leon aggressively moved to push a package of gun control bills through the legislature that, if passed, would largely render irrelevant a firearms referendum by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom aimed at the November ballot. ‚ÄúThey both want tougher gun laws in California and they both want credit for it,‚Äù said Dan Schnur, a former Republican strategist who now heads the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. Both efforts would prohibit possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, require greater scrutiny of ammunition purchasers and seek to better keep guns out of the hands of violent felons. The legislative package, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee on Monday and will go before the full body on Thursday, also seeks to eliminate a loophole in an existing law prohibiting weapons with detachable ammunition magazines. Newsom, who is running to replace Brown in the 2018 gubernatorial election, is expected to make the gun control measure a centerpiece of his campaign, along with a proposed ballot initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.   But de Leon has not endorsed him. Last year, shortly after Newsom announced his gun control referendum, de Leon reduced the number of legislative staff working in the lieutenant governor‚Äôs office. De Leon, who represents Los Angeles, is close to possible Newsom rivals in the governor‚Äôs race, including former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.  He has asked Newsom to agree to withdraw his ballot measure if the Senate package passes, but Newsom has refused. ‚ÄúThe initiative process is a blunt instrument and should always be the last resort - not the first,‚Äù de Leon said in an email on Monday. ‚ÄúIt would be preferable to achieve policymaking on such a complex issue as gun control through the legislative process.‚Äù De Leon is also concerned that the ballot campaign would be expensive, drawing political contributions from pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association and potentially causing Democrats in moderate and conservative districts to lose elections, a source close to him said. But Newsom said in a letter to de Leon shared with Reuters that his initiative was more comprehensive than the Senate package, tackling topics that had stalled repeatedly in the legislature. Dan Newman, Newsom‚Äôs campaign strategist, said concerns about gun violence, not politics, motivated the lieutenant governor. ‚ÄúHe will get plenty of exposure this fall via his support for the marijuana initiative and Hillary for President,‚Äù Newman said. ‚ÄúBeing relentlessly attacked by the NRA isn‚Äôt something he needs for his personal ambition.‚Äù Backing a ballot initiative on a controversial topic like gun control will likely raise Newsom‚Äôs profile with voters, Schnur said. But it could also backfire and alienate de Leon. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt do his campaign for governor a lot of good to be going up against the most powerful Democrat in the legislature,‚Äù Schnur said. Gun rights supporters say both men are being opportunistic. ‚ÄúLieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom is no stranger to trying to hijack high-profile issues in order to get his name out there,‚Äù said Craig Deluz, a lobbyist for the Calgun Foundation. ‚ÄúAnd Senate Pro Tem de Leon doesn‚Äôt want the Lieutenant Governor to steal his thunder.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 "

Boston men jailed for Trump-inspired hate crime attack,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Two Boston brothers accused of urinating on and beating a homeless Mexican man and telling police ‚ÄúDonald Trump was right: All these illegals need to be deported,‚Äù were sentenced to prison on Monday, prosecutors said. Scott Leader, 38, and Steve Leader, 30, had previously pleaded guilty to indictments charging them with causing bodily injury while committing a civil rights violation, as well as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, among other charges. Scott Leader was sentenced to three years in prison and Steve Leader was sentenced to 1-1/2 years, the Suffolk County District Attorney‚Äôs Office said in a statement. The pair will also be on probation for three years after their prison sentences end. The Leaders were arrested on Aug. 19 on suspicion of beating Rodriguez, then 58, as he slept in a subway station. The men told police they targeted their victim because they believed he was an illegal immigrant.  The victim, Guillermo Rodriguez, said in a statement that he was in fact a permanent resident. ‚ÄúI came to this country many years ago and worked hard in the farm fields to provide produce to people here. I actually became a permanent resident of this country years ago, although if I had been undocumented I still would not have deserved to be beaten this way,‚Äù Rodriguez said in a prepared statement read by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Rimar before the sentencing. The pair punched and kicked Rodriguez, and one of the men repeatedly struck him with a metal pole, before the two walked off laughing, prosecutors said. According to a police report, they told officers, ‚ÄúDonald Trump was right: All these illegals need to be deported.‚Äù Prosecutors said Scott Leader told arresting officers that he believed the attack was justified because the victim was homeless and Hispanic. The pair also allegedly threatened police officers while in custody. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the U.S. presidential race, has been vocal on immigration, proposing to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and promising, if elected, to deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States.

The Times story said Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, asked Lane to change into a bikini shortly after meeting her at a pool party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. According to the article, he then introduced her to the crowd outside, saying, ‚ÄúThat is a stunning Trump girl, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù On Monday, Lane told the same story in a series of television interviews but said she had been flattered by his comment. ‚ÄúThey spun it to where it appeared negative,‚Äù Lane said on Fox News. ‚ÄúI did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump.‚Äù Lane said that during the time she and Trump were dating, he ‚Äúnever made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way.‚Äù She also said she supports Trump‚Äôs presidential run.

House 2017 defense bill would face Obama veto: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs White House set up one last fight with the Republican-controlled Congress over defense spending on Monday, threatening to veto a 2017 defense authorization bill over its use of special war funds for day-to-day military programs. The House of Representatives draft of the $602 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which sets spending policy for the Department of Defense, would shift $18 billion of wartime Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs. The Obama administration objects to the use of that money, saying it threatens U.S. security and unfairly spares the Pentagon from cuts faced by important civilian programs such as medical research and education. ‚ÄúBy gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies,‚Äù the White House said in a statement. House Republicans say the spending plan is essential to ensure that the military has the resources it needs, as it wages wars in Afghanistan and against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The Obama administration also objected to a long list of policy provisions in the bill, including measures making it more difficult to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and cuts in funding for programs to train and equip local fighters in Iraq and Syria. Obama vetoed one version of the 2016 NDAA over its use of OCO funding and the Guantanamo restrictions. He later signed a modified version that addressed his budget concerns but left the Guantanamo measures in place. It will be months before the legislation passes Congress and arrives on Obama‚Äôs desk. The House draft has passed the House Armed Services Committee, and Republican leaders would like a vote by the full House as soon as Wednesday. However, lawmakers have offered 375 amendments on a huge range of issues. The Rules Committee was meeting late on Monday to decide which of those amendments might come up for a vote. The Senate is also drafting its version of the NDAA, which must be reconciled with the House‚Äôs before being subject to vote in both chambers.

They already outlined their respective claims late last year, with the U.S. seeking upwards of $10 billion in compensation for nationalized properties and Cuba demanding at least $121 billion in reparations for the U.S. trade embargo and other acts it described as aggression. ‚ÄúThe United States looks forward to holding these meetings in the near future,‚Äù the embassy said. ‚ÄúTomorrow (we) will discuss specific steps related to bilateral security during the law enforcement dialogue.‚Äù Vidal, who is the Cuban Foreign Ministry‚Äôs chief of U.S. affairs, said the island was hopeful that whomever became next the U.S. president would continue to deepen the detente. The United States will hold a general election on Nov.8. ‚ÄúWhen you look at the polls, the majority of the American population and the Cuban American community are in favor of the normalization of relations,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo I expect their opinion will be taken into account.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 "
Divided lawmakers battle over Puerto Rico debt bill  ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A congressional committee on Monday¬†put off plans to debate legislation¬†on how to address Puerto Rico‚Äôs economic crisis, the latest sign of ongoing struggle by lawmakers to find a solution for the American territory‚Äôs crippling $70 billion debt. For months the Natural Resources Committee of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has been weighing whether and how to rescue Puerto Rico from a crippling debt without spending any U.S. taxpayer money. A committee spokesman said the panel will unveil a new draft proposal soon and then consider that plan in a work session next week. House Speaker Paul Ryan has rejected any bailout of creditors and instead has been mulling the creation of an oversight board that would reschedule the U.S. territory‚Äôs debt payments. The committee repeatedly has had to hold off on such a work session because of a lack of agreement. Some of the panel‚Äôs 26 Republicans oppose any debt restructuring, while some of its 18 Democrats¬†want limitations on the oversight board, and object to some side issues included in the bill, such as one having to do with the Caribbean island‚Äôs minimum wage law. On May 1, Puerto Rico, which is suffering from a 45 percent poverty rate, defaulted on some of its debt when it missed paying the Government Development Bank around $400 million. It faces another debt payment, of nearly $2 billion, on July 1. The Republican-led U.S. Senate has been awaiting action by the House before debating a Puerto Rico debt bill.

Obama administration releases rules on wellness programs,"(Reuters) - A federal agency on Monday released final rules on how employers can offer workers financial incentives of up to 30 percent of the cost of their cheapest health insurance plans to participate in wellness programs without violating federal laws protecting the confidentiality of medical information. The move from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission aims to clear up confusion over the way two federal laws protecting employees‚Äô medical privacy apply to the popular programs, which are designed to control medical spending by reducing obesity, smoking and other risk factors.  The rules, which were first proposed in November, mark a compromise with U.S. businesses that opposed the EEOC‚Äôs previous stance that providing incentives for voluntary wellness programs rendered them involuntary, and thus illegal. The 2010 Affordable Care Act allowed U.S. employers to increase the rewards they offer to employees who participate in wellness programs. But in a series of 2013 lawsuits against companies, including Honeywell International Inc, the EEOC said requests for medical information related to incentive-based wellness programs violated the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.  Under the new rules, incentives for wellness programs are open only to employees, not their families, and are capped at 30 percent of the cheapest individual health insurance premium offered through the employer. The new rules are more restrictive than those passed under the ACA, which allowed incentives of up to 30 percent of the actual cost of an employee‚Äôs insurance plan and 50 percent for programs approved by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services. Only smoking-cessation programs received that approval. Senator Lamar Alexander (R.-Tennessee), chair of the Senate‚Äôs Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said he would push legislation, along with House Republicans, to reverse the rules. The National Business Group on Health, a non-profit organization advocating for large healthcare employers, said that although it would have ‚Äúhoped for some additional flexibility... the rules do what the EEOC was asked to do.‚Äù Some health and workers‚Äô rights groups say the rules, which take effect next year, penalize employees who decline to join wellness programs and hand over private medical information. Maxwell Mehlman, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said lower-income employees could be unduly pressured to join wellness programs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to say that that‚Äôs a voluntary program for a lot of people,‚Äù he said.

U.S. House to weigh $622.1 million in new Zika funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will try to pass legislation this week providing $622.1 million in funds to fight the spreading Zika virus, far less than the Obama administration has been seeking. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers introduced the measure on Monday, according to a statement. The bill would offset the new spending by taking $352.1 million from an Ebola fund and another $270 million from a Department of Health and Human Services administrative account. The bill ‚Äúwill make dollars available to fight the disease now, prioritizing critical activities that must begin immediately, such as vaccine development and mosquito control,‚Äù Rogers said. The mosquito-borne Zika virus has been linked to severe birth defects and other neurological disorders and is beginning to show up in warm climates in U.S. southern states such as Florida. The Obama administration in February called for $1.9 billion in emergency funds that would not result in any government spending cuts elsewhere. The White House and health officials have expressed concerns in the past with taking money from Ebola programs to pay for Zika virus efforts. But in April, after the Republican-led Congress did not act, it found a temporary fix to fund the fight against Zika by redirecting $589 million, mostly from Ebola funds.   White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday that congressional inaction on supplemental funding meant that health officials are forced to resort to the equivalent of ‚Äúdigging through the sofa cushions to try to come up with the necessary money.‚Äù The House bill is also at odds with legislation being debated in the Senate. Competing proposals there would either give Obama the full $1.9 billion or at least $1.1 billion. The Senate is expected to cast initial votes on the alternatives on Tuesday. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of being ‚Äúbeyond reckless‚Äù by being slow to send money to combat a ‚Äúraging virus.‚Äù If the House and Senate approve competing versions they would have to reconcile their differences and pass one uniform bill before sending it to Obama for signing into law. Of the $622.1 million proposed by House Republicans, $230 million would go to the National Institutes of Health to help support the development of vaccines to stop the spread of Zika.  Other funds would be contributed to global health programs, through the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, and for the development of rapid diagnostic tests.

Appeals court revives challenge to California county's gun law,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday revived a lawsuit by prospective gun shop owners who were banned by Alameda County, California, from opening within 500 feet of a residential district, ruling that local officials had failed to justify their law in the face of a constitutional right to bear arms. A three-member panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not strike down the local ordinance, but voted 2-1 to overturn a federal judge who threw the gun store owners‚Äô lawsuit out of court. Gun rights groups quickly hailed the decision as an important protection of the Second Amendment. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very happy to see the Court take a very principled and reasoned approach to protecting the fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms,‚Äù Brandon Combs, executive director of the Calguns Foundation, said in a written statement.  The Ninth Circuit panel ordered that judge to take up the case again and said that if Alameda County wanted to enforce the gun-control ordinance, officials there would have to prove that there was a basis for the restrictions. ‚ÄúAlameda County‚Äôs ordinance may very well be permissible. Thus far, however, the county has failed to justify the burden it has placed on the right of law-abiding citizens to purchase guns,‚Äù Judge Diarmuid O‚ÄôScannlain wrote in a 34-page opinion for the majority.  ‚ÄúThe Second Amendment (of the U.S. Constitution) requires something more rigorous than the unsubstantiated assertions offered to the district court,‚Äù O‚ÄôScannlain wrote. Representatives for the Alameda County Board of Supervisors could not immediately be reached for comment. In tossing the lawsuit out of court, the lower-court judge found that Alameda County‚Äôs gun restrictions were permissible to achieve such ‚Äúimportant governmental objectives‚Äù as protecting public safety, preserving the character of residential areas and guarding against ‚Äúsecondary effects‚Äù of gun stores. But the Ninth Circuit majority said that Alameda County had not provided any evidence that such objectives would be achieved. The plaintiffs also asserted that no parcels in Alameda County would fit within the regulations, which meant that gun sales were effectively banned there. In dissenting from the majority, Judge Barry Silverman said that the ordinance did not infringe upon anyone‚Äôs right to bear arms and that ‚Äúwhat we‚Äôre dealing with here is a mundane zoning dispute dressed up as a Second Amendment challenge.‚Äù     ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 "
Betting on a Trump win or a North Korea H-bomb: a predictions site gains traction,"NEW YORK/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Erik Duhaime is a passive stock market investor, but he isn‚Äôt afraid to short Donald Trump or go long on Hillary Clinton. The 28-year-old from Cambridge, Massachusetts, trades on PredictIt, an online political stock market that allows users to wager small amounts of money on ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù predictions about whether an event will occur. That includes who will win the U.S. presidential election in November. ‚ÄúThis is probably one of the ways I restrain myself from being active in the stock market,‚Äù said Duhaime, a PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, who checks the site a few times a week for fun. PredictIt, which was launched in 2014, now has more than 30,000 traders registered, up from 19,000 at the end of 2015, and has received shout-outs from pundits and presidential campaign advisors alike. Users must be U.S. residents and registered voters. PredictIt says it is not like an online gambling site because it mainly exists to supply its data to universities for academic research, one of the main reasons the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission allows it to operate legally, according to a letter issued by the regulator in 2014. It is jointly run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and a Washington-based political consulting firm Aristotle International Inc.  Unlike mainstream financial markets, bets are not big: The CFTC caps each participant‚Äôs position at $850 per market, and the average deposit when people sign up is just $100. The regulator hasn‚Äôt been as friendly to such betting sites in the past. In 2012, the CFTC filed a civil complaint against the now defunct Intrade for violating a ban on off-exchange options trading. The Ireland-based market also allowed people to wager money on ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù questions, but it wasn‚Äôt tied to an academic institution and didn‚Äôt have a cap on the maximum amount that could be traded.  Predictions markets like PredictIt and a similar venue run by the University of Iowa have emerged as an alternative to polling for election forecasters. PredictIt is bigger than the Iowa Electronic Markets, which has only about 2,000 active traders with access to its political markets. ‚ÄúPolling is very expensive,‚Äù said David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research who runs a predictions-market aggregator called PredictWise, which draws heavily from PredictIt. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a slow process. It‚Äôs not very flexible.‚Äù Knowledge of polls does also feed into betting decisions on PredictIt. ‚ÄúPredictions markets translate this and other information into probability,‚Äù said Rajiv Sethi, professor of economics at Barnard College. ‚ÄúThe basic intuition is that it‚Äôs a ‚Äòwisdom of crowds‚Äô effect.‚Äù     For example, Trump‚Äôs chances of securing the Republican nomination for the presidential election swung dramatically on the site over the past three months as the primary season progressed. A Trump share shot from 30 cents in early February when he lost to rival Ted Cruz in the Iowa primary to 80 cents a month later when Trump dominated on Super Tuesday. They then lost half their value by early April as Cruz appeared to regain momentum with a big win in Wisconsin. With Cruz and another rival, John Kasich, now out of the race, Trump had risen to 94 cents by Monday. For graphic showing Trump's ascendancy on PredictIt during primary season, see tmsnrt.rs/1WmRq For November‚Äôs election, though, Trump is trailing on PredictIt with 40 cents against Clinton‚Äôs 59 cents.  While PredictIt‚Äôs precision has yet to be closely examined by academics, other predictions markets such as the Iowa Electronic Markets, have proven to be just as accurate as polls, experts who have studied them said. PredictIt markets go beyond topics related to U.S. elections. Users also put the probability of a North Korea hydrogen bomb test this year at only 29 cents, and a British exit from the European Union by 2017 at just 30 cents. The idea for PredictIt was first thought up in the mid-1990s by Lew Evans, professor of economics at the University of Victoria. It took until 2008, for the market, called ‚ÄúiPredict‚Äù in New Zealand, to get up and running.  Early on, it focused primarily on New Zealand politics, and research showed iPredict out-performed the majority of polls in predicting the results in two of New Zealand‚Äôs last three general elections. However, new anti-money laundering laws in New Zealand put an end to iPredict last year after the cost of verifying users‚Äô identities to comply with the rules threatened to blow through iPredict‚Äôs shoe-string budget.¬†  PredictIt attracts everyone from campaign volunteers to political junkies. In mid-April, about 30 PredictIt traders gathered at a bar in New York to watch the state‚Äôs primary results roll in. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a good source of collective wisdom,‚Äù said Brian Hegarty, who was at the event. Hegarty, who worked for Kasich‚Äôs campaign, reads political news, but also relied on picking up information through his campaign experience. That didn‚Äôt always translate to a bet in favor of Kasich. He said he put money on Republican candidate Marco Rubio to win the Minnesota caucus because he had overheard someone who was working for the Florida senator express confidence about Rubio‚Äôs chances. It turned out to be one of the few states Rubio won before dropping out in mid-March. Duhaime, the MIT student,¬†said he usually bets against candidates he believes are likely to flame out.  ‚ÄúFor me, Trump was one of those people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI shorted Trump way back in July, and it hasn‚Äôt been fun watching.‚Äù  After Trump‚Äôs win in Indiana in early May, Duhaime was down nearly $1,000, about a third of the money he put into PredictIt.  ‚ÄúI still think it was a one in a hundred thing,‚Äù Duhaime, who doesn‚Äôt identify as a Democrat but is a fan of President Barack Obama, said of the Trump phenomenon. ‚ÄúObviously I‚Äôm bummed, but I‚Äôm sort of more concerned for other reasons.‚Äù (This version of the story corrects the spelling of Lew Evans) ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 "

Obama says transgender rule is important aid to schools: BuzzFeed,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Monday that his administration‚Äôs guidance on transgender issues is needed to help schools grapple with the sensitive topic and ensure that all children are treated fairly. Obama, in an interview with BuzzFeed news website broadcast live on Facebook and YouTube, said schools had been asking the Department of Education how they should handle questions they were facing with transgender youths. ‚ÄúWe think it was important for schools who want to go ahead and, in a very practical way, try to deal with the school year - What are they going to be doing next year? How should we approach this? - that we give them our best judgment about how to approach it,‚Äù Obama said. The Obama administration told U.S. public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority. The Education and Justice Departments told school districts nationwide that while the guidance carries no legal weight, they must not discriminate against students, including based on their gender identity. Obama, who has two teenaged daughters, elaborated on the decision. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about kids. And anybody who‚Äôs been in school, been in high school, who‚Äôs been a parent, I think, should realize that kids who are sometimes in the minority, kids who have a different sexual orientation or are transgender are subject to a lot of bullying, potentially,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThey are vulnerable. And I think that it‚Äôs part of our obligation as a society to make sure that everybody is treated fairly and our kids are all loved and that they‚Äôre protected and that their dignity is affirmed,‚Äù he said.

The police report said Pierce followed the couple through the hotel and tried to force his way into their room, and also that he pulled the woman‚Äôs hoodie off and hit her in the head.

Philadelphia congressman orchestrated series of frauds: prosecutor,"(Reuters) - Representative Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania and several associates orchestrated a series of fraudulent schemes to enrich the congressman and preserve his political career, federal prosecutors said at the start of his corruption trial on Monday. ‚ÄúThe congressman stole from federal agencies, from taxpayers, from nonprofit educational groups he created,‚Äù Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Gray told a Philadelphia jury. ‚ÄúHe even stole from his own political campaigns.‚Äù But defense lawyers said the government‚Äôs case relied almost entirely on the word of two convicted felons who received favorable plea deals. ‚ÄúCongressman Fattah had nothing to do with any of it,‚Äù said Mark Lee, a lawyer for Fattah. The 59-year-old Fattah, an 11-term congressman who represents parts of Philadelphia, lost the Democratic primary in April under the cloud of a wide-ranging indictment charging him with racketeering, bribery and fraud. Some of the alleged schemes stemmed from Fattah‚Äôs unsuccessful 2007 mayoral campaign, when prosecutors say he accepted a secret and illegal $1 million loan from Al Lord, former chief executive officer of student loan servicer SLM Corp, known as Sallie Mae. Following the race, Fattah convinced Karen Nicholas, who ran his nonprofit educational organization, to transfer charitable and federal grant money to pay Lord back, Gray said. Separately, Fattah owed consultant Thomas Lindenfeld more than $100,000. With no funds to repay him, Fattah encouraged Lindenfeld to apply for federal money for a nonprofit that didn‚Äôt exist, prosecutors said. In a third scheme, Fattah funneled campaign money through another consultant, Gregory Naylor, to pay off his son‚Äôs student debt, prosecutors said. The son, Chaka Fattah Jr., was convicted in an unrelated fraud case and sentenced earlier this year to five years in prison. Both Lindenfeld and Naylor have pleaded guilty in exchange for testifying against Fattah. Prosecutors also said Fattah accepted bribes from a close friend, retired businessman Herb Vederman, who was seeking a U.S. ambassadorship. Fattah personally appealed to President Barack Obama to appoint Vederman to an international post. ‚ÄúCongressman Fattah used Herb Vederman as a human ATM machine whenever he needed a little money,‚Äù Gray said. But lawyers for Fattah and Vederman said prosecutors had ‚Äúcherry-picked‚Äù evidence to suggest a bribery scheme when the two men simply acted out of friendship. Nicholas, Vederman and two other Fattah associates, consultant Robert Brand and campaign treasurer Bonnie Bowser, are co-defendants in the trial, which is expected to last eight weeks.

Trump says unlikely to have good relationship with UK's Cameron,"LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with David Cameron because the British prime minister cast the U.S. presidential candidate as ‚Äúdivisive, stupid and wrong‚Äù for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Cameron criticised Trump in the British parliament over his call for the ban on Muslims and suggested that the New York billionaire, who is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, would unite Britain against him if he visited. ‚ÄúIt looks like we‚Äôre not going to have a very good relationship, who knows?‚Äù Trump told Britain‚Äôs ITV television station in an interview aired on Monday when asked how ties would fare if he won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. ‚ÄúWell number one, I‚Äôm not stupid, okay. I can tell you that right now. Just the opposite. Number Two, in terms of divisive: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a divisive person. I‚Äôm a unifier, unlike our president right now,‚Äù Trump said, referring to Barack Obama. Cameron‚Äôs spokesman said the prime minister stood by his original comments. The United States is Britain‚Äôs closest ally. U.S. companies are the biggest foreign direct investors in Britain and the so- called ‚Äòspecial relationship‚Äô with Washington has been the cornerstone of British diplomacy since World War Two. Trump‚Äôs often controversial comments on everything from Muslims and women to the future of NATO and relations with Russia have drawn criticism from Berlin, Paris and other European capitals. But neither Germany‚Äôs Angela Merkel nor France‚Äôs Francois Hollande have gone as far as Cameron in chiding Trump who, if he wins in November, would be in charge of the world‚Äôs most powerful nation and largest economy from January 20 next year. Cameron will work with whoever is elected U.S. president and is committed to maintaining the special relationship, the prime minister‚Äôs spokesman said. ‚ÄúThe PM has made his views on Donald Trump‚Äôs comments very clear. He disagrees with them,‚Äù the spokesman said. ‚ÄúHe continues to believe that preventing Muslims from entering the U.S. is divisive, stupid and wrong. He stands by his comments.‚Äù The spokesman refused to answer questions on who Cameron would like to see win in November but said there was no telephone call or meeting planned with Trump, adding: ‚ÄúIf one is proposed we will consider it.‚Äù On a more conciliatory note, Cameron has said Trump deserves respect for making it through the gruelling Republican primary process. The Times newspaper also reported last month Cameron had ordered diplomats to attempt to repair relations with Trump. ‚ÄúI hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like he‚Äôs not willing to address the problem either,‚Äù Trump told ITV. Trump also criticised London‚Äôs newly elected Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan for making ‚Äúvery rude statements‚Äù. Trump had initially welcomed Khan‚Äôs election and said he would make an exception in the event of a ban on Muslims for him entering the United States, drawing a sharp reply from Khan. ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe - it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of the extremists,‚Äù Khan said. Responding to this criticism in the ITV interview, Trump said: ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt know me, never met me, doesn‚Äôt know what I am all about. I think they are very rude statements. Frankly, tell him I will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements. It is ignorant for him to say that.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 "
Democrats use Trump as bogeyman to get people to vote,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic Party activists in some U.S. states are using Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate who has stirred controversy with his comments about illegal immigrants and women, as the centerpiece of their ‚Äúget out the vote‚Äù campaign for the November elections. In California, canvassers from the Orange County Democrats carry pictures of Trump when they knock on doors ahead of the June 7 California primary. They ask if people will vote in the primary, and warn that if they don‚Äôt help pick the strongest possible Democrat, ‚Äúthis guy will win,‚Äù said Henry Vandermeir, the local party chairman in Orange County, a traditionally Republican island in the state.  Democrats in New Hampshire have unveiled Trump/Sununu lawn signs, looking to tie Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Sununu to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on issues such as climate change (Trump is a skeptic) and healthcare. One sign reads: ‚ÄúTrump/Sununu. Because Health Care Is For Losers,‚Äù a swipe at Trump‚Äôs vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama‚Äôs signature healthcare law. ‚ÄúEvery state party is trying to maximize what they can get out of this difference (between candidates) and to tie Trump to the Republicans in the state,‚Äù said Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party.  The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. To be sure, Republicans appear likely to use Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination who is also a polarizing figure, in a similar fashion.  ‚ÄúThere is no better volunteer recruitment tool, fundraising pitch, or unifier for the Republican Party than the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency that will surely take us further backwards,‚Äù the Republican National Committee said in a statement. Democrats are also looking to tie Trump to Republican Senate candidates on the Nov. 8 ballot as they seek to regain control of the chamber they lost in the 2014 congressional elections. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last week released so-called ‚ÄúTrump cards‚Äù online, equating several Republican senators‚Äô policy positions with those of the New York developer.     For Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey and New Hampshire‚Äôs Kelly Ayotte, for example, the DSCC highlighted how they and Trump oppose a federal minimum wage hike.  The DSCC also launched a website in March, partyoftrump.com, which labeled some senators ‚ÄúRetrumplicans‚Äù and asked for donations to help fight senators who support Trump. Recent polls suggest that a Trump/Clinton matchup could be a tight race. The two candidates were in a dead heat in the three key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania in a Quinnipiac University poll earlier in May. And a Reuters poll this month showed that much of the backing for Clinton and Trump comes from people whose primary motivation is to stop the other side from winning, rather than any love for either of the two candidates or their policies.     The strategy of highlighting opposing candidates is not without risks, according to Bruce Newman, the author of ‚ÄúThe Marketing Revolution in Politics: What Recent U.S. Presidential Campaigns Can Teach Us About Effective Marketing.‚Äù If Trump - who shocked pundits by beating 16 other Republican hopefuls for the nomination - proves more attractive to the general electorate than Hillary Clinton, then tying him to other Republicans could hurt Democrats ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know how popular this guy is going to get,‚Äù Newman said. ‚ÄúThis is just the beginning.‚Äù (This version of the story has been refiled to add dropped ‚Äúto‚Äù in final paragraph) ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 "

Trump aide dismisses audio tape as Democrats raise character issue,"WASHINGTON, 2016 - A top aide to Donald Trump said on Sunday he did not believe the Republican presidential front-runner posed as his own spokesman to brag about his personal life, a controversy that came as Democrats sharpen their attacks on the billionaire‚Äôs character.  The Washington Post released an audio recording on Friday of a man who identified himself as Trump publicist ‚ÄúJohn Miller‚Äù and talked about the real estate tycoon‚Äôs romantic encounters in a 1991 conversation with a People magazine reporter. After listening to the tape while appearing on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù show, senior Trump adviser Paul Manafort said he did not believe it was the Republican candidate‚Äôs voice despite his past admissions of sometimes using a pseudonym.  ‚ÄúI could barely understand it,‚Äù Manafort said. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt tell who it is. Donald Trump says it‚Äôs not him, I believe it‚Äôs not him.‚Äù Trump told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show on Friday that the voice was not his, although he has admitted in years past to using at least one pseudonym to speak to reporters.  The original People article, which ran in 1991, winkingly described Miller as ‚Äúa mysterious PR man who sounds just like Donald.‚Äù Within a few days of that article, Sue Carswell, the People reporter who originally made the recording, reported that Trump had admitted that he posed as Miller as a joke and had apologized for it. Trump earlier this month effectively locked up the Republican nomination to run in the Nov. 8 presidential election and has been working to try to unify his party after many of its leaders opposed his candidacy. Leading Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs allies have described Trump as ‚Äúdeceptive‚Äù and honed in on his treatment of women. Clinton has begun attacking Trump more aggressively since he effectively secured the nomination, deriding his character and recently suggesting he is hiding something by not releasing his tax returns. Trump has reacted angrily to criticism he sometimes reduces women to their appearances, and in turn has criticized Clinton for how she and her husband, Bill Clinton, treated women who accused the former president of sexual indiscretions. Bill Clinton has admitted to having extra-marital affairs with two women: Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and Gennifer Flowers, a singer and actor from Arkansas.   On Sunday, Trump used his Twitter account to deride a New York Times article in which several women said he had ‚Äúunnerved‚Äù them over the years with comments about their looks and unwelcome advances. The article also said he had a good track record of promoting women to senior positions, which was rare in the real estate industry. ‚ÄúEveryone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women,‚Äù went one message posted on Trump‚Äôs account on Sunday. Democratic President Barack Obama used a commencement speech at a university on Sunday to criticize Trump‚Äôs positions, including a proposal to temporarily ban non-American Muslims from entering the United States. ‚ÄúIsolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country, that is not just a betrayal of our values, that is not who Americans are,‚Äù he told the students at Rutgers University in New Jersey.  Although it was widely reported in the early 1990s that Trump sometimes posed as a fake spokesman in order to shape media coverage, the recording of what is said to be such an occurrence only emerged a few days ago. It quickly rippled through American media. The comedy television program ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù showed a skit with an actor posing as Trump calling reporters pretending to be his own spokesman, named John Pepperoni. Trump‚Äôs willingness to pose as a fake spokesman first emerged in 1990, when he testified during a lawsuit that he had used the pseudonym John Baron, sometimes rendered in news reports as John Barron, when speaking to journalists by telephone. ‚ÄúLots of people use pen names,‚Äù Newsday quoted Trump as saying after his testimony. ‚ÄúErnest Hemingway used one.‚Äù  ",politicsNews,"May 15, 2016 "
"Trump, Biden attend same Pennsylvania college graduation","(Reuters) - Presidential politics crept into the graduation ceremony at the University of Pennsylvania on Sunday, with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Joe Biden in attendance to cheer on family members. The two men sat relatively near each other at the event in Philadelphia, where the Trump family gathered to watch the real estate tycoon‚Äôs daughter, Tiffany, graduate from the Ivy League school. Biden came to support granddaughter Naomi. Tiffany Trump, 22, is the daughter of Trump and his ex-wife Marla Maples. Naomi Biden is named after the vice president‚Äôs one-year-old daughter, who died in a 1972 car accident along with the girl‚Äôs mother, Biden‚Äôs first wife. Donald Trump, who earlier this month effectively secured the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, also attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating from its Wharton business school. Biden, who is not running in the 2016 election, has been a bitter critic of Trump‚Äôs policies and campaign tactics, calling the Republican front-runner‚Äôs remark that Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals across the border a ‚Äúsick message.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 15, 2016 "
Trump says Brexit wouldn't impact potential UK-U.S. trade deal if he is president: ITV,"LONDON (Reuters) - Presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Britain leaving the European Union would make no difference to a potential bilateral trade deal if he became president, according to an interview clip aired by broadcaster ITV on Sunday. During a visit to London last month President Barack Obama told Britons that if they elected to leave the EU in a June 23 referendum they would be at ‚Äúthe back of the queue‚Äù for a U.S. trade deal. ‚ÄúI am going to treat everybody fairly but it wouldn‚Äôt make any difference to me whether they were in the EU or not,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with Piers Morgan, due to be aired in full on ITV on Monday. ‚ÄúYou would certainly not be back of the queue, that I can tell you.‚Äù ",politicsNews,"May 15, 2016 "
Facebook's Zuckerberg to meet conservatives on political bias flap,"(Reuters) - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will meet this week with prominent conservatives in the media, a spokesman said on Sunday, to address allegations of political bias at the popular social networking site. Some 12 ‚Äúconservative thought leaders‚Äù will join the meeting with Zuckerberg on Wednesday, a Facebook spokesman said. Among the invitees are media personality Glenn Beck, Fox News Channel‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Five‚Äù co-host Dana Perino and Zac Moffatt, co-founder of Targeted Victory, a technology company that aims to bring transparency to media buying. Facebook came under fire last week when an unnamed former employee told technology news website Gizmodo that workers often omitted conservative political stories from the company‚Äôs ‚Äútrending‚Äù list of topics. Zuckerberg said Facebook has ‚Äúfound no evidence that this report is true,‚Äù but would continue to investigate. A U.S. Senate committee has also opened an inquiry into Facebook‚Äôs practices. Beck, a former Fox News host, took to Facebook early Sunday to say he is going to the meeting in Menlo Park, California, and  ‚Äúit would be interesting to look him (Zuckerberg) in the eye as he explains.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile they are a private business and I support their right to run it any way they desire without government interference,‚Äù Beck said, ‚Äúit would be wonderful if a tool like face book [sic] INDEPENDENTLY CHOSE to hold up Freedom of speech and freedom of association as a corporate principle.‚Äù On Friday, Facebook outlined its ‚ÄúTrending Topics‚Äù guidelines in its media relations section and stated that reviewers are neither allowed nor advised to discriminate against sources.  Facebook, now valued at around $350 billion, has become a bigger source of news for its more than 1 billion daily active users. Sixty-three percent of users, or 41 percent of all U.S. adults, say they get news from the site, according to a study last year by the Pew Research Center and the Knight Foundation.

Trump has a history of questionable behavior with women: NY Times,"(Reuters) - Interviews with dozens of women who have worked for Donald Trump or interacted with him socially reveal a pattern of often unsettling personal behavior by the Republican presidential candidate, The New York Times reported on Saturday.  The Times, which said it based the article on more than 50 interviews, quoted women who recounted episodes in which he treated women as sexual objects and made comments about their bodies. But some women said Trump had encouraged them in their careers and promoted them within his businesses, often in positions in which women tended to be excluded. When asked about the unflattering incidents described in the article, Trump either denied that they took place or disputed the details, the newspaper said. ‚ÄúA lot of things get made up over the years,‚Äù Trump told the Times. ‚ÄúI have always treated women with great respect.‚Äù A Trump representative did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Barbara Res, who oversaw construction of Trump‚Äôs Manhattan business headquarters, said he would sometimes interrupt meetings with comments about women‚Äôs figures.  During a job interview for a Los Angeles project, for example, Trump made a random aside about Southern California women. ‚ÄúThey take care of their asses,‚Äù Res recalled Trump saying. Years later, when Res says she had gained weight, she said Trump told her: ‚ÄúYou like your candy.‚Äù Even so, Res, who worked for Trump for 12 years before quitting and then came back as a consultant for six more, said she was grateful to Trump for her professional opportunities, though she said he frequently called her ‚ÄúHoney Bunch,‚Äù the Times reported.   Trump also earned a reputation for being seen with beautiful women dating back to his days at a New York military-style boarding school where he was named ‚Äúladies‚Äô man‚Äù in the yearbook, the Times reported.   Barbara Fife, a deputy New York mayor in the 1990s, recalls Trump telling her at her City Hall office that he was in a hurry because he had ‚Äúa great date tonight with a model for Victoria‚Äôs Secret,‚Äù she told the Times. ‚ÄúI saw it as immature, quite honestly,‚Äù Fife was quoted as saying. As a candidate, Trump has made frequent references to his record in business as evidence of how American women would benefit if he is elected. He has often said that no one ‚Äúcherishes‚Äù or ‚Äúrespects‚Äù women more than him.¬†¬†  ¬†¬†¬†¬†Some of those interviewed praised Trump for giving women positions of power. ‚ÄúI think there are mischaracterizations about him,‚Äù Jill Martin, assistant counsel at the Trump Organization, told the Times. ‚ÄúFor me, he‚Äôs made it a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time necessary for my family.‚Äù The story comes less than two weeks after the last of Trump‚Äôs Republican rivals dropped out, all but assuring him the party‚Äôs presidential nomination this summer.  Throughout his improbable campaign, Trump has managed to deflect criticism about his attitude to women, fueled by verbal insults he lobbed at Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina.

Obama toasts Nordic nations after Russia-focused summit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama toasted Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland at a star-studded state dinner on Friday, lauding the nations for their global influence on civil rights, humanitarian issues and curbing climate change. The red carpet glamor followed a White House summit where Obama and the leaders of the five nations presented a united front against Moscow‚Äôs recent military aggression in Ukraine and the Baltic region. But the meeting was more about soft diplomacy than launching ambitious foreign policy endeavors, given that Obama‚Äôs second and final term ends in January. Americans will vote in presidential elections on Nov. 8. ‚ÄúI thought this was a very useful and important conversation, although there was probably too much agreement to make for as exciting a multilateral meeting as I sometimes participate in,‚Äù Obama said. More than 300 guests including rapper Common, comedian Will Farrell and actress Tracee Ellis Ross mingled with diplomats, tech and Fortune 500 CEOs, White House officials, and political donors in a glass-ceiling tent built around a tree on the South Lawn. Hand-rolled beeswax candles and strings of lights reflected off ten-foot pillars of ice, an homage to the northern lights. Pop star Demi Lovato, known for her support of liberal causes, was set to perform after a Nordic-inspired meal of ahi tuna, tomato tartare and red wine-braised beef short ribs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great opportunity to drink wine and make progress on the most serious issues of our time,‚Äù Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters on her way into the dinner. The summit was aimed in part at sending a message to a nation not on the guest list: Russia, which annexed Ukraine‚Äôs Crimea region in 2014 and has stepped up its military posture. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is planning its biggest build-up in eastern Europe since the Cold War to try to deter further Russian aggression, and Denmark and Norway said on Friday they would contribute to the ‚Äúenhanced allied forward presence‚Äù with NATO. ‚ÄúWe will be maintaining ongoing dialogue and seek cooperation with Russia, but we also want to make sure that we are prepared and strong, and we want to encourage Russia to keep its military activities in full compliance with international obligations,‚Äù Obama said after the summit. Obama has long expressed admiration for the pragmatic and liberal-leaning politics of the Nordic nations. ‚ÄúThere have been times where I‚Äôve said, why don‚Äôt we just put all these small countries in charge for a while? And they could clean things up,‚Äù Obama said. (This version of the story corrects the title of Samantha Power in the eighth paragraph) ",politicsNews,"May 13, 2016 "

U.S. tells schools to give transgender students bathroom rights,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration told U.S. public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority.  Conservatives pushed back against the administration‚Äôs non-binding guidance to schools, the latest battleground in the issue of rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the guidance ‚Äúmust be challenged.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf President Obama thinks he can bully Texas schools into allowing men to have open access to girls in bathrooms, he better prepare for yet another legal fight,‚Äù  Paxton, a Tea Party champion, said in a statement. Other Republican-led states joined calls to disregard the White House‚Äôs directive and accused the administration of overstepping its role. In North Carolina, Governor Pat McCrory labeled the move a ‚Äúmassive executive branch overreach‚Äù and called on federal courts and the U.S. Congress to intercede, while Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said it was ‚Äúoffensive, intrusive and totally lacking in common sense.‚Äù The U.S. Education and Justice Departments, in a letter, told school districts nationwide that while the guidance carries no legal weight, they must not discriminate against students, including based on their gender identity. The guidance contained an implicit threat that school districts defying the Obama administration‚Äôs interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or be deprived of federal aid. The White House defended its actions, saying the guidance should not be viewed as a threat but instead as a set of ‚Äúspecific, tangible, real-world advice and suggestions‚Äù that many schools had sought and will welcome. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôre looking for: solutions that protect the safety and dignity of every single student in school,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing, adding that the idea was to prevent discrimination against a range of groups extending beyond the transgender community.    The directive came as the Justice Department and North Carolina are battling in federal court over a North Carolina state law approved in March that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their gender assigned at birth, while other states weigh similar measures. North Carolina‚Äôs law was the first to ban people from restrooms in public buildings and schools not matching the sex on their birth certificate. Mississippi has enacted legislation similarly viewed as discriminatory by civil and gay rights groups, and Tennessee and Missouri considered similar measures. The letter to the schools from Washington said that, to get federal funding under existing rules, a school has to agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. That includes not treating a transgender student differently from other students of the same gender identity, officials said. The American Civil Liberties Union said the guidance would help make students ‚Äúfree to bring their whole selves to school.‚Äù In a sign of what defiant states may face, the Justice Department this week asked a U.S. District Court in North Carolina to declare the state in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. Americans are divided over which public restrooms should be used by transgender people, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify. A group representing U.S. school boards called the guidance ‚Äúunsettled law.‚Äù ‚ÄúA dispute about the intent of the federal law must ultimately be resolved by the courts and the Congress,‚Äù the National School Boards Association said in a statement.  Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was less critical than many of his party in several television interviews, saying the issue should be left up to individual states.  ‚ÄúEverybody has to be protected ... but it‚Äôs a tiny, tiny portion of the population,‚Äù Trump told Fox News.

"Trump taps climate change skeptic as energy adviser, pushes back on taxes","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Friday picked a prominent climate change skeptic to help him craft his energy policy and pushed back against renewed calls that he release his income tax returns - saying his tax rate is ‚Äúnone of your business.‚Äù The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is seeking to build out his policy proposals as he pivots from campaigning for his party‚Äôs nomination to a likely general election matchup with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Among those he has asked for help is U.S. Republican Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the country‚Äôs most ardent oil and gas drilling advocates and climate change skeptics. North Dakota has been at the forefront of the U.S. shale oil and gas boom.  Trump‚Äôs team asked Cramer, who has endorsed Trump, to write a white paper, or detailed report, on his energy policy ideas, according to Cramer and sources familiar with the matter. Cramer said in an interview that his white paper would emphasize the dangers of foreign ownership of U.S. energy assets, as well as what he characterized as burdensome taxes and over-regulation. Trump will have an opportunity to float some of the ideas at an energy summit in Bismarck, North Dakota on May 26, Cramer said.     The senator was also among a group of Trump advisers who recently met with lawmakers from Western energy states, who hope Trump will open more federal land for drilling, a lawmaker who took part in the meeting said. A spokeswoman for Trump‚Äôs campaign did not comment. Environmental groups, and Clinton‚Äôs campaign, quickly attacked Trump for tapping Cramer. ‚ÄúKevin Cramer has consistently backed reckless and dangerous schemes to put the profits of fossil fuel executives before the health of the public, so he and Trump are a match made in polluter heaven,‚Äù Sierra Club Legislative Director Melinda Pierce said in an emailed statement. The Clinton campaign also criticized the move.     ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs choice of outspoken climate (change) denier Kevin Cramer to advise him on energy policy is just the latest piece of evidence that letting him get near the White House would put our children‚Äôs health and futures at risk,‚Äù said campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson. Trump has been light on the details of his energy policy, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were president. He has also claimed global warming is a concept ‚Äúcreated by and for the Chinese‚Äù to hurt U.S. business. Clinton, meanwhile, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies ‚Äúout of business.‚Äù Trump also took heat on Friday for not releasing his tax returns, something that American presidential candidates have done for decades. Clinton and her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have both released their returns. Trump has said the Internal Revenue Service was auditing his returns and he wanted to wait until the review was over before making them public. ‚ÄúIt should be, and I hope it‚Äôs before the election,‚Äù Trump told ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America.‚Äù Pressed on what tax rate he pays, Trump refused to say. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs none of your business,‚Äù he said. The candidate has said there is nothing voters can learn from his tax filings.  Tax filings show sources of income, both from within the United States and other countries, as well as charitable giving, investments, deductions and other financial information. The IRS declined to comment on whether Trump or any other presidential candidates were being audited. However, the Trump campaign earlier this year released a letter from his attorneys saying his personal tax returns have been under ‚Äúcontinuous examination‚Äù from the IRS. This week, Clinton began calling on her probable Republican rival to release his returns. Last August, the former U.S. secretary of state posted the past eight years of tax returns for her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, on her website. Sanders released his 2014 return in April.  Presidential candidates have a long history in the modern era of releasing their tax returns. ‚ÄúIn 1976, Gerald Ford did not release his returns, but he did release some information about his taxes,‚Äù said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that provides tax news and analysis. ‚ÄúThat was the last time that a major party nominee hasn‚Äôt done it,‚Äù he said.

First $200 admission for a Trump rally; more to come?,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The email Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign sent inviting fans to a rally next week looked familiar: ‚ÄúMeet me in New Jersey!‚Äù it urged. But something was different. ‚ÄúYou will need to buy a ticket to get into the rally,‚Äù it added. The cost: $200. During the months-long battle for the Republican presidential nomination, rallies staged by Trump, the party‚Äôs likely candidate in the Nov. 8 election, were free and open to anyone with the stamina to withstand half a day‚Äôs wait outside and a heady hour packed into a sports stadium or warehouse. Supporters could buy snacks or hats or T-shirts while they waited, but they never had to pay for admission. The May 19 rally advertised in the email is a fundraiser for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival now working for Trump who, according to news reports, needs to retire debt from his own failed campaign. The emailed invitation to supporters said it will be a fundraiser. It was not clear whether Trump will charge for rallies that are not specifically designated as fundraisers.  The New York billionaire has claimed he was self-funding his campaign and did not need donations. He has financed his offensive in the nominating phase of the race for the White House with loans to himself as well as around $12 million in unsolicited donations from fans. Now that Trump is pivoting toward the general election, where conventional estimates put the cost of winning at around $1 billion, things are changing.  The move to charge admission for some appearances was just one harbinger of a new relationship between Trump and his fans, many of whom cited their perception of his financial independence as a major factor behind their support. It will test the loyalty of those who have swelled his rallies to capacity, either transforming huge crowds into cash cows or creating more breathing room in the places where he appears.      When asked whether the format of the Christie fundraiser rally would be repeated in the future, Trump‚Äôs spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not comment. ‚ÄúThis is a fundraiser for Governor Christie,‚Äù she said. Supporters have said Trump‚Äôs about-face on fundraising does not bother them. Susan Kihne, a Mandan, North Dakota resident who snagged a ticket to see Trump speak at a petroleum conference later this month decided the $30 it cost her was worth it. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs self-funded up until now, so I don‚Äôt mind supporting him,‚Äù she said.

U.S. guidance on school restroom choice opposed by some states,"(Reuters) - Transgender students cheered the Obama administration‚Äôs directive on Friday requiring U.S. public schools to allow them to use toilets and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity while some school districts said they would not comply. ‚ÄúThis is the strongest guidance to date from the federal government to schools instructing them on how they must treat transgender students fairly and without discrimination,‚Äù said Ilona Turner, legal director at the Transgender Law Center in California.  ‚ÄúThis will be something that courts will have to give great weight to.‚Äù The letter, signed by officials from the U.S. Education and Justice Departments, intensified the debate over balancing equal rights with privacy concerns.  The Obama administration told U.S. public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority. Transgender student Gavin Grimm, who won a U.S. appeals court ruling in April in his fight over bathroom access at his Virginia high school, said he was happy with the support from the Obama administration. ‚ÄúThis guidance would have made a big difference in my life,‚Äù he wrote on Twitter.   Educators are facing scrutiny and legal action over access to toilets and locker rooms based on gender identity versus a student‚Äôs sex at birth. The federal government‚Äôs position is that U.S. laws against sex discrimination in educational programs include gender identity. Friday‚Äôs directive was the broadest attempt to enforce that stance on a national basis.  But North Carolina‚Äôs Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest said in a statement that the state would ‚Äúnot stand by and let our locker rooms and high school showers be used for social experimentation at the expense of the privacy and protection of our young boys and girls.‚Äù  Forest advised schools to reject the policy and said a state law enacted in March restricting bathroom choice for transgender people trumped the administration‚Äôs ‚Äúnon-binding directive.‚Äù North Carolina is locked in a high-profile legal battle with the federal government over its ‚Äúbathroom bill.‚Äù On Monday, Republican leaders of the state‚Äôs legislature said they had sued the U.S. Justice Department over the state‚Äôs law restricting public bathroom access for transgender people. That lawsuit came hours after North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory sued the Justice Department, accusing it of overreaching after federal lawyers said the state‚Äôs law requiring public bathroom use based on birth gender was a civil rights violation.    In Florida, Marion County Public Schools showed no sign of backing down from a resolution passed in April requiring students to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe our board will reverse the decision unless it is instructed by the courts,‚Äù the school system‚Äôs spokesman Kevin Christian said in a telephone interview. Mississippi‚Äôs Department of Education said it would comply with the federal guidance. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order in March allowing a person of any gender to choose whether to use a men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs toilet or locker room in all municipal properties including public parks, pools, and playgrounds. The order requires city agencies to post the policy in conspicuous locations within three months and to train all employees within two years. New York City‚Äôs action came a week after South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard vetoed a bill that would have made the state the first to limit transgender students to bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their birth gender. In November, Houston voters overwhelmingly rejected a measure known as the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance‚Äù that would have established non-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. Nationwide, 22 percent of transgender and gender non-conforming people report being denied access to appropriate bathrooms at work, and 26 percent report being denied access to bathrooms in an educational setting, according to a survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

Exclusive: U.S. to renew most Myanmar sanctions with changes to aid business,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States plans to renew the bulk of its sanctions against Myanmar when they expire next week, but will make some  changes aimed at boosting investment and trade, according to several senior U.S. officials and congressional aides. An announcement on extending much of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, could come as soon as Tuesday ahead of a visit to the Southeast Asian nation by Secretary of State John Kerry on May 22, officials said. The U.S. Treasury Department has significantly eased sanctions against Myanmar by issuing general licenses that give companies and investors exemptions to sanctions targeting more than 100 individuals and businesses, including some of Myanmar‚Äôs biggest business players. U.S. officials began lifting trade and financial sanctions against the country after military leaders launched reforms that led to a civilian government being formed in 2011, beginning its transformation from a half-century as an international pariah. In December, Treasury temporarily relaxed trade restrictions on the country also known as Burma by allowing all shipments to go through its ports and airports for six months. This time, Washington will likely offer more general licenses to specific companies, and take some people off Treasury‚Äôs list of ‚ÄúSpecially Designated Individuals‚Äù targeted for sanctions, congressional aides and U.S. officials said. Kerry‚Äôs visit to Myanmar is his first since the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, the country‚Äôs Nobel laureate, swept to power following a landslide election win in November. A constitution drafted by the country‚Äôs former military rulers bars her from becoming president. President Barack Obama‚Äôs opening to Myanmar followed by its peaceful transition to an elected government is seen as one of his foreign policy achievements. He has visited there twice. But the administration also wants to maintain leverage on the country to guard against backsliding on reforms and to press for improvement on human rights. By renewing the legal framework for sanctions even as it eases some measures, Obama will offer the private sector more breathing room while maintaining pressure on its military, which still holds significant political power. The sanctions had been due to expire on May 20. Washington has deep concerns about human rights conditions in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, especially violence against ethnic and religious minorities including Rohingya Muslims. Members of the U.S. Congress, from both parties, are watching closely and could move to clamp down on Myanmar themselves if they think Obama is moving too quickly. Last month, Senators Cory Gardner and Ben Cardin, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Foreign Relations Asia subcommittee, wrote to Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew expressing concern about rights, and asking the administration to work with Congress to ensure those concerns were addressed.  ‚ÄúLike you, we want to ensure that the U.S. is Burma‚Äôs strongest supporter on its road to democracy,‚Äù the senators said in the letter, seen by Reuters. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Aung San Suu Kyi supported the extension of U.S. sanctions with some changes. Discussions with her have focused on how to properly target trade restrictions so they do not hurt Myanmar‚Äôs overall economy, but keep pressure on military-owned institutions, they said. ‚ÄúWe are looking to take steps to demonstrate our support for the new democratically elected government of Burma ...and that we‚Äôre taking the necessary steps to ensure that they succeed, that they can carry on economic developments and reforms,‚Äù a senior administration official told Reuters. ‚ÄúAt the same time we want to do that in a smart, measured way that gives us a range of options and flexibility to respond appropriately going forward,‚Äù the official added. The United States is eager to expand relations with Myanmar to help counteract China‚Äôs rise in Asia and take advantage of the opening of one of the world‚Äôs last ‚Äúfrontier markets,‚Äù growing but less developed emerging economies. Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions adviser at the U.S. Treasury, said despite an easing of some banking sanctions by the United States since 2012, transactions with Myanmar were still difficult. ‚ÄúI suspect the changes that get announced all drive at the same end goal: which is to promote and make easier the trade and business relationships between the two countries and encourage continued reform while minding concerns,‚Äù said Kucik. ‚ÄúThe details will really indicate where the principal areas of remaining concern are but broadly speaking they are going to be aligned with what we‚Äôve seen so far,‚Äù he said.

RNC's Priebus takes dim view of anti-Trump third party talk,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the Republican National Committee sought on Friday to tamp down talk among some Republicans about the possibility of running a third-party candidate who would give party supporters a choice beyond Donald Trump. In an interview, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said a third-party candidate would have no hope of actually winning the Nov. 8 presidential election but would instead ensure victory for the Democratic nominee. ‚ÄúThey may as well jump off the top floor of a building because that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd be doing by having a third party,‚Äù Priebus said. Priebus has been a vocal advocate for party loyalists to get over their concerns about Trump and support him since he is on track to become the presidential nominee and stands as the only real option for Republicans to win the White House. He brought Trump together with House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan for a meeting in Washington on Thursday to try to ease Ryan‚Äôs concerns about backing the billionaire.  Ryan stopped short of endorsing Trump but said the session was productive. Priebus said the two men have opened a dialogue. ‚ÄúMy guess is they may even be talking today and through the weekend (on the phone),‚Äù he said. Priebus said a Democratic victory would allow Democrats to reshape the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. If Republican donors sit on the sidelines, Democrats could also take over control of the U.S. Senate, he said. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt participate in the presidential election you might as well kiss away the Senate as well,‚Äù Priebus said in a message directed at Republican donors unenthusiastic about Trump. ‚ÄúThe Senate goes as the presidential race goes. They‚Äôre inextricably intertwined.‚Äù Some Republicans continue to hold out hope that a leading figure in the party could be persuaded to run for president as a third-party candidate to give party voters uncomfortable with Trump a candidate to rally around. Some speculation has centered around 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who has been a frequent critic of Trump. Just this week Romney said Trump should release his tax records, a public disclosure move that Romney made in 2012 but which Trump has been resisting. Some Republicans have been urging Romney to launch an independent bid for the presidency. He discussed the issue last week with William Kristol, editor of the conservative-leaning Weekly Standard magazine, a source close to Romney said. ",politicsNews,"May 13, 2016 "
